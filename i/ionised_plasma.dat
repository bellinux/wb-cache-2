Since the magnetic field accelerates the escaping plasma, the rotation of the star is braked.

5000|$|The {{standard}} solar model (SSM) is {{a mathematical}} {{treatment of the}} Sun as a spherical ball of gas (in varying states of ionisation, with the hydrogen in the deep interior being a completely <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma).</b> This model, technically the spherically symmetric quasi-static model of a star, has stellar structure described by several differential equations derived from basic physical principles. The model is constrained by boundary conditions, namely the luminosity, radius, age and composition of the Sun, which are well determined. The age of the Sun cannot be measured directly; one way to estimate {{it is from the}} age of the oldest meteorites, and models of the evolution of the Solar System. The composition in the photosphere of the modern-day Sun, by mass, is 74.9% hydrogen and 23.8% helium. All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2 percent of the mass. The SSM is used to test the validity of stellar evolution theory. In fact, the only way to determine the two free parameters of the stellar evolution model, the helium abundance and the mixing length parameter (used to model convection in the Sun), are to adjust the SSM to [...] "fit" [...] the observed Sun.|$|E

We have derived a general EM dispersion relation by using a two-fluids magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. Our analysis shows that the neutral dynamics is playing an extremely {{important role in the}} physics of magnetised partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> by giving rise to new kind of EM modes. We found (1) the new instability is linked with compressibility of neutral particles, the collision between neutral and charged species and the relative streaming in hot/cold, inhomogeneous, magnetised partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma,</b> (2) and that neutral dynamics is responsible for the modified (complex) inertial effect on magnetic field lines. Its consequences on the propagation characteristics of Alfvén wave and cyclotron frequency are discussed. Furthermore, a new mode similar to the Langmuir mode is reported.

40|$|When {{modeling}} astrophysical fluid flows, it {{is often}} appropriate to discard the canonical magnetohydrodynamic approximation thereby freeing the magnetic field to diffuse {{with respect to the}} bulk velocity field. As a consequence, however, the induction equation can become problematic to solve via standard explicit techniques. In particular, the Hall diffusion term admits fast-moving whistler waves which can impose a vanishing timestep limit. Within an explicit differencing framework, a multifluid scheme for weakly <b>ionised</b> <b>plasmas</b> is presented which relies upon a new approach to integrating the induction equation efficiently. The first component of this approach is a relatively unknown method of accelerating the integration of parabolic systems by enforcing stability over large compound timesteps rather than over each of the constituent substeps. This method, Super Time Stepping, proves to be very effective in applying a part of the Hall term up to a known critical value. The excess of the Hall term above this critical value is then included via a new scheme for pure Hall diffusion.

40|$|In {{partially}} <b>ionised</b> <b>plasmas,</b> {{the magnetic}} field can become decoupled from the neutral gas and diffuse through it in {{a process known as}} ambipolar diffusion. Although ambipolar diffusion has been implemented in several grid codes, we here provide an implementation in smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD). We use the strong coupling approximation in which the ion density is negligible, allowing a single fluid approach. The equations are derived to conserve energy, and to provide a positive definite contribution to the entropy. We test the implementation in both a simple 1 D SPMHD code and the fully 3 D code PHANTOM. The wave damping test yields agreement within 0. 03 - 2 per cent of the analytical result, depending on the value of the collisional coupling constant. The oblique C-shocks test yields results that typically agree within 4 per cent of the semi-analytical result. Our algorithm is therefore suitable for exploring the effect ambipolar diffusion has on physical processes, such as the formation of stars from molecular clouds.

40|$|Transport {{coefficients}} {{in highly}} <b>ionised</b> <b>plasmas</b> like the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are still ill-constrained. They influence various processes, {{among them the}} mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The observed structure of potential mixing layers {{can be used to}} infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requires a detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the KHI under different conditions. Here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effect of constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full range of possible values. We show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth of the KHI and reduce the height of the KHI rolls and their rolling-up. Viscosities above a critical value suppress the KHI. The effect can be quantified in terms of the Reynolds number Re = Uλ/ν, where U is the shear velocity, λ the perturbation length, and ν the kinematic viscosity. We derive the critical Re for constant and temperature dependent, Spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous KHI growth time as a function of Re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours for Spitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. Finally, we briefly discuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous KHI could play a role, i. e., sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyant cavities, ICM turbulence, and high velocity clouds.

Twenty-two subjects with normal or moderately elevated BP participated in the present study, undertaken to investigate the interactions between systemic calcium metabolism and BP during a two-hour constant-rate calcium infusion in the absence and in the presence of concomitant verapamil infusion. During the infusion there was an increase in <b>plasma</b> <b>ionised</b> calcium by 0. 40 mmol/l, SBP rose by 14 mmHg, and DBP by 9. 7 mmHg.

Conversely, higher basal BPs were associated with greater tissue calcium uptake during the infusions. This relationship was abolished when verapamil was present. The present findings extend the previous observations of continuous relationships between indices of calcium metabolism and BP and indicate that both a direct effect of the calcium ion and indirect effects, as evidenced by cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion, affect the BP response to acute hypercalcaemia...|$|R

40|$|This {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{dissipative}} instability that appears in a compressible partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> slab embedded in a uniform magnetic field, modelling {{the state of the}} plasma in solar prominences. In the partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma,</b> the dominant dissipative effect is the Cowling resistivity. The regions outside the slab (modelling the solar corona) are fully ionised, and the dominant mechanism of dissipation is viscosity. Analytical solutions to the extended magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations are found inside and outside of the slab and solutions are matched at the boundaries of the slab. The dispersion relation is derived and solutions are found analytically in the slender slab limit, while the conditions necessary for the appearance of the instability is investigated numerically for the entire parameter space. Our study is focussed on the effect of the compressibility on the generation and evolution of instabilities. We find that compressibility reduces the threshold of the equilibrium flow, where waves can be unstable, to a level that is comparable to the internal cusp speed, which is of the same order of flow speeds that are currently observed in solar prominences. Our study addresses only the slow waves, as these are the most likely perturbations to become unstable, however the time-scales of the instability are found to be rather large ranging from $ 10 ^ 5 $-$ 10 ^ 7 $ seconds. It is determined that the instability threshold is further influenced by the concentration of neutrals and the strength of the viscosity of the corona. Interestingly, these two latter aspects have opposite effects. Our numerical analysis shows that the interplay between the equilibrium flow, neutrals and dispersion can change considerably the nature of waves...|$|E
40|$|Solar flare hard X-rays (HXRs) are {{produced}} as bremsstrahlung when an accelerated population of electrons {{interacts with the}} dense chromospheric plasma. HXR observations presented by using the Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) have shown that HXR source sizes are 3 - 6 times more extended in height than those predicted by the standard collisional thick target model (CTTM). Several possible explanations have been put forward including the multi-threaded nature of flare loops, pitch-angle scattering, and magnetic mirroring. However, the nonuniform ionisation (NUI) structure along {{the path of the}} electron beam has not been fully explored as a solution to this problem. <b>Ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> is known to be less effective at producing nonthermal bremsstrahlung HXRs when compared to neutral plasma. If the peak HXR emission was produced in a locally ionised region within the chromosphere, the intensity of emission will be preferentially reduced around this peak, resulting in a more extended source. Due to this effect, along with the associated density enhancement in the upper chromosphere, injection of a beam of electrons into a partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> should result in a HXR source which is substantially more vertically extended relative to that for a neutral target. Here we present the results of a modification to the CTTM which takes into account both a localised form of chromospheric NUI and an increased target density.

A large amount of work has been carried out on plasma etching using halogen plasmas. However, halogen plasmas cause both environmental and handling problems and as a result hydrogen plasmas are often used as a substitute. Gold films are very important in the electronics industry. Several techniques have been proposed for the deposition of conducting gold films, including CVD, PVD, and Sol-gel techniques. In the work outlined in this thesis, a hydrogen plasma was generated at 0. 1 torr using an RF power supply, in order to modify the surfaces of gold (III) chloride films, spin coated onto either a glass or nylon substrate. It has been postulated that if hydrogen atoms will react with a material in a plasma to form a volatile compound (eg. HCl), then the surface will be modified. The aim of this work was to create a conducting gold film, by removal of chlorine species from the original spin coated film, through use of a hydrogen plasma. The results of this work demonstrate that chlorine removal from the original film, by use of a hydrogen plasma, {{is a function of the}} concentration of the spin coated AuCl(_ 3); the plasma treatment time; and the plasma power.

40|$|This thesis covers {{essentially}} {{two problems}} in the kinetic theory of plasmas. The first concerns the investigation of plasma oscillations in a constant electric field - a topic investigated by Akheizer and Sitenko as early as 1956 [1] More recently Stenflo [2] has considered the problem in which he replaces the collision integral of Boltzmann's equation by a Fokker-Planck term and a B. G. K. term. The dispersion relations derived by Stenflo contained a number of parameters {{the relative importance of}} which he did not clearly define. We have undertaken here a stability study of longitudinal oscillations of a weakly ionised gas permeated by a uniform electric field. A dispersion relation is formulated in terms of error-type functions and some computational studies are carried out for various plasma parameters of interest. The results are exhibited graphically in the form of Nyquist plots. The conclusions made by Stenflo and others regarding possible instabilities of the plasma needs modification, certainly {{in the context of a}} weakly ionised electron-ion gas. The second topic covered here concerns the transport theory of relativistic gases. This has received increasing attention in recent years [3, 4]. Much attention has been devoted to calculating the first order relativistic effects on the transport coefficients. Up to now only the 'Maxwellian' model, investigated by Israel [3], has been considered. The method of attack is via the Chapman-Enskog approach.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} dissipative instability appearing in a prominence planar thread filled with partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> in the incompressible limit. The importance of partial ionisation is investigated {{in terms of the}} ionisation factor and wavelength of waves propagating in the slab. To highlight the role of partial ionisation, we have constructed models describing various situations we can meet in solar prominence fine structure. Matching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total pressure at the interfaces between the prominence slab and surrounding plasmas, we derived a dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution of the instability. Results are obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. We have investigated the appearance of instabilities in prominence dark plumes using single and two-fluid approximations. We show that dissipative instabilities appear for flow speeds that are less than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability threshold. The onset of instability is determined by the equilibrium flow strength, the ionisation factor of the plasma, the wavelength of waves and the ion-neutral collisional rate. For a given wavelength and for ionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas, the propagating waves become unstable for a narrow band of flow speeds, meaning that neutrals have a stabilising effect. Our results show that the partially <b>ionised</b> <b>plasma</b> describing prominence dark plumes becomes unstable only in a two-fluid (charged particles-neutrals) model, that is for periods that are smaller than the ion-neutral collision time. The present study improves our understanding of stability of solar prominences and the role of partial ionisation in destabilising the plasma. We show the necessity of two-fluid approximation when discussing the nature of instabilities: waves in a single fluid approximation show a great deal of stability. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

Vitamin D metabolites, bone mineral content and density were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and <b>plasma</b> <b>ionised</b> calcium, <b>plasma</b> alkaline phosphatase, and intact parahormone measurements were used to evaluate outcomes.  RESULTS—The 25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations tended to be higher in infants receiving 960 IU/day, but the differences did not reach significance at any age. There was no difference between the infants receiving low or high vitamin D dose in bone mineral content nor in bone mineral density at 3 and 6 months corrected age, even after taking potential risk factors into account.  CONCLUSIONS—A vitamin D dose of 200 IU/kg of body weight/day up to a maximum of 400 IU/day maintains normal vitamin D status and as good a bone mineral accretion as the previously recommended higher dose of 960 IU/day.

This supports the notion of a continuous sequence of X-ray properties from the Galactic Centre through LINER galaxies to Seyferts, likely determined by the amount of material available for accretion in the central regions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{believed}} that turbulence is an important process in the evolution and dynamics of molecular clouds and can signiﬁcantly impact the processes of star formation inside these clouds. The aim of this project is to investigate the properties of multiﬂuid magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in weakly <b>ionised</b> astrophysical <b>plasmas</b> such as molecular clouds. To do this the formation of structures through which energy can be dissipated, identiﬁed primarily by the structures of high cur rent density, will be studied. Ambipolar diﬀusion dominated systems will be studied {{with a view to}} discovering the impact this eﬀect has on the formation of structures and magnetic ﬁeld topology. The resulting statistics on dissipative structure formation will be compared with ideal MHD simulations. The formation of sheet-like structures is thought to be intrinsic to systems such as those outlined above, so {{a better understanding of the}} physical processes involved is a stepping stone in the development of better models for the early phases of star formation...|$|R
