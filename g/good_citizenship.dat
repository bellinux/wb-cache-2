For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for <b>good</b> <b>citizenship</b> like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E
5|$|The current youth {{programme}} {{has been}} developed from Baden-Powell's original Scout training scheme, which aimed to encourage personal achievement and {{provide a framework for}} the activities of the Scout Troop. In the Boy Scout section, this consisted of the award of badges for Tenderfoot, Second and First Class Scout and finally King's Scout, which were earned by passing tests {{in a wide variety of}} skills associated with the outdoors, health and <b>good</b> <b>citizenship.</b> With the creation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, a similar system was devised, the awards being Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star, and an award called the Leaping Wolf was added later which required Cubs to move up to the Scout Troop. In parallel with this scheme, Cubs and Scouts were able to earn Proficiency Badges for specific skills and hobbies, an idea that Baden-Powell probably copied from Ernest Thompson Seton. The test requirements for Baden-Powell's scheme were revised in 1944 and again in 1958 without altering the basic structure.|$|E

In this article, I challenge this prevailing view, by arguing that <b>good</b> international <b>citizenship</b> frequently involves discharging special responsibilities to protect, which in turn involves grants of asylum to refugees. While arguing that asylum should be seen as an important element of <b>good</b> international <b>citizenship</b> as a matter of course, it assumes an even more central role in this citizenship in two scenarios. The first is where humanitarian intervention is either imprudent or politically impossible without violating the procedural norms of international society.

25|$|British Columbia was {{the first}} to {{establish}} an honour that was distinct to the province: the Order of the Dogwood Medallion, created for the centennial of the Province and its preceding Colony of British Columbia in 1957, and reformed into the Order of the Dogwood in 1966. After the establishment of the Canadian honours system in 1967, the rest of the provinces, recognizing the Crown's distinct operation within each provincial jurisdiction, moved to establish their own honours after Ottawa declined to do so on their behalf. Ontario {{was the first}}, creating the Ontario Medal for <b>Good</b> <b>Citizenship</b> in 1973, and the Police and Firefighter's Bravery Medals in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Alberta followed with the Alberta Order of Excellence in 1979. Quebec was the first province to establish a true order: l'Ordre national du Quebec in 1984. The Saskatchewan Order of Merit was established in 1985. The Order of Ontario came in 1986, the Order of British Columbia in 1989 (which replaced the Order of the Dogwood), the Order of Prince Edward Island in 1997, the Order of Manitoba in 1999, and the Order of Nova Scotia, of New Brunswick, and of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001. However, the federal government did not recognize these honours and decorations, fearing duplications and citing the fact that, aside from the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Queen had not authorized them. The provinces responded by stating that since provincial ministers did not constitutionally have the right to advise the sovereign directly, they would do so via legislation under the prerogative of the provincial Crown. The federal government finally came to recognize provincial orders after a compromise was reached between Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn and Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan Sylvia Fedoruk, wherein provincial honours established by legislation or order in council would be ranked below all national honours, but above national decorations.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Marcus in Minders of Make-Believe: Idealists, Entrepreneurs, and the Shaping of American Children's Literature, says [...] "Tunis's {{books were}} never only about sports", noting [...] "the author's {{determination}} {{to offer his}} readers basic lessons about <b>good</b> <b>citizenship</b> and fair play, {{and a chance to}} reflect on such rarely discussed social issues as racial equality and anti-Semitism". A doctoral study at Oklahoma State University in 1996 analyzed all of Tunis' juvenile sports books. The predominant value found both in the books and their main characters was Courtesy/Fairness/Respect. The second most identified value was Compassion/Kindness. The study found that [...] "the values are not portrayed didactically, as part of lessons, but rather as a natural part of the stories". In his book What Would Frank Merriwell Do?, Ryan Anderson also pointed out the recurring theme of fairness and sportsmanship over winning in both Tunis' fiction and non-fiction, saying [...] "The common thread winding through all his writing became his dismay over the nation's tendency to value winning above common decency." [...] In turning from primarily writing non-fiction for adults to juvenile fiction Tunis did not abandon his emphasis on values over victory, but it did give him an audience that seemed more willing to listen.|$|E

500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in <b>good</b> <b>citizenship,</b> commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E

40|$|According to Evans (2007, [URL] for {{political}} actors to be "good international citizens," {{they ought to}} recognize and promote respect for core human rights in their foreign policy, engage in vigorous multilateral cooperation, and contribute to positive change where possible. This study assesses this approach {{in the context of}} EU foreign policy, by asking two questions: (i) what sort of ethically oriented action should be expected of a foreign policy actor in the current global system?; (ii) what are the barriers to achieving such action that naturally arise in that system, given the way it is constructed? We argue that the answer lies in recognizing not only the practical challenges or constraints, but also the normative constraints facing such actors in a foreign policy framework. First, we apply a <b>good</b> international <b>citizenship</b> framework in the case of EU foreign policy. We then assess EU actions {{in the context of the}} Middle East peace process, focusing on the efforts the union has made, and ones it might make toward "punching its weight," consistent with <b>good</b> international <b>citizenship.</b> The assessment of the case, and the analysis of <b>good</b> international <b>citizenship</b> overall, highlight a gap between moral outcomes sought by many critics of EU foreign policy action and outcomes that should be routinely achievable in the present system.
