5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a <b>diverging</b> <b>track.</b> The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
25|$|On March 7, 1990, {{four people}} were killed and another 162 injured when the rear three cars of six-car train #61 derailed after leaving 30th Street Station {{westbound}} at 8:20a.m. It is believed that one of the traction motors dropped out of the rear truck on the third car (M3) somewhere between 15th and 30th street stations, and it became entangled in a switch immediately upon leaving 30th street station. The front truck of the fourth car (M3 #818) followed the third car, while the rear truck of the fourth car took the <b>diverging</b> <b>track,</b> causing the car to shear halfway upon striking the steel pillars separating the tracks beyond the switch.|$|E
60|$|Hunky Ben was pre-eminently {{a man of}} action. As he uttered {{or thought}} the last word he gave a little chirp which sent Black Polly along the <b>diverging</b> <b>track</b> at a speed which almost {{justified}} the comparison of her to lightning.|$|E

5000|$|Leutkirch {{station is}} the station {{of the town}} of Leutkirch im Allgäu in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is {{classified}} by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station and has two platform tracks. The station is located on the network of the Bodensee-Oberschwaben Verkehrsverbund (Lake Constance-Upper Swabia Transport Association, bodo) and belongs to fare zone 68. The address of the station is Bahnhof 1. [...] The station was opened on 1 September 1872 as the terminus of the Württemberg Allgäu Railway. On 14 August 1874, {{with the opening of the}} line to Isny, it became a through station. In preparation for the opening of the line to Memmingen on 2 October 1889 when Leutkirch became a railway junction, the current station building was built between the <b>diverging</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R

50|$|South of this station, a non-revenue <b>track</b> <b>diverges</b> {{from the}} {{outbound}} track that connects with the outbound track on the shared Orange/Blue/Silver Line tracks between Farragut West and McPherson Square.|$|R
50|$|On {{the west}} end of the station there are only two tracks, but by the east end of the station, the {{northern}} <b>track</b> has <b>diverged</b> to three <b>tracks.</b> The side platform only serves the south track.|$|R
5000|$|The longest set {{of points}} {{in the world was}} {{installed}} in Bitterfeld station in January 1998. This 169.2 metre-long construction is passable at 220 km/h (in normal operations at up to 200 km/h) on the <b>diverging</b> <b>track.</b> Switch 03 at the northern end of Bitterfeld station thus allows trains from Leipzig to Berlin to pass through on the line from Halle without reducing speed. The point blades are each 59 metres long and weigh 120 tons, including their support mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|A switch {{generally}} has a straight [...] "through" [...] track (such as the main-line) and a diverging route. The handedness of the installation {{is described by}} the side that the <b>diverging</b> <b>track</b> leaves. Right-hand switches have a diverging path {{to the right of}} the straight track, when coming from the point blades, and a left-handed switch has the <b>diverging</b> <b>track</b> leaving to the opposite side. In many cases, such as rail yards, many switches can be found in a short section of track, sometimes with switches going both to the right and left (although it is better to keep these separated as much as feasible). Sometimes a switch merely divides one track into two; at others, it serves as a connection between two or more parallel tracks, allowing a train to switch between them. In many cases, where a switch is supplied to leave a track, a second is supplied to allow the train to reenter the track some distance down the line; this allows the track to serve as a siding, allowing a train to get off the track to allow traffic to pass (this siding can either be a dedicated short length of track, or formed from a section of a second, continuous, parallel line), and also allows trains coming from either direction to switch between lines; otherwise, the only way for a train coming from the opposite direction to use a switch would be to stop, and reverse through the switch onto the other line, and then continue forwards (or stop, if it is being used as a siding).|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "HOLMES" [...] Block Station (Holmesburg Junction), late 1970s. The Bustleton Branch diverged here (center of picture) and the K&T Branch <b>diverged</b> {{from the}} <b>track</b> leading the {{crossover}} {{at the bottom}} left. The tower closed in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Where <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge,</b> {{a section}} of {{gauntlet}} track may be provided where the switches require to be located remote from the actual divergence. This arrangement is most commonly used on tram systems, to move the switches away from a heavily trafficked road.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{physical}} junction was removed, {{there is a}} stub of the M&SWJR remaining to serve military installations at Ludgershall. This stub is connected to a goods line from Andover which runs alongside the main line until the <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge</b> {{at the site of}} Red Post Junction.|$|R
5000|$|The May 2002 Potters Bar rail crash at Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom, {{occurred}} when a switch sprang {{to a different}} position as a coach crossed it, a type of mishap called [...] "splitting the switch." [...] The front wheels of a coach progressed along the straight track as intended, but the rear wheels slewed along the <b>diverging</b> <b>track.</b> This caused the whole coach to detach from the train and slew sideways across the platform ahead. The movement of the switch occurred beneath the final coach, so that although seven people were killed, the front coaches remained on the tracks. Poor maintenance of the points {{was found to be}} the primary cause of the crash.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that all the circular arcs, at least in its initial or final area, were a part of the turnout’s {{diverging}} tracks, two kinds of transition curves might have been used. The compound curve consisting of transition arc with 50  m radius and length of 5.236  m was used in <b>diverging</b> <b>track</b> of turnout. When the arc was combined with the straight section, two kinds of transitions can be applied: cubic parabola or compound arc consisting of two transition arcs (5.236  m length) with the 100 and 50  m radius each with 5.236  m length [15].|$|E
50|$|North of the station, {{a single}} <b>track</b> <b>diverges</b> {{northeast}} to East New York Yard, two tracks proceed to Broadway Junction, {{and two others}} connect to the Jamaica Line. These last two are not used for regular revenue service, and have not been used thusly since 1968.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} two vestibules, each {{containing}} one side platform and one track for trains {{in a given}} direction. The platforms are connected through several corridors. There are railroad switches at the far western end of each platform, where the HOB-WTC line's <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge.</b> As a result, only NWK-WTC trains can serve the whole platform ...|$|R
5000|$|A flying {{junction}} or flyover is {{a railway}} junction at which {{one or more}} <b>diverging</b> or converging <b>tracks</b> in a multiple-track route cross other tracks on the route by bridge to avoid conflict with other train movements. A more technical term is [...] "grade-separated junction". A burrowing junction or dive-under occurs where the diverging line passes below the main line.|$|R
5000|$|Large (~30 cm wide) trails with a scrape mark from {{a central}} tail. Three to four {{footprint}} pits <b>diverge</b> from these <b>tracks</b> {{at a high}} angle. The feet making the footprints had spines on their rears. These may have been formed by eurypterids but aren't a perfect match to known eurypterid trails; they {{may also have been}} formed by Xiphosurans ...|$|R
5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge,</b> curving south to 15th Street and Prospect Park West, while the express tracks take a direct route beneath Prospect Park. This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where the express <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge</b> from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the last stop of the original IND service.|$|R
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a <b>diverging</b> section of <b>track.</b> Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of point}} {{gauntlet}} {{is also used}} on the South Shore Line (NICTD) railroad at stations in Hegewisch in Illinois and Hammond and East Chicago in Indiana. (SouthShore Freight runs freight trains on the NICTD line.) A frog gauntlet section on the NICTD line in Gary, Indiana, was removed in 1997 after a 1993 fatal near head on accident where the <b>tracks</b> <b>diverged.</b>|$|R
50|$|North of {{the station}} there is a double {{crossover}} between the southbound local track and the center express track. Also north of this station, there is a switch from the center express track to the northbound local track. There was formerly a switch to the south, and the girder that formerly supported such a switch indicates {{that it was a}} <b>track</b> <b>diverging</b> from the northbound local track to the middle track.|$|R
5000|$|NMEs Victoria Segal, however, {{was less}} {{impressed}} with the LP, stating that the album [...] "is a flooded engine of a record". [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian surmised that Going For Gold showed Shed Sevens [...] "real talent" [...] to be [...] "persistence" [...] and thought that the album lacked diversity; [...] "Few of the <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge</b> from the doggedly catchy guitar rockin model set by their first hit, Dolphin".|$|R
50|$|At the up {{end of the}} station, the <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge.</b> Express Flinders Street trains {{take the}} direct double track route to Newport station, while local Laverton-Altona shuttle trains run on the single track route to Newport via Altona. Until June 2015, Geelong and Warrnambool line trains ran through the station, but those {{services}} now use the Regional Rail Link route via Wyndham Vale. The Western standard gauge line passes {{to the west of}} Platform 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1954, {{along with the}} rest of the branch from the {{junction}} at Gràcia station. It has a single terminal track, which ends at a buffer within the station. Just outside the Gràcia end of the station, this <b>track</b> <b>diverges</b> into the twin running tracks of the L7. The terminal track is flanked on both sides by 66 m long platforms, which can accommodate a three car train.|$|R
5000|$|Taw Valley Halt {{railway station}} {{is the current}} (and temporary) {{southern}} terminus of the Swindon and Cricklade Railway, a heritage railway line in Wiltshire, South-West England. The restored line was extended {{to the site of}} the halt in 2012, and the halt was opened in 2014.The halt is at the point where the new <b>track</b> <b>diverges</b> from the original route of the Midland and South Western Junction Railway.

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at the {{tracking}} filters {{are liable to}} <b>diverge</b> and the <b>tracking</b> precision is low when tracking nonlinear maneuvering target, an Interacting Multiple Model Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter (IMMSCKF) is developed by introducing Square-root Cubature Kalman Filter (SCKF) into Interacting Multiple Model (IMM). This method uses SCKF for filtering each model, the weighted sum of the outputs of all parallel SCKF is taken as the output of IMMSCKF. Simulation shows that IMMSCKF has higher precision, quicker model switching speed, and smaller calculation cost compared with IMMUKF...|$|R
50|$|Following Mossiface {{the trail}} {{continues}} north for about 2.5 km on a smooth gravel surface and crosses the Great Alpine Road {{at the site}} of a former railway trestle bridge which used to take the railway over the highway. Just past the trestle bridge, 2 km out of Bruthen, the <b>track</b> <b>diverges,</b> with one route (the Bruthen-Wiseleigh path) travelling alongside the Great Alpine Road directly into Bruthen, while the rail trail proper continues to follow the route of the old railway about 100m north of the road.|$|R
50|$|Both {{ends of the}} connector, which {{cuts through}} former farmland, have wyes along with signals that {{regulate}} the flow of train traffic that passes through the connector. Trains traveling on the former ATSF tracks enter the wye at a southwest-northeast angle.At {{the south end of}} the northern wye, the two tracks converge to one track, briefly traveling southeast, before the two <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge</b> to form the northern part of the southern wye, through which trains enter the former Burlington tracks, which travel directly east-west.|$|R
5000|$|Also in Germany, in Krefeld on Ostwall {{the tram}} lines are dual-gauge track, to allow both {{standard}} [...] Rheinbahn U76 Stadtbahn cars {{to share this}} section with Krefeld's [...] At {{the north end of}} the street at the junction with Rheinstraße, Rheinbahn trams reverse, so the standard gauge ends, while the metre gauge lines continue. The dual-gauge track continues along Oppumer Straße in front of Krefeld Hauptbahnhof (Main Rail Station), where at both ends of this street, the metre [...] and standard [...] <b>tracks</b> <b>diverge.</b>|$|R
