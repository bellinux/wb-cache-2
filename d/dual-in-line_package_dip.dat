40|$|The AD 7869 is a {{complete}} 14 -bit I/O system containing a DAC and an ADC. The ADC is a successive approximation type with a track-and-hold amplifier, having a combined throughput rate of 83 kHz. The DAC has an output buffer amplifier with a settling time of 4 µs to 14 bits. Temperature compensated 3 V buried Zener references provide precision references for the DAC and ADC. Interfacing to both the DAC and ADC is serial, minimizing pin count and giving a small 24 -pin package size. Standard control signals allow serial interfacing to most DSP machines. Asynchronous ADC conversion control and DAC updating is made possible with the CONVST and LDAC logic inputs. The AD 7869 operates from ± 5 V power supplies; the analog input/output range of the ADC/DAC is ± 3 V. The part is fully specified for dynamic parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio and harmonic distortion as well as traditional dc specifications. The part is available in a 24 -pin, 0. 3 inch wide, plastic or hermetic <b>dual-in-line</b> <b>package</b> (<b>DIP)</b> and in a 28 -pin, plastic SOIC package. TFS TCL...|$|E
40|$|The AD 9070 is a {{monolithic}} sampling analog-to-digital converter with an on-chip track-and-hold circuit and ECL digital interfaces. The product operates at a 100 MSPS conversion rate with outstanding dynamic performance over its full operating range. The ADC requires {{only a single}} – 5 V supply and an encode clock for full performance operation. The digital outputs are ECL compatible, while a differential clock input accommodates {{a wide range of}} logic levels. The AD 9070 may be operated in a Positive ECL (PECL) environment with a single + 5 V supply. An Out-of-Range output (OR) is available in the DIP version to indicate that a conversion result is outside the operating range. In both package styles, the output data are held at saturation levels during an out-of-range condition. The input amplifier supports single-ended interfaces. An internal – 2. 5 V reference is included in the SOIC packaged device (an external voltage reference is required for the DIP version). Fabricated on an advanced bipolar process, the AD 9070 is available in a plastic SOIC package specified over the industrial temperature range (– 40 °C to + 85 °C), and a full MIL-PRF- 38534 QML version (– 55 °C to + 125 °C) in a ceramic <b>Dual-in-Line</b> <b>Package</b> (<b>DIP)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Optocoupler is a {{semiconductor}} device that allows signal {{to be transferred}} between circuits, while keeping the circuits electrically isolated from each other. The demand of surface mount Optocoupler packaging has progressed from a conventional <b>Dual-in-line</b> <b>packaging</b> (<b>DIP)</b> to Small outline packaging (SOP) to miniflat packaging (MFP) and to Ball Grid Array Packaging (BGA) for Optocoupler. This innovative design employs the use of premolded lead frame technology offering thinner and smaller package structure. The need to maintain a consistent interconnect dispense material at die attach is very critical to attain a reliable adhesion of the epoxy to the die and to the substrate. Stamping or pin transfer approach was qualified as a die attach dispense system.

50|$|After their {{introduction}} in {{integrated circuit}} form in 1963 by Sylvania, TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies. The 7400 series (also called 74xx) by Texas Instruments became particularly popular. TTL manufacturers offered {{a wide range}} of logic gate, flip-flops, counters, and other circuits. Several variations of the original TTL circuit design were developed. The variations offered interchangeable functions that had higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic <b>dual-in-line</b> (<b>DIP)</b> <b>packages,</b> and flat-pack form. TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount packages.|$|R

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{industry is}} concerned about the delamination of plastic-encapsulated IC packages to assure high quality of products. Much effort has been invested by the electronics industry to evaluate and optimize the most popcorn free conditions during the process of packaging and assembly. However, it may be interesting to know the degree of delamination of IC packages that are already mounted on boards. A delamination survey of various IC packages from several used electronic products including cellular phones, VCR, discman, display card, graphic card and motherboard for desktop computer is conducted and presented in this paper. C-mode Scanning Acoustic Microscope (C-SAM) and X-ray Microscope is used to investigate delamination and possibly other defects like wire-sweep or cracking. IC packages under survey included Thin Small Outline Package (TSOP), Small Outline Integrated Circuit (SOIC), Small Outline J-Lead Package (SOJ), Pall Grid Array (BGA), Quad Flat Package (QFP), Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC), Chip-on-Flex (COF), <b>Dual-in-line</b> <b>Package</b> (<b>DIP),</b> Single in-line Package (SIP) as well as Flip Chip. Some packages were found to have delamination. The most common type of delamination seem to be on the die paddle, both front and backside. One chip showed a topside delamination of about 35 % together with 26 % on backside of package. However, it is still considered acceptable according to JEDEC criteria. X-ray survey for other defects such as wiresweep was not found...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>dual-in-line</b> <b>package</b> {{was invented}} by Bryant [...] "Buck" [...] Rogers in 1964 while working for Fairchild Semiconductor. The first devices had 14 pins and looked much like they do today. The rectangular shape allowed integrated circuits to be packaged more densely than previous round packages. The package was well-suited to automated assembly equipment; a PCB could be populated with scores or hundreds of ICs, then all the components on the circuit board could be soldered at one time on a wave soldering machine and passed on to automated testing machines, with very little human labor required. <b>DIP</b> <b>packages</b> were still large {{with respect to the}} integrated circuits within them. By the end of the 20th century, surface-mount packages allowed further reduction in the size and weight of systems. DIP chips are still popular for circuit prototyping on a breadboard because of how easily they can be inserted and utilized there.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical and {{chemical}} process challenges initially limited acceptance of {{surface mount technology}} (SMT). As those challenges have been overcome, another obstacle has become apparent: electronic test access. Through-hole components on a 100 mil grid allowed physical aceess. SMT which has provided new levels of packing density has also denied physical test access. To overcome this challenge, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has sponsored a new standard, IEEE 1149. 1 - 1990, the Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture. THE SMT ASSEMBLY CHALLENGE The use of SMT has required the refinement of several technologies including: photolithographic improvements in printed circuit etching, computer aided layout to support routing {{the large number of}} interconnects, and soldering to allow devices to be attached to first one and then the reverse side of the printed wiring board (PWB) without through-hole mechanical capture. Equipment to pick and place fragile SMT components with adequate alignment to the prepared pad area was needed to assure high yield assembly.
