5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that he could maintain the consistency in the character {{only because of the}} fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview,</b> {{he needed to get}} away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
25|$|Before The Annoying Orange, Boedigheimer {{had done}} many talking food videos for his channel and other sites {{including}} JibJab. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> {{that the idea}} for The Annoying Orange {{was a combination of}} the talking food videos, puns and special effects he came up with and did before. The original video was planned to be titled The Annoying Apple, but when he started animating the video he found it easier to put features on an orange than an apple and make it clear.|$|E
25|$|On October 29, 2014, a {{few hours}} after being {{appointed}} as the interim mayor of Iguala, Luis Mazón Alonso asked for a leave of absence. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that he had decided to resign because some members of the Iguala city council were self-serving and had no interest in improving the situation. He is the brother of Lázaro Mazón Alonso, the former Secretary of Health in Guerrero, who resigned on October 16, 2014 after the former Governor Aguirre accused him of being linked to Abarca.

25|$|In these interviews, Morton {{claimed to}} have been born in 1885. He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been {{slightly}} too young to make a good case for being the inventor of jazz. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> that Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions may stem from different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005, The Complete Library of Congress Recordings. The collection won two Grammy Awards. The same year, Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E
25|$|Hokutoumi was {{primarily}} a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques that got his opponents {{out of the ring}} as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or initial charge, and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the throat. To do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Channel 4 television that the technique he most enjoyed was tsuri-dashi or lift out, although he was only credited with this kimarite once in official tournament competition (against Terao in November 1989).|$|E
