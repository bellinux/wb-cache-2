40|$|Cold-formed {{steel channel}} {{sections}} are generally used as flexural members in light weight steel construction. Improved channel section profiles such as SupaCee sections with longitudinal web stiffeners and curved lips {{are also used}} instead of the conventional lipped channel sections. Web crippling capacities of these innovative sections can be {{different from those of}} conventional lipped channel sections. However, the web crippling behaviour and strength of these high strength SupaCee sections has not been investigated yet. Current web crippling design methods given in cold-formed steel design standards do not include any design procedures for SupaCee sections. Hence an experimental study involving 36 web crippling tests was first undertaken to investigate the web crippling behaviour and strengths of SupaCee sections under two <b>flange</b> load <b>cases</b> with their <b>flanges</b> unfastened to the supports. Comparison of experimental results showed that the web crippling capacities of SupaCee sections are reduced in comparison to lipped channel sections. Therefore the current web crippling design equations in the American and Australian/New Zealand cold-formed steel design standards were modified by including suitable web crippling coefficients for SupeCee sections. Finite element models of tested SupaCee sections were also developed and validated using the experimental results. This paper presents the details of the experimental and numerical web crippling studies of SupaCee sections under two <b>flange</b> load <b>cases</b> and the results. It also presents the details of direct strength method based design equations developed in this research...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{a gasket}} made in soft {{material}} is not recommended for large size centrifugal compressor <b>case</b> <b>flange.</b> The two <b>case</b> halves are assembled with bolted flanges and leakage is prevented by the metal–to–metal contact under pressure. The prediction of the leakage condition is an important engineering issue for this technology. In the paper an original model able to predict the leakage condition, based on a Fracture Mechanics approach, is presented. The flange surfaces interface {{is regarded as a}} crack which can be partially open. As the flanges can not transfer tensile traction, the extension of the open zone, i. e. the crack length, is obtained by the condition that the Stress Intensity Factor K is zero. An analytical model, based on the Weight Function technique, was applied to find the stress intensity K, and then to predict the leakage condition. The paper illustrates a validation of the proposed model by the comparison with a nonlinear Finite Element analysis and the results of a full scale experimental test series obtained by a research collaboration between industry and academia. The leakage pressure predicted by the model is in good agreement with the numerical prediction and the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantage}} of having no unstiffened elements coupled with material {{located away from}} the neutral axis makes hollow flange channel (HFC) beam sections structurally efficient in bending when compared with other commonly used open cold-formed steel sections. This concept is similar to hot-rolled steel sections such as the universal beam and channel beam sections, which are very efficient in bending. However, the hot-rolled sections are heavier, torsionally weak, and have low resistance to flexural-torsional buckling. The two hollow flanges in HFC beams make them torsionally strong and also eliminate the occurrence of distortional and local flange buckling modes in most cases. However, HFC beams have slender webs, making them vulnerable to web crippling failure modes. To understand the web crippling behaviour of HFC beams and develop accurate design rules, finite element models of HFC beams were developed and validated using available experimental results under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One <b>Flange</b> (IOF) load <b>cases.</b> Using the validated finite element models, a detailed parametric study was conducted for many HFC sections. Finite element analyses provided the required elastic buckling and ultimate loads of HFC beams in web crippling (EOF and IOF load cases). New predictive equations were proposed to determine the elastic buckling coefficients of HFC beams, followed by Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules using the test, elastic buckling and nonlinear analysis results from finite element analyses.

40|$|Lipped channel beams (LCBs) are {{commonly}} used as floor joists and bearers in buildings. However, they are subjected to specific failure modes such as web crippling.

In many instances, the predictions by the available design standards such as AISI S 100, AS/NZS 4600 and Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 3 [7 - 9] are inconsistent. Hence thirty-six tests were conducted to assess the web crippling behaviour and strengths of LCBs under two <b>flange</b> load <b>cases.</b> Experimental web crippling capacities were then compared with the predictions from the current design rules.

The LSB has a unique shape of a channel beam with two rectangular hollow flanges, made using a unique manufacturing process.

To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the web crippling behaviour and strength of LSB sections under ETF and ITF load conditions.

Experimental web crippling capacity results were then compared with the predictions from AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design rules, which showed that AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design equations are very unconservative for LSBs under ETF and ITF load cases. Hence improved equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of LSBs. Finite element models of the tested LSBs were then developed, and used to determine the elastic buckling loads of LSBs under ETF and ITF load cases. New equations were proposed to determine the corresponding elastic buckling coefficients of LSBs.

40|$|Thin-walled steel hollow flange channel beams {{known as}} LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{sections}} were developed {{for use as}} joists and bearers in various flooring systems. However, they are subjected to specific buckling and failure modes, one of them being web crippling. Despite considerable research in this area, much of the current design predictions for cold-formed steel sections are not directly applicable to LSBs. This {{is due to the}} geometry of the LSB, which consists of two closed rectangular hollow flanges, and its unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of LSBs with their flanges fastened to supports. Thirty nine web crippling tests were conducted under two <b>flange</b> load <b>cases</b> (End Two <b>Flange</b> (ETF) and Interior Two Flange (ITF)).

40|$|Cold-formed {{steel channel}} {{sections}} are increasingly used as flexural {{members in the}} construction industry. Improved section profiles such as SupaCee sections are also available for use instead of the conventional lipped channel beam (LCB) sections. They contain additional longitudinal web stiffeners and special return lips that enhance their bending and shear capacities. Web crippling capacities of these innovative sections {{are different from those}} of LCBs due to the difference in section geometry. However, no investigation has been conducted into the web crippling behaviour and strength of these high strength SupaCee sections. Current design equations (AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600) do not include any design procedures for such sections with special longitudinal web stiffeners and lips. Hence an experimental study was first conducted to assess the web crippling behaviour and strengths of conventional LCBs and SupaCees under different loading conditions. Seventy two tests of LCB and SupaCee sections were conducted under two <b>flange</b> load <b>cases</b> (ETF and ITF load cases). Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities showed that the web crippling capacities of SupaCee sections are reduced in comparison to LCB sections. Therefore suitable modifications to the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design equations were made by proposing different web crippling coefficients for SupeCee sections. Numerical models were also developed and validated using the experimental results, and were then used in numerical parametric studies.

To determine the bearing capacity of cold-formed channel sections, a unified design equation with different bearing coefficients is given in the current North American specification AISI S 100 and the Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4600. However, coefficients are not available for unlipped channel sections that are normally fastened to supports through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between fastened and unfastened support conditions.

The theoretical computation of web crippling strength is quite complex as it involves a large number of factors such as initial imperfections, local yielding at load application and instability of web. The existing design provision in North American specification for cold-formed steel C-sections (AISI S 100, 2007) to calculate the web-crippling strength is based on the experimental investigation. The objective of this research is to extend the direct strength method to the web crippling strength of cold-formed steel C-sections. ABAQUS is used as a main tool to apply finite element analysis and is used to do the elastic buckling analysis. The work was carried out on C-sections under interior two flange (ITF) loading, end two <b>flange</b> (ETF) loading <b>cases.</b> Total of 128 (58 ITF, 70 ETF) sections were analyzed.

40|$|Reducing {{blade tip}} {{clearances}} through active {{tip clearance control}} in the high pressure turbine can lead to significant reductions in emissions and specific fuel consumption as well as dramatic improvements in operating efficiency and increased service life. Current engines employ scheduled cooling of the outer <b>case</b> <b>flanges</b> to reduce high pressure turbine tip clearances during cruise conditions. These systems have relatively slow response and do not use clearance measurement, thereby forcing cold build clearances to set the minimum clearances at extreme operating conditions (e. g., takeoff, reburst) and not allowing cruise clearances to be minimized due {{to the possibility of}} throttle transients (e. g., step change in altitude). In an effort to improve upon current thermal methods, a first generation mechanically-actuated active clearance control (ACC) system has been designed and fabricated. The system utilizes independent actuators, a segmented shroud structure, and clearance measurement feedback to provide fast and precise active clearance control throughout engine operation. Ambient temperature performance tests of this first generation ACC system assessed individual seal component leakage rates and both static and dynamic overall system leakage rates. The ability of the nine electric stepper motors to control the position of the seal carriers in both open- and closed-loop control modes for single and multiple cycles was investigated. The ability of the system to follow simulated engine clearance transients in closed-loop mode showed the system was able to track clearances to within a tight tolerance (0. 001 in. error) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on hollow flange beams {{has led to}} the development of an innovative rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) for use in floor systems. The new RHFCB is a mono-symmetric structural section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid closed rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate element, which allows section optimisation by selecting appropriate combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses. However, the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not directly applicable to rivet fastened RHFCBs. To date, no investigation has been conducted on their web crippling behaviour and strengths. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs under End Two Flange (ETF) and Interior Two <b>Flange</b> (ITF) load <b>cases.</b> It showed that RHFCBs failed by web crippling, flange crushing and their combinations. Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities with the predictions from the design equations in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 showed that the current design equations are unconservative for rivet fastened RHFCB sections under ETF and ITF load cases.

The rivet fastened RHFCB allows greater section optimisation and flexibility in designing suitable combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses for many industrial applications. In the industrial applications of rivet fastened RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be fastened to supports, which will provide increased web crippling capacities. However no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and fastened to supports under one-flange load cases. Similarly the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not suitable for rivet fastened RHFCBs due to their two hollow flanges. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. It included rivet fastened RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and fastened to supports under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One <b>Flange</b> (IOF) load <b>cases.</b> Tests with <b>flanges</b> fastened to supports showed that web crippling capacities increased by 39 and 5 % for EOF and IOF load cases.

40|$|Derailments are a {{significant}} cost to the Australian sugar industry with damage to rail infrastructure and rolling stock in excess of $ 2 M per annum. Many factors can contribute to cane rail derailments. The more prevalent factors are discussed. Derailment statistics on likely causes for cane rail derailments are presented with the case of empty wagons on the main line being the highest contributor to business cost. Historically, the lateral to vertical wheel load ratio, termed the derailment ratio, {{has been used to}} indicate the derailment probability of rolling stock. When the derailment ratio reaches the Nadal limit of 0. 81 for cane rail operations, there is a high probability that a derailment will occur. Contributing factors for derailments include the operating forces, the geometric variables of the rolling stock and the geometric deviations of the railway track. These combined, have the capacity to affect the risk of derailment for a cane rail transport operating system. The derailment type that is responsible for creating the most damage to assets and creating mill stops is the flange climb derailment, as these derailments usually occur at speed with a full rake of empty wagons. The typical forces that contribute to the <b>flange</b> climb derailment <b>case</b> for cane rail operations are analysed and a practical derailment model is developed to enable operators to better appreciate the most significant contributing factors to this type of derailment.
