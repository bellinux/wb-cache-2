5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of <b>end</b> <b>product</b> made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the <b>end</b> <b>product</b> produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E

Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the <b>end</b> <b>product</b> of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The <b>end</b> <b>product</b> of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present.

40|$|Background: In {{addition}} to {{the important role of}} advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> (AGEs) in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications, recent data suggest that advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> can also impair insulin action in vitro. We have investigated whether circulating advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> are associated with insulin resistance in human subjects independent of metabolic parameters. Methods: Two hundred and seven healthy non-obese non-diabetic subjects (97 male, 110 female) were recruited from the community. Serum levels of advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products,</b> adiponectin, malondialdehyde and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were assayed. Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR). Results: Male subjects had significantly higher body mass index, waist circumference and lower adiponectin level than female subjects and were more insulin resistant. Serum advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> (3. 67 ± 1. 15 unit/mL versus 3. 23 ± 1. 15, p < 0. 05) and malondialdehyde levels (p < 0. 05) were also higher in male than in female subjects. Serum advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> correlated with HOMA-IR in both male (r = 0. 32, p = 0. 004) and female subjects (r = 0. 28, p = 0. 003). Serum adiponectin inversely correlated with HOMA-IR in female (r = - 0. 38, p < 0. 001) but not in male subjects. On multiple regression analysis, serum AGEs remained an independent determinant of HOMA-IR even after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, waist, smoking, adiponectin and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Conclusions: Formation and accumulation of advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> progress during normal ageing.

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The <b>end</b> <b>product</b> would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive <b>end</b> <b>product.</b> Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
40|$|Background: Advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> are {{associated}} with chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. This glycation process renders many proteins immunogenic. Aim: To detect the presence of antibodies against albumin, collagen and low density lipoprotein glycation products in boys and teenagers with diabetes mellitus. Patients and methods: Thirty one patients with diabetes mellitus type I, aged 11 ± 3. 8 years and with a mean duration of disease of 3. 7 ± 2. 7 years and 31 healthy controls aged 12. 4 ± 5. 3 years were studied. Antibodies against glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> were detected by ELISA and results were expressed as a ratio of the optical density of the glycated protein/optical density of the native protein.

High-mobility group box 1 is a high-affinity binding ligand for the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> with cytokine activities and plays a role in sepsis. Design: Controlled, in vivo laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory of a health sciences university. Subjects: C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Interventions: Peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli. Mice received soluble receptor for advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> or anti-high-mobility group box 1 immunoglobulin G, or the appropriate control treatment. Measurements and Main Results: Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products-treated mice demonstrated an enhanced bacterial dissemination to liver and lungs, accompanied by increased hepatocellular injury and exaggerated systemic cytokine release, 20 hrs after intraperitoneal administration of Escherichia coli. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation <b>end</b> <b>products</b> administration in healthy, uninfected mice did not induce an immune response. Remarkably, lung inflammation was unaffected.
