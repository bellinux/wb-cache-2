5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his <b>finger</b> <b>nails.</b> That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his <b>finger</b> <b>nails</b> are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E
500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the <b>finger</b> <b>nails</b> were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E

40|$|From 39 normal {{children}} and 36 patients, suffering from cystic fibrosis (C/F), the copper content of <b>finger</b> <b>nail</b> clippings and toe nail clippings were determined. From this study {{it can be}} concluded that, although the patients with cystic fibrosis (C/F) have a higher copper content, the determination of copper in nail samples cannot be used in order to differentiate between normal {{children and}} patients. Also higher mean copper concentrations were found in <b>finger</b> <b>nail</b> clippings in comparison with toe nails. This difference was significant for patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|R

The procedure was first described by Otto Boll in 1945. Since that time it has become the chemical of choice for chemical matrixectomies performed by podiatrists.

He was fifteen years younger than her, tubercular and an alcoholic, and was not expected to live long. However, he stopped drinking and lived until 1948. Odle was very thin and [...] "over six feet tall with waist-length hair wound around the outside of his head", which he never cut. He also rarely cut his <b>finger</b> <b>nails.</b> From 1917 until 1939, the couple spent their winters in Cornwall and their summers in London; and then stayed permanently in Cornwall until Odle’s death in 1948. She supported herself and her husband with freelance writing for periodicals for many years, as Alan made little money from his art.|$|E

2500|$|A crewmember {{of typical}} size {{requires}} approximately 5kg or 11.0231lb(total) of food, water, and oxygen per day {{to perform the}} standard activities on a space mission, and outputs a similar amount {{in the form of}} waste solids, waste liquids, and carbon dioxide. [...] The mass breakdown of these metabolic parameters is as follows: 0.84kg of oxygen, 0.62kg of food, and 3.52kg of water consumed, converted through the body's physiological processes to 0.11kg of solid wastes, 3.87kg of liquid wastes, and 1.00kg of carbon dioxide produced. These levels can vary due to activity level, specific to mission assignment, but will correlate to the principles of mass balance. Actual water use during space missions is typically double the specified values mainly due to non-biological use (i.e.personal cleanliness). Additionally, the volume and variety of waste products varies with mission duration to include hair, <b>finger</b> <b>nails,</b> skin flaking, and other biological wastes in missions exceeding one week in length. Other environmental considerations such as radiation, gravity, noise, vibration, and lighting also factor into human physiological response in space, though not with the more immediate effect that the metabolic parameters have.|$|E

30|$|The {{position}} of the fingertip (x_f(t)) was calculated based on a triangulation method using two encoders (RE- 30 E- 500 - 213 - 1, NIDEC COPAL ELECTRONICS Corp., Japan, resultant position resolution: 0.010  mm) which were connected by a string taped to the subject’s <b>finger</b> <b>nail.</b> Each encoder was installed on a pillar set left or right side the vibrotactile display such that these two encoders and fingertip were aligned. The string was tensioned by a weight at each side and was wound by the encoders by way of pulleys.

40|$|Thirty-three {{individuals}} with {{various forms of}} onychomycosis aged 21 to 63 years, were under study. The analysis of microcirculation and regional blood flow with the ultrasonic dopplerography (DG) was performed before antifungal systemie therapy. The analysis demonstrated that 5 individuals (15. 2 %) showed the evidence of angiospasm, typical for Raynaud disease. Four individuals from this group exhibited both total onychomycosis and concomitant toe and <b>finger</b> <b>nail</b> involvement. Strong correlation between Raynaud disease and <b>finger</b> <b>nail</b> involvement as well as total form of onychomycosis {{was found in the}} present study. The results warrant the need of microcirculation and regional blood flow study as onychomycosis is connec-ted with vascular changes.
