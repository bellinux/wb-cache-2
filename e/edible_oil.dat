40|$|AbstractOxidative {{stability}} {{is one of}} the most important indicators for maintaining the quality of <b>edible</b> <b>oils.</b> 1 H NMR fingerprinting is used to evaluate the stability of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> at room temperature. The assignments of the 1 H NMR signals of the major and minor components of unoxidized <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> and the oil stability prediction were given. Minor components of the oils are playing an essential role in defining oil authenticity and quality. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) showed β-sitosterol, whereas, moringa oil (MO) showed β-sitosterol and stigmasterol. MO showed nonglyceride fraction, aliphatic chains and olefins. Sunflower oil (SO) could be easily distinguished due to its high linoleic acid content followed by apricot kernel oil (AKO). The order of stability of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> under study was: MO>EVOO>AKO>SO. 1 H NMR spectral data agreed with the results obtained from Rancimat method for the determination of oxidative stability of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> under study. The main advantages of this method are the short time of analysis, the possibility to analyze samples without any preliminary treatment, and the small quantity of sample required...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of the volatile compounds from <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> is a tool used {{for the evaluation of}} aroma compounds, the quantitative determination of contaminants or the study of oil degradation and represents a major analytical challenge. This review deals with the recent evolution of methods for vapor phase sampling of the headspace of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> combined with gas chromatography. Non-selective sampling methods, such as static headspace (SHS), sampling techniques with adsorbents, including direct thermal desorption (DTD) and dynamic headspace (DHS), and high concentration capacity headspace techniques (HCC-HS), as headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE), are presented. Advantages, drawbacks, and applications to <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> are critically discussed. HS-SPME is shown to be the most popular technique for the volatile fraction sampling of <b>edible</b> <b>oils.</b> Finally, other promising in-tube sorptive extraction techniques that are not yet applied to <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> are also described. Practical applications: The {{analysis of}} the volatile compounds from <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> is a major analytical challenge and is applied in many fields. An overview of different sampling techniques with a critical point of view can be useful to determine the best technique to apply in a specific context. The composition of the headspace of <b>edible</b> <b>oils</b> can provide different information related to the evaluation of aroma compounds, the quantitative determination of contaminants, or the study of oil degradation. Several techniques can be considered to respond to this challenge with different advantages and drawbacks, such as static headspace, solid phase microextraction, dynamic headspace, or headspace sorptive extraction...|$|R
