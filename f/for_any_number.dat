5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus the lucrative procuratorship <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, {{may have been in}} some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E
5|$|In {{parliamentary}} elections, 14-member election lists may {{be submitted}} to the State Electoral Commission <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of constituencies in Croatia. A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported {{by one or more}} political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|This {{may have}} been <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on slate, and then {{transfer}} just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the Madras Presidency at the time. He was also quite {{likely to have been}} influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

25|$|Green recursively {{constructs}} machines <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> {{of states}} and provides the recursive function that computes their score (computes σ), thus providing a lower bound for Σ. This function's growth is {{comparable to that of}} Ackermann's function.|$|E
25|$|Six-ball Westbury:Another game <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of people. Each {{player has}} one hand of 6 balls at a full frame. If all nine pins are knocked down within the hand, {{then they are}} reset, meaning that a player may score {{anywhere}} between 0 and 54. The winner is the player with the highest score. It is similar to killer {{in that it is}} usually played for money with the winner taking the pot.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of the shophouse is the use of a variety of open-to-sky spaces to admit natural daylight as well as natural air. These open-to-sky spaces may be back yards, small airwells and most commonly, internal courtyards. Depending on their size, these courtyards may be landscaped spaces for quiet reflection, places to dry laundry, vents for cooking fumes or toilet odours or spaces <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of household activities.|$|E

25|$|The Globe {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of being a progressive institution, and especially on social issues. We are pro-choice; we're against the death penalty; we're for gay rights. But if people read us carefully, they will find that on a whole series of other issues, we are not knee-jerk. We're for charter schools; we're <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of business-backed tax breaks. We are a lot more nuanced and subtle than that liberal stereotype does justice to.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, {{there was}} a {{potential}} crisis at Lord's when the Eyre Estate decided to sell the freehold at public auction. Dark was among many who urged MCC to bid but, <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of reasons including a lack of vision, they did not and the ground was bought by Isaac Moses, a property speculator, for £7000. Dark resigned the leasehold in 1864 and it {{was taken over by}} MCC. In 1866, using funds advanced by William Nicholson, MCC did buy the freehold from Moses for £18,333 6s 8d, which was not good business: they should have heeded James Dark.|$|E
25|$|Killer or German {{skittles}}: A game <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of people. Each {{starts with}} 3 lives. Each bowls only one ball at a time. The first bowls at a full frame and the skittles are not stuck up until all nine are hit down. Each time a player fails {{to hit a}} single pin (but they can hit as many as they like), he or she loses a life. The winner is the last one left with a life intact. Usually played for money, e.g. £1 or 50p a game each player - the winner takes the pot. Found in the Somerset and Bristol areas.|$|E

25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E
25|$|The DAC {{report is}} as {{critical}} to the livelihood of a professional truck driver as the credit report is to a consumer. When a trucking company reports negative information about a truck driver, it can ruin the driver’s career by preventing him or her from finding a truck driving job for several years or more. It is widely known that trucking companies often abuse this power by willfully and maliciously reporting false information on truckers’ DAC reports, either in retaliation for seeking better paying trucking jobs elsewhere or <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of other fraudulent, anti-competitive reasons. As long as truck drivers can be threatened with a false DAC report for standing up to management or leaving their company for a better job elsewhere, working conditions at truck driver jobs will not improve.|$|E
25|$|That is, the {{partition}} of vertices among the different colors is as uniform as possible. For instance, giving each vertex a distinct color would be equitable, but would typically use many more colors than are necessary in an optimal equitable coloring. An equivalent way of defining an equitable coloring {{is that it is}} an embedding of the given graph as a subgraph of a Turán graph with the same set of vertices. There are two kinds of chromatic number associated with equitable coloring. The equitable chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest number k such that G has an equitable coloring with k colors. But G might not have equitable colorings for some larger numbers of colors; the equitable chromatic threshold of G is the smallest k such that G has equitable colorings <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of colors {{greater than or equal to}} k.|$|E

25|$|Using a {{published}} table or computer {{which gives the}} percentage of these combined resources remaining <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of overs (or, more accurately, balls) left and wickets lost, the target score can be adjusted up or down to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times. The two teams' resource percentages are found, and used to calculate a 'par score' for the second team that is usually a fractional number of runs. The target score is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to tie (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If the second team reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when the second team has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If the second team fail to reach the par score then they have lost.|$|E
