5|$|Wright was {{defeated}} for {{election to the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, but was successful in 1852. Defeated <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> in 1854, he ran in 1860 as a Democrat with Republican support, and was elected to represent Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district. He spoke against the Peace Democrats early in the Civil War, but by 1864, believing the Union war aims had changed for the worse, he supported Democrat George B. McClellan for the presidency. Wright did not run <b>for</b> <b>reelection,</b> returning to private life in 1863. He continued his legal career, and published writings {{on the relationship between}} labor and capital. His book A Practical Treatise on Labor was published in 1871.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1820s Jennings was {{critically}} short of cash. He depended on income from political office {{to pay his}} expenses. His farm was not likely to provide sufficient financial support. Because the thirty-eight-year-old Jennings was prohibited by law from running <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> to a third term as Indiana governor in 1823, {{he was forced to}} consider other political options. Jennings decided to return to Congress.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

King received the most votes at 312, and White came in second with 288 votes, thus qualifying him for a seat. White ran <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> in 1811 against Alexander King, William Armstrong, and Jonathan Pugh. White and King received the two highest vote totals, with White receiving 313 votes. White was reelected to his seat in 1812, with 336 votes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the {{relationship}} between Glenn and Metzenbaum was strained. There was a thaw in 1983 (when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president) and in 1988 when Metzenbaum was opposed <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> by Cleveland mayor George Voinovich. Metzenbaum won, 57 to 41 percent. In his 1980 reelection campaign, Glenn won by the largest margin ever for an Ohio Senator, defeating U.S. Representative Tom Kindness in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, {{it appeared that}} Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on {{his work in the}} Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio {{from his}} native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise {{in the debate over}} whether all of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated <b>for</b> <b>reelection,</b> but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run <b>for</b> <b>reelection,</b> and died in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid <b>for</b> <b>reelection.</b> Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Specter {{became the}} Republican nominee for Senate when Republican {{incumbent}} Richard Schweiker announced his retirement. He faced the former Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pete Flaherty.

Specter ran <b>for</b> <b>reelection</b> in 2010, {{for the first time}} as a Democrat, but was defeated in the Primary.|$|E
