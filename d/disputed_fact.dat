25|$|In a {{class action}} lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16, 2013, Uber drivers plead that they were {{employees}} who had been misclassified as independent contractors {{in violation of the}} California Labor Code and demanded that they be given any tips Uber had collected on their behalf and payment of business expenses such as gas and maintenance of their vehicles. The District Judge, Edward M. Chen, ruled in the plaintiffs' favor with respect to a motion for summary judgement by defendants on March 11, 2015, holding that whether Uber drivers were employees was a <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> to be resolved by the jury. On September 1, 2015, Chen certified the class but generally limited it to drivers in California hired before June 2014 (when an opt-out arbitration clause was included in the contract) who had directly contracted with Uber.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms of grisi siknis vary, {{but there}} is a {{distinct}} set of central characteristics. Most of the victims are young girls from 15 to 18 years old. The attacks are prefaced by headaches, dizziness, anxiety, nausea, irrational anger and/or fear. During the attack, the [...] "victim loses consciousness" [...] and falls to the ground, subsequently running away, which running Dennis calls [...] "perhaps the most distinctive defining characteristic of grisi siknis behavior". The victim may view other people as devils, feel no pain for bodily injuries and have absolute amnesia regarding their physical circumstances. Some grab machetes or broken bottles to wave off unseen assailants. Other victims are reported to have performed superhuman feats, vomited strange objects such as spiders, hair and coins [...] and spoken in tongues. In some cases the semi-conscious victim will speak the names of the next to be infected, although it is not always accurate. It is still highly contagious. During attacks, victims report mental visions in which devils or evil spirits come for them, and have sex with them. These visions also include anything from horrifying nightmares to pleasant experiences, and many anthropologists claim these are sexual experiences. [...] This is a <b>disputed</b> <b>fact,</b> as not all cases involve sexual encounters. Attacks occur anywhere from multiple times a day to rarely when one is infected with grisi siknis. A person typically remains with the disease for several months to a year without medical attention, although some cases have been documented to recur for much longer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court found}} that a {{qualification}} was necessary to the general rule regarding final interdicts in motion proceedings. Sometimes the denial by the respondent of a fact alleged by the applicant may not be such as to raise a real, genuine or bona fide dispute of fact. If the respondent {{in such a case}} has failed to apply for the deponents concerned to be called for cross-examination, and if the court is satisfied as to the inherent credibility of the applicant's averments, the court may decide the <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> in the applicant's favour, without hearing oral evidence. This {{has come to be known}} as the [...] "Plascon-Evans rule." [...] When factual disputes arise, therefore, relief should be granted only if the facts stated by the respondent, together with the admitted facts in the applicant's affidavits, justify the order. The court noted there may be exceptions to this general rule, as where the allegations or denials are so far-fetched that the court is justified in rejecting them on the papers.|$|E
