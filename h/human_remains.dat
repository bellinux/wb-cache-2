5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> {{and that they were}} being DNA-tested to determine whether they belonged to his daughter. Final results revealed that the <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating of the <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> {{suggested}} that some {{were brought to}} the site between either 3980–3800 calibrated BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further {{suggested that}} after an interval of either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional depositions of <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).|$|E
5|$|Unlike many archaeological finds, the <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> at {{the site}} were able to be dated with environmental, geological, and archaeological methods. <b>Human</b> <b>remains</b> {{at the site}} are the oldest {{that have been found}} in Washington, and at the time were the oldest set of remains found in North America. Later {{radiocarbon}} work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these <b>human</b> <b>remains,</b> albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World. This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.|$|E

5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to an extent {{that it was not}} {{possible}} to determine if the scattered <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> of at least four people belonged to one burial or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

5|$|In June 2006, erosion {{resulting}} from heavy rains exposed <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> near the westbound lanes of Route 37 in Cranston. Subsequent drainage {{improvements to the}} freeway led {{to the discovery of}} <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> from more than 70 individuals buried in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Archaeological research indicated that the portion of Route 37 in Cranston between Exits 2 and 3 was inadvertently constructed over a portion of the State Farm Cemetery in the 1960s. The cemetery's wooden burial markers had deteriorated by the time Route 37 was constructed, and environmental studies that would have indicated the location of the cemetery were not conducted prior to the expressway's construction. In late 2006, the remains of 71 individuals were exhumed from the site of the previous cemetery and re-interred at the State Institution Cemetery in Warwick. On July 14, 2009, RIDOT hosted a memorial service for the 71 people re-interred in Warwick.|$|E

Traces of the abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small oval window was incorporated into the new building.

5|$|The {{location}} {{selected for}} the barrow had witnessed inhabitation during the preceding Mesolithic period, as evidenced by a nearby hearth and scatters of knapped flint tools. Built out of earth and local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> were deposited, alongside sherds of pottery vessels.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the chamber}} were placed <b>human</b> <b>remains,</b> {{which have been}} {{discovered}} and removed at intervals during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries.

Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.|$|E
5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which <b>human</b> <b>remains</b> might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
