25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, in the <b>drawing</b> <b>section</b> reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This {{is done by}} {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Health Professions, Dept. of Communication Sciences and DisordersThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a scoring rubric developed by the investigator could differentiate scores on the Drawing Assessment Protocol (DAP) (Alarcon, 2007) for persons with aphasia and for persons with no history of the specific language disorder. From these scores, the study also sought to explore whether adults with aphasia perform differently on the DAP compared to adults with no history of acquired brain injury. Additionally, the study was designed to investigate possible performance correlations between how adults with aphasia perform on DAP and to the <b>drawing</b> <b>section</b> of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) (Kertesz, 2006). Eight dyads containing six adults with aphasia and their communication partners as well as two dyads with no history of aphasia participated in the study. The two dyads with no history of aphasia were age and gender matched with two dyads in the aphasia group. The investigator obtained data from the administration of the <b>drawing</b> <b>section</b> of the WAB-R and DAP. The investigator rated the DAP drawings on the following measures: clarity, completeness, recognizability, and willingness to draw based the scoring rubric designed for this study. Scoring differentiation trends between the aphasia group and typical group indicated that the suggested rubric may be a beneficial scoring tool for the DAP. Parallels in scores between the WAB-R and DAP further supports this indication. Findings from this study warrant the use of the DAP and rubric with a larger pool of participants with aphasia in both research and clinical settings. Revisions to the recognizability measure should be made to help further differentiate scores along that measure...|$|E
