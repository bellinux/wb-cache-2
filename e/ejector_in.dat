50|$|An {{extractor}} also {{performs the}} function of an <b>ejector</b> <b>in</b> revolvers. When the striking force applied to the ejector rod is hard and fast enough, the extractor will typically eject the empty case(s) from the cylinder.

The 3" [...] barrel length variant of the Cloverleaf had the <b>ejector</b> <b>in</b> the same axis of the cylinder center pin and, thus, the cylinder needed {{to be removed from}} the frame when loading.|$|E
40|$|The ejector {{efficiencies}} {{affect the}} ejector expansion systems significantly. This paper provides a literature review on <b>ejector</b> efficiency <b>in</b> various <b>ejector</b> systems, such as refrigeration and heat pump systems (transcritical systems and subcritical systems), solar systems, and steam systems. The definitions of ejector efficiency and <b>ejector</b> component efficiencies <b>in</b> literature are summarized. The assumed constant ejector component efficiencies used <b>in</b> <b>ejector</b> modeling, and the empirical correlations of ejector efficiencies derived based on measured data are summarized and compared; {{the methods of}} determining energy efficiencies are summarized. The effects of ejector geometries, operation conditions and working fluid characteristics (single phase or two-phase, zeotropic or azeotropic) on ejector efficiencies are discussed. The prospects of <b>ejector</b> application <b>in</b> and beyond the field of refrigeration are also discussed. The potential of <b>ejector</b> used <b>in</b> the low-pressure working fluids ejector systems are discussed based on variation of ejector efficiencies.

A jet sheet surrounding the periphery of a widely diverging diffuser prevents separation and forms a gaseous, curved surface to provide effective diffuser ratio and additional length for mixing of primary and induced flows. Three-dimensional potential flow methods achieved a large reduction in {{the length of the}} associated solid surface; primary nozzle design further reduced the volume required by the jet-diffuser <b>ejectors,</b> resulting <b>in</b> thrust augmentation in excess of two, and an overall length of about 2 1 / 2 times the throat width...|$|R

50|$|Because the Deutsche Bundesbahn had {{sufficient}} goods train locomotives, they could quickly phase out the DRB Class 52 engines, {{so that the}} ageing boilers on the Class 50s could be replaced by those of the Class 52s.

40|$|Tests to {{determine}} the flow disturbances effects of four <b>ejectors</b> located <b>in</b> the corners just downstream of the diffuser in the Calspan wind tunnel are described. The flow quality in the nonejector mode is employed as the base-line configuration, and operating parameters are compared with data from other wind tunnels. During tests with the ejectors working, fluctuation levels increased between Mach 0. 4 - 0. 6, while temperature and vorticity levels remained constant. The ejector exhibited broad spectrum noise typical of free jet noise, yet static pressure measurements revealed only {{a slight increase in}} the broadband rms levels with the ejectors on, indicating negligible disturbances upstream caused by the ejectors. Choking the diffuser eliminated the jet noise, and the use of <b>ejectors</b> <b>in</b> the Mach range considered is concluded to cause no significant degradation in the Calspan tunnel flow quality...|$|R
5000|$|In the film, {{exposure}} to the AllSpark can repair Transformers (as shown when it heals Frenzy during the film) and convert Earthly machines into feral Cybertronians. A Nokia N93i cell phone, a Mountain Dew vending machine (named [...] "Dispensor" [...] in the Robot Heroes toy line), the airbag compartment in a sport utility vehicle's steering wheel, and an Xbox 360 are all shown being converted in this way. The cell phone robot is destroyed following the demonstration, but the fates of the other feral Transformers remain unknown and it is presumed they have been dealt with.

5000|$|The {{original}} Model 70 quickly {{established an}} excellent reputation with American sportsmen. It was a high-quality action of considerable strength, with 2 forward locking lugs and a Mauser-type non-rotating claw extractor. The key {{benefit of the}} Mauser-type extractor compared to later versions is that it captures the rim of a cartridge as it is fed upwards from the magazine and controls its journey forward into the rifle's chamber. This feed is called [...] "controlled round feeding" [...] (CRF) and is favored {{by a number of}} shooters who prefer rifles to feed reliably, especially those who pursue dangerous game. The ejector was of the blade type {{similar to that of the}} Mauser 98, but considered superior as it did not require a Mauser-type slot through the left locking lug; instead there was a slot in the bolt face below the locking lug, leaving both forward lugs solid and hence stronger. The main benefit of the blade type ejector is it is simpler and perhaps more reliable (being considered less susceptible to ingress of foreign matter) when compared to the later post-1964 plunger <b>ejector</b> <b>in</b> the bolt face controlled by a coil spring.|$|E
50|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the <b>ejector</b> <b>in</b> semi and fully automatic firearms.

The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.Cartridges are also routinely examined for fingerprints as the act of loading the ammunition into the magazine, or chamber, leaves recoverable impressions. These fingerprints can survive the firing processes and, while a rare occurrence, fingerprints have been obtained from cartridges recovered from the scene. Cartridges are subjected to cyanoacrylate fuming and examined for any usable prints. Usable prints are photographed and can be uploaded to fingerprint databases such as IAFIS for comparison with known exemplars. Cartridges can also be swabbed for trace DNA left by the individual who loaded the magazine. The extremely low levels of recoverable DNA present the same issues as swabbing a firearm for DNA.|$|E

The present work deals with the experimental analyses of these plume characteristics and includes the effects of nozzle aspect ratio and flow conditions (jet Mach number and temperature) on the plume decay and spreading of two-dimensional nozzles.

40|$|Ejector {{systems have}} been a field of {{research}} for many years. One of the latest topics are transcritical cycles with R 744 refrigerant. The main reason of installing <b>ejectors</b> <b>in</b> that type of systems is the recovering of the pressure energy, lost in the classic cycles during the throttling processes. The thesis consists basically of two parts, which both of consider the topic of parallel <b>ejector</b> operation. <b>In</b> the third part conclusions are presented. The first part is a simplified feasibility study for a concept R 744 cycle with three different <b>ejector</b> geometries working <b>in</b> parallel. MS Excel spreadsheet was created for general parameters calculations and for specific motive nozzles mass flow estimations. The second part contains results of measurement procedures on the SINTEF test facility. First, single ejector operation was examined. Basing on the test results, characteristic of P 2 GGC ejector geometry has been created. Later on, a new module with two different geometries (P 2 GGC and A 2 CDC) working in parallel has been built on the rig. The parallel ejector operation has been examined, as well as single operation of each geometry. The results has been compared, considering the influence of each operation on the system parameters. In the third part final conclusions are presented. Some ideas of further work are mentioned as well. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{abrasive}} {{effect of}} the creping blade {{the surface of the}} yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years)cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a metallisation, i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7-1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years.The thermal conductivity of the metallisation is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain thorugh thickness decrease some conductivity which is then again lost with the metallisation. Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (<b>ejector).</b> <b>In</b> the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. [...] "straw pipes" [...] or [...] "straws") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked ba means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the condensate (separator). The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee.In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses motive steam (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee.|$|E

Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|R
