40|$|Zero tillage {{along with}} {{application}} of mulch {{is an important}} strategy for soil conservation which maintains sustainability of agricultural system. A randomized complete block design in a split plot arrangement was used with four tillage methods [conventional tillage, (CT); deep tillage, (DT); zero tillage with zone <b>disc</b> <b>tiller,</b> (ZDT); and happy seeder, (HS) ] in main plots and five mulch materials [no mulch, (M 0); rice straw, (MRice); wheat straw, (MWheat); plastic sheet, (MPlastic) at 4 t ha- 1, and natural mulch, (MNatural) ] in subplots during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11. Results showed that DT significantly decreased soil bulk density, penetration resistance, and volumetric moisture content when compared with CT, ZDT, and HS. However, wheat yield parameters such as germination count, fertile tillers, grain yield and water use efficiency were significantly higher in HS compared with other tillage treatments while root length and grain protein were higher in DT. Plant height remained non-significant during 2009 - 10, while in 2010 - 11 it differed significantly and was higher in HS than other tillage treatments. Wheat yield parameters were significantly higher in MPlastic at 4 t ha- 1 than other mulch materials. Happy seeder and deep tillage along with plastic mulch have positive impact on soil physical properties, root growth, water use efficiency and yield parameters by creating a favorable soil environment...|$|E
40|$|Wheat {{is a major}} {{staple food}} of Pakistan, which not only {{provides}} the food for human but also has {{an important role in}} livestock feeds. It provides the raw material to various agro-based industries. Average wheat yield of the country is 2. 7 metric t ha- 1 (Govt. of Pakistan, 2010 - 11). Conventional methods of planting, late planting, poor management practices and imbalanced nutrient management are the major constraints of low yield in wheat production at farmer’s field. Zero tillage technology is considered more convenient and efficient planting system as it saves irrigation water, cost of inputs and increased the net income. Pakistani soils pH is high and productive without any major problem for crop husbandry. It is medium in K 2 O and deficient in N, P 2 O 5 and organic matter. Research was conducted at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, to evaluate the different tillage systems along with nitrogen levels and mulch materials regarding yield, growth, soil physical properties and grain quality. The aim of experiment was to determine the most favorable tillage system along with the best nitrogen level and mulch material. Two studies were carried out during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11. First study comprised of four tillage systems; conventional tillage, deep tillage, zero tillage sowing with zone <b>disc</b> <b>tiller</b> and zero tillage sowing with happy seeder along with four nitrogen levels i-e 75 kg ha- 1, 100 kg ha- 1, 125 kg ha- 1 and 150 kg ha- 1 along with control. The study- 2 comprised of same tillage systems along with four mulch materials i-e rice straw, wheat straw, plastic sheet @ 4 t ha- 1, natural mulch along with no mulch. Split plot design with three replications having net plot size 8. 0 m x 5. 4 m. Wheat variety Sehar- 2006 was sown 22. 5 cm apart with seed rate of 125 kg ha- 1 having 24 rows per plot. Data pertaining to growth, yield, soil physical properties and grain quality were noted by using standard procedures. Data collected from both experiments were statistically analyzed by MSTATC and the differences among the treatment means were compared for significance by using the Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test at 5...|$|E

It has been determined that tillering soil with the Wil-Rich disc harrow at 10 - 12 cm depth is less effective than fall ploughing with a top layer turning-over, chisel and <b>disc</b> <b>tillering</b> combined with summer herbicide treatment. The latter give the advantage of less weeds and higher grain yiel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Conservation {{agriculture}} {{is a concept}} for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving the environment. Conservation {{agriculture is}} based on enhancing natural biological processes {{above and below the}} ground. Interventions such as mechanical soil tillage are reduced to an absolute minimum, and the use of external inputs such as agrochemicals and nutrients of mineral or organic origin are applied at an optimum level and in a way and quantity that does not interfere with, or disrupt, the biological processes. CA is characterized by two principles, which are linked to each other. It is continuous minimum mechanical soil disturbance and permanent organic soil cover. Conservation tillage (agriculture) technologies where ploughing by a moldboard plough is replaced by tillers and shallow soil loosening in increasingly used as a soil treatment. It is typical for shallow soil tillage that all plant residues are left on the soil surface, or in the tilled upper soil layer. The plant residues can play very important role by next plant cultivation. The shovel and <b>discs</b> <b>tillers</b> are possible to use to advantage in conventional soil tillage systems and also by using conservation soil tillage technologies where is ploughing replaced by shallow tillage. In the experimental section the aim of research was described which is possible to summarize briefly as follows – the evaluation of soil physical properties on tillers work quality (especially on size of clods after soil treatment on the top and in the soil profile), evaluation of sweep <b>tillers</b> and <b>disc</b> <b>tillers</b> work quality by stubble ploughing. Key words: conservation soil tillage, consevation agriculture, sweep tiller...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} effect of different primary tillage methods on the CO 2 flux from soil and to evaluate the effect of conservation tillage tools on short-term CO 2 emissions. The {{experiments were}} conducted on a clay loam soil winter wheat field and a corn field. The three tillage treatments included stubble mulching (<b>disc</b> harrow, mulch <b>tiller,</b> chisel plough), primary tillage (disc harrow, moldboard plough, and chisel plough) and secondary tillage (combined seedbed maker). The control treatment was no-till with soil and residues left by the harvester. The CO 2 flux from the tilled soil surface was measured by a portable closed-chamber tester. Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing. Primary tillage caused higher CO 2 emission in the fall than seedbed preparation did in the spring. These results support increased use of new and improved forms of conservation tillage equipment and offer a significant potential for preserving or increasing soil C levels while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
