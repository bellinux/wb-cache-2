40|$|Abstract—Controlling {{the flow}} of {{materials}} inside job-shops involves several decisions such as the acceptance or rejection of an incoming order, the order’s due date definition, the releasing and the dispatching of the job. This study applies a multiple decision-making scheme involving these four decision phases to examine the sensitivity of job-shop performance to different order release parameters. The performance criteria of shop workload and order delivery were collected to demonstrate {{the influence of the}} most significant order release parameters: the queue workload limit and the planning parameter of the latest release date. The influence of each parameter is evaluated by computational simulations. The way we compute the machine workload limit affects not only the workload but also delivery performance measures. However, surprisingly, the latest release date has not a significant impact on shop-floor performance measures. The effect of the queue workload limit in an <b>input-output</b> <b>control</b> mechanism on delivery and workload related performance measures had not been studied up to date. Neither any analysis had investigated the influence of the latest release date calculus on the performance of the job-shop.

The diagnosis system is based on state estimators, namely dynamic observers or Kalman filters designed in deterministic and stochastic environment, respectively, and uses residual analysis and statistical tests for fault detection and isolation. The state estimators are obtained from input-output data process and standard identification techniques based on ARX or errors-in-variables models, depending on signal to noise ratio. In the latter case the Kalman filter parameters, i. e., the model parameters and input-output noise variances, are obtained by processing the noisy data according to the Frisch scheme rules.

In this paper a multiple decision-making scheme, with the purpose of planning and controlling operations and getting better delivery and workload related performance measures, as well as one order release decision rule are proposed. The decision-making scheme includes four main decisions: (i) accept or reject an in-coming order; (ii) define the order’s due date; (iii) release the accepted jobs; and (iv) dispatch the jobs at the station level. Extensive simulation experiments were performed to compare the proposed rule with the benchmark mechanisms, as well as with rules presented in previous studies. They led to the conclusion that considering the four decisions simultaneously can improve the job shop measures of performance, and that the proposed release rule is the best in almost all instances. job shop, <b>input-output</b> <b>control,</b> workload control, order release...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{modeling}} dynamic human control strategy (HCS) is becoming an increasingly popular paradigm {{in a number of}} different research areas, such as the intelligent vehicle highway system, virtual reality and robotics. Usually, these models are derived empirically, rather than analytically, from real human <b>input-output</b> <b>control</b> data. As such, there is a great need to develop adequate performance criteria for these models, as few guarantees exist about their theoretical performance.

We then model each individual 's control strategy through the flexible cascade neural network learning architecture. Next, we develop two performance measures for evaluating the resulting HCS models, one dealing with obstacle avoidance, the other with tight-turning behavior. Finally, we evaluate the relative skill of different HCS models through the proposed performance criteria...|$|E

These methods enable faults to be isolated, in addition to being detected. Furthermore, the reliable detection and isolation of multiple faults has also been experimented. Applications studies range from industrial gas turbines and power plants (e. g. Pont sur le Sambre).

40|$|Work {{flows in}} a job-shop are {{determined}} {{not only by}} the release load and the time between release factors, but also by the number of accepted orders. There has been extensive research on workload and <b>input-output</b> <b>control</b> aiming at improving the performance of manufacturing operations in job-shops. This paper explores the idea of controlling the workload since the acceptance/rejection of orders stage. A new acceptance/rejection rule is proposed, and tests are conducted to study the sensitivity of job-shop performance to different order acceptance parameters, like the tolerance of the workload limit and the due date extension acceptance. It also evaluates the effect of the negotiation phase of the proposed acceptance rule on the job-shop performance using a simulation model of a generic random job-shop. The extensive simulation experiments allow us to conclude that having a negotiation phase prior to rejection improves almost all workload performance measures. We also conclude that different tolerances of the workload limit affect slightly the performance of the job-shop. job shop, order negotiation, workload control...|$|E

Consequently, laboratories are often {{faced with the}} problem of developing experimental equipment that can support data recording with high temporal precision and also be flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of experimental paradigms. To this end, we have developed an architecture that integrates several modern pieces of equipment, but still grants experimenters a high degree of flexibility. Our hardware architecture and software tools take advantage of three popular and powerful technologies: the PLexon apparatus for neurophysiological recordings (Plexon, Inc., Dallas TX), a DAtapixx box (Vpixx Technologies, Saint-Bruno, QC, Canada) for analog, digital, and video signal <b>input-output</b> <b>control,</b> and the PSychtoolbox MATLAB toolbox for stimulus generation (Brainard, 1997). The PL-DA-PS (Platypus) system is designed to support the study of the visual systems of awake, behaving primates during multi-electrode neurophysiological recordings, but can be easily applied to other related domains.

40|$|SummaryThermosensors are {{ubiquitous}} integral membrane proteins {{found in}} all kinds of life. They are involved in many physiological roles, including membrane remodeling, chemotaxis, touch, and pain [1 – 3], but, the mechanism by which their transmembrane (TM) domains transmit temperature signals is largely unknown. The histidine kinase DesK from Bacillus subtilis is the paradigmatic example of a membrane-bound thermosensor suited to remodel membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below ∼ 30 °C [1, 4] providing, thus, a tractable system for investigating the mechanism of TM-mediated <b>input-output</b> <b>control</b> of thermal adaptation. Here we show that the multimembrane-spanning domain from DesK can be simplified into a chimerical single-membrane-spanning minimal sensor (MS) that fully retains, in vivo and in vitro, the sensing properties of the parental system. The MS N terminus contains three hydrophilic amino acids near the lipid-water interface creating an instability hot spot. Mutational analysis of this boundary-sensitive beacon revealed that membrane thickness controls the signaling state of the sensor by dictating the hydration level of the metastable hydrophilic spot. Guided by these results we biochemically demonstrated that the MS signal transmission activity is sensitive to bilayer thickness. Membrane thickness could be a general cue for sensing temperature in many organisms...|$|E
