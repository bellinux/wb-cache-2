5000|$|Photothermal optical {{microscopy}} / [...] "photothermal single particle microscopy" [...] {{is a technique}} {{that is based on}} detection of non-fluorescent labels. It relies on absorption properties of labels (gold nanoparticles, semiconductor nanocrystals, etc.), and can be realized on a conventional microscope using a resonant modulated <b>heating</b> <b>beam,</b> non-resonant probe beam and lock-in detection of photothermal signals from a single nanoparticle. It is the extension of the macroscopic photothermal spectroscopy to the nanoscopic domain. The high sensitivity and selectivity of photothermal microscopy allows even the detection of single molecules by their absorption. Similar to Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), the photothermal signal may be recorded with respect to time to study the diffusion and advection characteristics of absorbing nanoparticles in a solution. This technique is called photothermal correlation spectroscopy (PhoCS).|$|E

The domain of the data considered includes the Supershot, High poloidal beta, Low-mode, and limiter High-mode operational regimes, as well as discharges with a reversed magnetic shear configuration. The new important parameter in the present scaling is the peakedness of the <b>heating</b> <b>beam</b> fueling profile shape. Ion energy confinement and neutron production are relatively insensitive to other plasma parameters compared to the beam fueling peakedness parameter and the <b>heating</b> <b>beam</b> power when considering plasmas that are stable to magnetohydrodynamic modes. However, the stored energy of the electrons is independent of the beam fueling peakedness. The implication of the scalings based on this parameter is related to theoretical transport models such as radial electric field shear and Ion Temperature Gradient marginality models. Similar physics interpretation is provided for beam heated discharges on other major tokamaks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{demonstration}} of mirage effect {{under a microscope}} provides a new possibility to measure the thermal diffusivity of a transparent sample {{as small as a}} few microns, with micronic spatial resolution. Mirage effect [l] is now a classical technique of photothermal physics. The modulated <b>heating</b> <b>beam</b> is focused at normal incidence on the sample's surface, while the probe beam runs either along the surface (transverse configuration) or along the <b>heating</b> <b>beam</b> (collinear configu-ration, for transparent samples; cf. figure 1). The probe beam senses the modulated temperature gradient all along its path in the heated region, and is deviated accordingly. The characteristic lengths (beam waist diameters; thermal diffusion length in the sample) are usually of the order of one tenth of a millimetre. Mirage effect has been extensively used to study the transport of heat, of carriers, of mass, etc [...] . [2 - 41. The present work presents a {{demonstration of}} mirage effect under a microscope, with characteristic lengths one order of magnitude smaller (beam diameter = 8 pm; thermal diffusion length in the sample = 17 pm). The interest is precisely this reduction of the exploration scale. A stronger reduction could be achieved, in view of the good signallnoise ratio obtained here...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhotothermal {{deflection}} spectroscopy is used {{in order}} to investigate near- and sub-band gap absorption of Si-doped GaSb epilayers deposited by MBE on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. The optical absorption spectra show an extra absorption on the transparency region below the bandgap due to free-carrier absorption. However, for energies above the gap, we notice a linear behavior of the square root of the absorption coefficient versus the <b>heating</b> <b>beam</b> energy, which is attributed to phonon-assisted absorption. From interpolation of the phonon absorption to low energies we have determined the free-carrier absorption that is found to follow the Drude law...|$|E
