5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and <b>Disease</b> <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) remain {{the gold standard}} for determining evidence-based clinical practices, large <b>disease</b> <b>registries</b> that enroll large numbers of patients have become paramount as a relatively cost-effective additional tool. Methods: We highlight the advantages of <b>disease</b> <b>registries</b> focusing on the example of prostate cancer and the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE™) registry. Results: CaPSURE collects approximately 1, 000 clinical and patient-reported variables, in over 13, 000 men that are enrolled. Thus far, CaPSURE has yielded over 130 peer-reviewed publications, with several others in press, in key areas of risk migration, practice patterns, outcome prediction, and quality of life outcomes. Conclusions: <b>Disease</b> <b>registries,</b> like CaPSURE complement RCTs and CaPSURE, have provided a means to better understand many aspects of prostate cancer epidemiology, practice patterns, oncologic and HRQOL outcomes, and costs of care across populations. Specialized observational <b>disease</b> <b>registries</b> such as CaPSURE provide insight and have broad implications for disease management and policy. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

25|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} arsenic {{poisoning}} is possible. British anti-lewisite (dimercaprol) is prescribed in doses of 5mg/kg up to 300mg every 4hours {{for the first}} day, then every 6hours for the second day, and finally every 8hours for 8 additional days. However the USA's Agency for Toxic Substances and <b>Disease</b> <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR) states that {{the long-term effects of}} arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Long-term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.|$|E

25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and <b>Disease</b> <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR), eating food or {{drinking}} water contaminated {{with high levels}} of coal tar creosote may cause a burning in the mouth and throat, and stomach pains. ATSDR also states that brief direct contact with large amounts of coal tar creosote may result in a rash or severe irritation of the skin, chemical burns of the surfaces of the eyes, convulsions and mental confusion, kidney or liver problems, unconsciousness, and even death. Longer direct skin contact with low levels of creosote mixtures or their vapours can result in increased light sensitivity, damage to the cornea, and skin damage. Longer exposure to creosote vapours can cause irritation of the respiratory tract.|$|E

25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and <b>Disease</b> <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR) (2007), benzene {{is both an}} anthropogenically {{produced}} and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.|$|E
25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance <b>Disease</b> <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.

40|$|<b>Disease</b> <b>registries</b> have {{traditionally}} been vehicles for the collection of clinical data, in most instances following {{a large number of}} patients for a long time period in an observational manner, and enhancing our understanding of disease aetiology and epidemiology. However, over recent decades, the potential for additional data collection and analyses to be conducted within the framework of a registry has been recognised and utilised. This is evident by the sheer number of registries that are now referenced in the medical literature, covering a vast array of therapeutic areas and topics much more varied than incidence, prevalence and survival. The opportunity to collect QOL and pharmacoeconomic data has been utilised within the registry framework as more and more countries have increased their demands for such information for regulatory procedures, including pricing and reimbursement decisions. This increased need for information has led to a marked {{increase in the number of}} registries undertaken that are primarily sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. <b>Disease</b> <b>registries</b> offer tremendous opportunities to realise improvements in care.
