40|$|Abstract—The main {{objective}} of the present investigation is to study the environmental impact due to accidental spill of toxic and flammable liquefied natural gas (LNG) on land. Different case studies of possible accidents in Egypt were considered. US EPA-approved dispersion models were used to estimate the size and location of the formed <b>dangerous</b> <b>zones</b> at different elapsed times from the accident. The growth and decay of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>zones</b> for different concentration levels were also obtained showing them in downwind, crosswind, and vertical directions. In this study the toxicity of natural gas is measured by its concentration causing suffocation to humans while flammability is measure by its lowest concentration in air to cause fire {{in the presence of}} an ignition source. Two accidental scenarios of LNG spill from an instantaneous full rupture of a storage tank or a rupture of an external pipe connected to it have been considered. In both cases, constant area or constant thickness of the formed LNG pool were studied. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effects of wind speed, atmospheric stability, and vertical height on the size of formed <b>dangerous</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{directorate}} {{has defined}} a hazard mitigation map for Mount Tambora. Two zones are declared: the <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> and the cautious zone. The <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> {{is an area}} that would be affected directly by an eruption: pyroclastic flow, lava flow and other pyroclastic falls. This area, including the caldera and its surroundings, covers up to 58.7 km2. Habitation of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> is prohibited. The cautious zone includes areas that might be indirectly affected by an eruption: lahar flows and other pumice stones. The size of the cautious area is 185 km2, and includes Pasanggrahan, Doro Peti, Rao, Labuan Kenanga, Gubu Ponda, Kawindana Toi and Hoddo villages. The river Guwu at the southern and northwest part of the mountain is also included in the cautious zone.|$|E

To defeat the threat, British escorts will meet American transports before they enter the most <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone.</b> The rendezvous point will not {{be given to the}} ships until the day before they meet, transmitted by wireless in a new code devised by Major Brennan. An ammunition ship is sent first to test the new system. However a German spy ring in the city has already gained access to the code and allows the ship through to lure more valuable troop transports into their U-boat trap. Gordon deciphers the intercepted message and realizing that the code has been compromised, alerts his superiors. A troop convoy has already sailed for France and in three days they will have to send it the rendezvous location in the no longer secret code.|$|E
40|$|From {{traffic safety}} {{research}} {{in the province of}} noord-brabant it is shown that in this province more accidents in which only one vehicle was involved occur than in the other provinces. In these accidents the vehicle involved overturned, landed in water, collided against an obstacle or against a parked vehicle. The accident analyses, made for this report, were focused on crash measures. These are measures for decreasing the severity of accidents. Furthermore some pre-crash measures for preventing accidents are analysed. The road administrator can study by means of these analyses which crash measures are indicated on selected problem locations in the short term. <b>Dangerous</b> <b>zones</b> must be removed or relocated, obstacles should be constructed less dangerously and <b>dangerous</b> <b>zones</b> could be provided with safety fences or guardrail constructions.

50|$|California, Florida {{and several}} other states in the US, {{concerned}} with public safety and the danger posed by counterfeit and diverted medicines, issued pedigree laws requiring participants in the value chain to demonstrate and document the ownership and custody history of medicines. Forced to handle complex serialisation and data gathering and formatting requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturers kicked their efforts into high gear spurring innovation in the industry. SAP responded with additional investment {{in the area that}} rendered a full solution for serialisation and track and trace which was rapidly adopted by leaders like Novartis, Cephalon, Roche, and many others. In addition, in 2007 SAP unveiled its Auto-ID Enterprise offering which allows companies to manage serialised data and events at the enterprise level and also at manufacturing, distribution, or retail nodes. The solution is compliant with the EPCGlobal’s EPCIS standard and provides a platform for enabling cross company collaborative applications like ePedigree, recall and deduction management, and product tracking and authentication.The US Department of Defense (DoD) has also seen the advantages that new technologies could bring to its own supply chain and maintenance operations. In 2005 the DoD issued serialisation and Auto-ID requirements -iUID program- covering many of its 43,000 suppliers. SAP quickly grasped the requirements and created a solution for its customers, such as Pratt and Whitney.Several other companies reaped the rewards offered by Real-World Aware technologies in other areas: chemical manufacturer BASF had deployed SAP Event Management to monitor ocean shipments - especially through unplanned events - and gain visibility and responsiveness in its transportation processes. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, BASF was able to quickly redirect in-transit shipments to safe ports and suffered minor disruption in its operations. British Petroleum worked with SAP Research to use a self-aware wireless mesh sensor network to prevent in real-time storage of dangerous combinations of chemical substances in the same facility. BP and SAP also worked in using RFID to enforce environmental, health and safety directives, for example automating real-time verification that a worker has taken the appropriate training and is wearing the mandatory equipment while working in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone.</b> On another project, SAP installed a “proof-of-presence” solution for Frankfurt Airport to ensure that the worker in charge of maintaining hard-to-reach assets was in fact physically present doing the work. Airbus and SAP worked together creating a solution that used RFID to more effectively manage the tools loaned to airlines for the maintenance of their planes.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{definition}} of the safe and <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> for screw placement with Stoppa approach for rapid identification during operation and a new way for the studies on the “safe zone. ” Pelvic CT data of 84 human subjects were recruited to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3 D) models. The distances between {{the edges of the}} “safe zone,” “dangerous zone,” and specific anatomic landmarks such as the obturator canal and the pelvic brim were precisely measured, respectively. The results show that the absolute “dangerous zone” was from the pelvic brim to 3. 07 [*]cm below it and within 2. 86 [*]cm of the obturator canal, while the region 3. 56 [*]cm below the pelvic brim or 3. 85 [*]cm away from the obturator canal was the absolute “safe zone” for screw placement. The region between the absolute “safe zone” and the absolute “dangerous zone” was the relatively “dangerous zone. ” As a conclusion, application of computer-assisted 3 D modeling techniques aids in the precise measurement of “safe zone” and “dangerous zone” in combination with Stoppa incision. It was not recommended to place screws on the absolute <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone,</b> while, for the relatively “dangerous zone,” it depends on the individual variations in bony anatomy and the fracture type...|$|E
40|$|Accidental {{leakages}} of liquefied propane from high-pressure pipelines {{may occur}} despite {{the use of}} sophisticated safety equipment and following strict monitoring procedures. Environmental impact of steady and transient leakages were considered from toxicity and flammability viewpoints for two specific scenarios of full pipe ruptures. For each case, calculated mass flow rate, velocity, and temperature of leaking gas were utilized in an EPA-based dispersion model to predict the ground level concentration profiles in the downwind and crosswind directions. For the specific pipeline conditions considered here, the first scenario of a nonjet release {a cloud) produced steady toxic and flammable zones which were about 20 times bigger than those produced in the transient case. The second scenario of a free vertical jet resulted {{in the formation of}} a flammable vertical plume, while at ground level it did not produce flammable nor toxic zones. A parametric study of the first scenario confirmed the expected effects of both the gas release time and the atmospheric stability {{on the size of the}} dangerous zones. Within the typical range, the wind speed was found to have opposite effects for steady and transient releases. For a steady release, the <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> was wider for slower winds and vice versa for a transient case. Moreover, the size of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>zone</b> was found to be an exponen-tial function of the pipe diameter, while the effect of the initial pipe pressure was insignificant...|$|E
