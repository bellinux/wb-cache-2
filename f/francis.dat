5|$|Guitarist Joey Santiago and {{songwriter}} Black <b>Francis</b> (born Charles Thompson IV) met when they lived {{next to each}} other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed <b>Francis</b> played music and the pair began to jam together. <b>Francis</b> embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. <b>Francis</b> and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with <b>Francis</b> composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010 in Nashville, Thompson {{recorded}} an album of new songs written and performed with collaborator Reid Paley, as Paley & <b>Francis</b> (Reid Paley & Black <b>Francis).</b> The debut Paley & <b>Francis</b> album (also titled Paley & <b>Francis)</b> was produced by Jon Tiven, and features Reid Paley and Black <b>Francis</b> on guitars and vocals, accompanied by Muscle Shoals legends Spooner Oldham on piano and David Hood on bass. The album was released in October 2011 on Sonic Unyon in North America, and on Cooking Vinyl in the UK & Europe.|$|E

50|$|After <b>Francis's</b> death Leo took {{a leading}} {{part in the}} {{opposition}} to Elias of Cortona. It was Leo who broke in pieces the marble box which Elias had set up for offertories for {{the completion of the}} basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this outrage on St <b>Francis's</b> dearest disciple consolidated the opposition to Elias. Leo was the leader {{in the early stages of}} the struggle in the order for the maintenance of St <b>Francis's</b> ideas on strict poverty, and the chief inspirer of the tradition of the Spirituals on St <b>Francis's</b> life and teaching.|$|R

The casting would reunite her with several of her former General Hospital alumni, including Tristan Rogers, Stephen Nichols, Judith Chapman and Kin Shriner.

In Philadelphia, <b>Francis</b> attended The 2015 World Meeting of Families, coordinated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Pope <b>Francis</b> ended his first Papal {{visit to the}} U.S. by saying mass to a crowd of 1 million people on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. While in Philadelphia, <b>Francis</b> attended many events, including a speech to a crowd of 50,000 people at Independence Hall and a visit and blessing at Saint Joseph's University.|$|E
5|$|At night, <b>Francis</b> spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare {{sleeping}} in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. <b>Francis</b> also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. <b>Francis</b> and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. <b>Francis</b> follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E

While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.|$|E

5|$|George Luttrell died without children, and Dunster Castle {{passed to}} his brother <b>Francis,</b> who survived the {{political}} turmoil of both the Commonwealth years and the Restoration of Charles II to power in 1660. Francis' heir, another <b>Francis,</b> married a wealthy heiress worth £2,500 a year (£331,000 at 2009 prices) and with this income set about modernising the castle during the 1680s, in particular building a grand staircase in the latest style. <b>Francis</b> was a colonel in the local militia and in 1688 backed William of Orange's attempt to oust James II; when William landed in Devon, <b>Francis</b> mustered {{a number of companies}} of infantry at Dunster on 19 November to support him, which formed the basis for the later Green Howards regiment. During this period the castle still kept an armoury of 43 muskets. <b>Francis</b> died heavily in debt in 1690, and his widow Mary moved the contents of the castle to London, where they were destroyed in a fire in 1696.|$|E
