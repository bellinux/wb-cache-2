50|$|At {{the time}} of the birth of Christ, cults of men devoted to a goddess flourished {{throughout}} the broad region extending from the Mediterranean to south Asia. While galli were missionizing the Roman Empire, kalû, kurgarrû, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. To complete the picture we should also mention the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male “temple prostitutes” known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature documents gender variant shaman-priests throughout southeast Asia, Borneo, and Sulawesi. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of galli and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration.

This political shift resulted in San Francisco’s queer culture remerging in bars, nightclubs, and entertainment of the Barbary Coast, removed from policing and control. Through the 1890s to 1907, the Barbary Coast, San Francisco’s early red-light district located on Pacific Avenue, featured same-sex prostitution and female impersonators who served male clientele.|$|R
40|$|During {{her early}} {{career as a}} sculptor, the French artist Louise Bourgeois (1911 - 2010) experimented with various methods of {{representing}} the female body {{in a state of}} dismemberment or fragmentation. Despite the transgression latent within such sculptures, critics and scholars alike interpreted Bourgeois’s oeuvre from a psycho-biographical angle. In doing so, they suggested that her art was rooted in a personal—as opposed to political—consciousness. This thesis analyzes some of the reasons behind this common method of interpretation, looking specifically at the personal myth that Bourgeois promoted in order to gain acceptance in the art world. In addition, this work questions {{the ways in which the}} artist masked the <b>gendered</b> <b>transgression</b> in two sculptural self-portraits through unique adaptations to Modernist traditions...|$|R

This paper takes as it’s departure point the notion that alcohol plays a meaningful role in social lives and relationships. It is {{through the use of}} narrative that these young women make sense of their drinking, which is still stigmatised. Any harms encountered along the way tend to be filtered through the ‘good story’, brimming with tales of fun, adventure, bonding, sex, <b>gender</b> <b>transgressions</b> and relationships. Nevertheless, these women implemented their own practical harm minimisation strategies, and it is here that professionals can gain a foot hold and assist young people to drink more safely...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} doing gender has been critiqued by {{scholars}} who assert {{that it does}} not take human agency and acts of resistance into account. [...] In order to illustrate the possibility of change, several works have been published in which researchers claim to document an 'undoing' or 'redoing' of gender. Francine M. Deutsch, in [...] "Undoing Gender" [...] (2007), examines how the concept of doing gender has been employed in research. Deutsch uses examples of studies that use West and Zimmerman's work to illustrate how normative gender ideals are apparent in a variety of contexts. This, she argues, contributes to the invisibility of <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> and does not work towards West and Zimmerman's goal of eliminating gender inequity. In order to facilitate the undoing of gender, Deutsch suggests that [...] "The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered; (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions; (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality; (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change; and (5) interaction as the site of change" [...] (p. 114). By focusing on these areas, Deutsch asserts, it is easier to find practical solutions to problems cause by gender inequity.|$|E
40|$|Stemming from {{personal}} experience, the author focuses her thesis on as “a queer, white genderqueer” female. The author {{is interested in}} how other lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTW) young people talked about their own gender and <b>gender</b> <b>transgression.</b> <b>Gender</b> <b>transgression</b> refers to an act {{that is different from}} and defined by a set of gendered norms or expectations.

After attending a few groups at the Attic Youth Center, a youth center for LGBTQ youth in Philadelphia, the author pursued her research questions by spending time and participating in Attic activities. This thesis addresses the questions: In what ways does gender and <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> affect the daily lives and/or larger identity of youth at the Attic? How do youth define gender? How does gender intersect with and interact with the other identities youth negotiate during adolescence? When do youth talk about gender? How do they talk about it and what language do they use for talking about it? Methodology includes examination of existing theories and using multiple identity theories to frame conceptions of gender in her data. The author argues that gender and <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> are partially defined by a hetero-normative power structure, and that gender is one of the multiple identities that adolescents negotiate during adolescence...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} I analyzed early modern adaptations of four myths {{present in the}} Metamorphoses written by Publius Ovidius Naso (34 BC – AD 17). In the myths I have selected - the myth of Tiresias, Hermaphroditus and Salmacis, Iphis and Caenis/Caeneus - curious gender transformations take place, in which the characters transform into the opposite sex or into a hermaphrodite. I {{was interested in the}} discrepancy between the fictional world of Ovid and the ‘real’ world of early modern Europe in regards to <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> and wanted to know how these four myths are used, manipulated, depicted and/or censured in early modern translations and commentaries. Furthermore, I wanted to know if interpretations of these myths change over time and if they differ per Northern European country (England, the Dutch Republic, France and Germany). The early modern adaptations show that <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> was viewed with the utmost suspicion and are described as abormalities. <b>Gender</b> <b>transgression</b> distorted the social and natural order. This narrative is enforced by the use of explicit early modern notions of gender, which are emphasized in these translations and added to the original text. The myths are used to define and reinforce these distinctions, considering any deviation of these norms as abnormal. Specifically the fear of becoming feminine is emphasized, which is presented as being an abominable fate. The distinctions between men and women were so strong {{that it was impossible to}} overcome them, even if they are described in a fictional world...|$|E

We focus on two key themes: caring practices and relations and the divide between physical activity and intellectual pursuits. Drawing on these themes, we show how age allows for <b>gender</b> <b>transgressions</b> and practices of gender equality and how young boys and old men can also uphold a discourse of hegemonic masculinity, despite age-related tensions. We conclude by arguing that a consideration of age has much to offer in terms of thinking about how gender is socially constructed and illuminates the complex power relations of age and gender categories...|$|R

In the gender transformation task the Aravanis believed in the male to female transformation but not in the female to male transformation. I argue that the asymmetry in the Aravanis' responses suggests that their beliefs about gender are consistent with Hindu patriarchal beliefs that feminine gender is essential and primordial, whereas masculine gender transformations are viewed as part of the male prerogative. The marginalized gender experience of the Aravanis influenced their judgments about gender transgressions but not their beliefs about gender transformations.

Adopting a critical/reflexive methodology, it begins by examining how past {{research has been}} framed through the object of study of <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> (transness). It demonstrates that this focus has limited the scope of policies considered: which policies are discussed, what is said about them, {{and how they are}} evaluated. In order to move forward, the dissertation proposes the concept of policy encounters, that is, contact between policy users and policy. This notion is developed by examining trans people's encounters with housing, social assistance, refugee, and trans-specific policies (e. g. civil status). Based on 30 one-on-one interviews, this review expands the scope (breadth and depth) of what is considered in relation to trans people and policy, uncovers new points of evaluation, and re-examines political priorities. All in all, policy encounters offer a much better perspective of trans people's policy landscape than <b>gender</b> <b>transgression.</b> Finally, this dissertation highlights the skills and strategies adopted by trans people to navigate complex and imperfect policies. As a whole, the project moves towards offering policy advice to policy users...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) {{engagement}} with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and the Women, Peace and Security agenda military personnel have been tasked with engaging with and implementing NATO’s interpretation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, to do ‘gender work’ within the alliance.

This article analyses the experiences of two military men actively and consciously ‘doing’ this gender work. Using Duncanson’s (2015) notion of a (re) negotiation of gender relationships based upon empathy, similarity, interdependence, respect and equality, the accounts of these men are analysed, exploring ways in which a more ‘gender conscious’ militarised masculinity may develop. It is argued that positive, incremental shifts within militarised masculinities should not be dismissed; yet the process is contested, contradictory and incomplete. The article highlights how perceived <b>gender</b> <b>transgressions</b> are policed and controlled via trivialisation and feminisation and how conceptualisations of masculinist protection (Young 2003) and credibility, can reinforce pre-existing gender relations, rather than challenge or change them...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{conceptual}} framework for understanding the relationship between sexual dissidence, <b>gender</b> <b>transgression</b> and commercial hospitality. The paper aims to argue that this can be used to examine how ideological assumptions about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) consumers are mobilised in the production and consumption of hospitality spaces. Design/methodology/approach – The paper synthesises three theoretical strands: first, Turner’s concepts of the liminoid and communitas; second, anthropological and socio-political conceptions of myth and myth-making and third, Lefebvre’s spatial dialectic in the production of material, abstract and symbolic space. It is argued that, when considered together, these theoretical approaches help to understand the consumer experience, the ideological assumptions that underpin the experience, and the processes through which the experience is constructed. Findings – The holistic nature of the approach helps to analyse the relationship between consumption and community ideologies at the micro level of personal interaction, the meso level of group and organisational norms and the macro level of societal structures and agencies. Research limitations/implications – The application of this framework in empirical research can enhance our understanding of the role of commercial hospitality spaces in reproducing and challenging particular ideological assumptions about LGBT consumers. It can inform the operational strategies of commercial organisations. Furthermore, it can underpin a critical perspective on management, which encourages practitioners to develop a sense of social responsibility towards the communities of consumers they target. Originality/value – Applying this framework to empirical research will also help one to understand the nature of consumption and production within commercial hospitality...|$|E

As daughters and wives, they are neglected, abandoned or rejected by their families; they live alone, with their parents past the age that is their natal right, with siblings, or with families and men who {{are not related to}} them. I explore the circulation of their counternarratives and how their <b>gender</b> <b>transgressions</b> go public through ordinary forms of talk, such as gossip and rumor. I argue that their move out of the normative is not produced by, but produces, their gender politics; that their agency emerges cognitively from the telling of their stories in tandem with their interlocutors' credulity and uptake; and that the site of gender politics for working class Indian women lies in the informal subaltern publics that are formed by the circulation of their stories. Contrary to the notion of a stable unitary subject that precedes the political, these women's counternarratives demonstrate the subject‐in‐process as a political effect. Their alterity does not exist outside the heteronormative gender order but demarcates the boundaries of its historicity, hinting at both the internal contradictions of existing gender relations and their future possibilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{critique}} of the social construction of gender through examining its performative nature in terms of filmic representations which deviate from the expected gender norms. Focus groups were conducted on M. Butterfly (1993) and Orlando (1992) which were selected because they are recent examples of films which implicitly critique the social binary of gender. Some of the issues addressed {{in the course of the}} research include: the ways in which the "rules" of gender and the gender attribution process shape our interaction with others, the ways in which individuals interpret representations of gender which transgress normative gender and how this connects with social reality, how <b>gender</b> <b>transgressions</b> conflict with the gender attribution process, and how gender can be viewed as performance. The conclusions are formulated in terms of connecting the notion of the performative to both filmic and real life representations of gender, as well as in terms of future work to be done in this area. My principal conclusions are that the fluidity and multiplicity of gender identification are reaching the general public, as evidenced by my focus groups, both through the academic sources and the media; and furthermore that this public finds some sympathy for the rejection of the traditional binary and stereotypical model of gender, and instead look at gender in terms of a continuum...|$|R
