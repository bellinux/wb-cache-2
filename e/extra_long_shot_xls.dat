40|$|This thesis {{wants to}} explore <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> {{alongside}} with stylization in cinema. 	Through three directors are explored possibility and problematic of cinematographic expression through <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylization. Stylisation is connected mainly with mis-en-scène and particular {{aspects of it}} – acting, film decoration/props, film space, film sound, [...] . 	The terms stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> (plan-séquence) are analysed and explored on its own and in the films of the chosen directors. 	The main analysed directors are Andrei Tarkovsky, Carl Th. Dreyer and Béla Tarr and their three films (in the same order) - Sacrifice, Gertrud and Satantango. 	The chosen directors are {{from my point of}} view the best example of the use of stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> due to their artistic clarity and coherence. 	I try to base this work mostly on my own analysis and thoughts about <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylisation based on the literature, films and my own film works, although I also use quotations from directors/authors and quotations from theoretical works. 	The thesis in its form is closest to the analytic and essay study...|$|R
