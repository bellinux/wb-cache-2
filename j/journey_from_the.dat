5|$|On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese {{battalion}} and the {{two companies}} of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela. Exhausted by their <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Congo and suffering from dysentery {{and a lack of}} artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action. Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Saïo from the west, while British troops under General Alan Cunningham conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia. The Arbegnoch also threatened the Italian positions. In April, Italian forces burned the elephant grass along the Saïo Plateau to ensure an unobstructed field of fire. That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the Dabus River to link up with the rest of their unit to contain the Italian garrison in Mendi.|$|E
5|$|The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was an {{expedition}} to Antarctica which took place between 1910 and 1913. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott and had various scientific and geographical objectives. Scott wished to continue the scientific work that he had begun when leading the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic in 1901–04. He also {{wanted to be the}} first to reach the geographic South Pole. He and four companions attained the pole on 17 January 1912, where they found that the Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 34 days. Scott's entire party died on the return <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pole; some of their bodies, journals, and photographs were found by a search party eight months later.|$|E

5|$|There are no rail {{links to}} Keswick; the line {{built in the}} 1860s for the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway closed in 1972. Since the 1990s a plan to rebuild it has been under discussion. Some 90 percent of the {{earthworks}} of the railway still exist, but according to 2000 estimates, a reopening would cost £25million. In 2014 the only public transport serving the towns and villages on the old railway route is a bus service operating at mostly hourly intervals.

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy {{had taken}} his oath of fealty to the King, and had been {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to {{come down from the}} Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north back to London.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a sound effect of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The sound effect continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert's {{expedition}} to the Caribbean, was an unsuccessful operation by a French naval squadron to transport supplies to Guadeloupe in December 1809 {{at the height of}} the Napoleonic Wars. Over the previous year, British Royal Navy squadrons had isolated and defeated the French Caribbean colonies one by one, until by the autumn Guadeloupe was the only colony remaining in French hands. Cut off from the rest of the world by British blockade squadrons that intercepted all ships coming to or from the island, Guadeloupe was in a desperate situation, facing economic collapse, food shortages and social upheaval, as well as the impending threat of British invasion. In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony, the French government sent four vessels to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert. Two of the ships were 20-gun flûtes carrying supplies and troops. The two others were 40-gun frigates, ordered to protect the storeships on their <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British forces operating off both the French and Guadeloupe coasts.|$|E

5|$|The B-70, {{designed}} for even higher speeds, altitudes and range than the B-58, suffered {{even more in}} relative terms. At high altitudes, the B-70 was as much as four {{times as fast as}} the B-52, but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach0.95, only modestly faster than the B-52 at the same altitudes. It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long <b>journey</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> USA to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF's doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only {{a short period of time}} between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.|$|E
