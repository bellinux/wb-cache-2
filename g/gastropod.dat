40|$|<b>Gastropods</b> are a {{large and}} highly diversified class within the phylum Mollusca. Many <b>gastropods</b> possess a shell whereas some are without shells. The shelled <b>gastropods</b> are also called univalves. Some of these <b>gastropods</b> are {{terrestrial}} while other <b>gastropods</b> live in marine or freshwater habitat. There are approximately 85, 000 - 100000 described species of molluscs (Strong et al., 2008) found throughout {{the world from the}} garden to deep-water hydrothermal vent colonies.

500|$|Chrysomallon squamiferum, {{common name}} the scaly-foot <b>gastropod,</b> is {{a species of}} deep-sea {{hydrothermal}}-vent snail, a marine <b>gastropod</b> mollusc in the family Peltospiridae. This vent-endemic <b>gastropod</b> is known only from deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean, {{where it has been}} found at depths of about [...] C. squamiferum differs greatly from other deep-sea gastropods, even the closely related neomphalines. The shell is of a unique construction, with three layers; the outer layer consists of iron sulfides, the middle layer is equivalent to the organic periostracum found in other gastropods, and the innermost layer is made of aragonite. The foot is also unusual, being armored at the sides with iron-mineralised sclerites.|$|E

50|$|Almost all marine <b>gastropods</b> breathe with a gill, {{but many}} {{freshwater}} species, {{and the majority}} of terrestrial species, have a pallial lung. <b>Gastropods</b> with a lung belong to one group with common descent, the Pulmonata, however, <b>gastropods</b> with gills are paraphyletic.

50|$|James Hamilton McLean (born 1936) is an American malacologist, a {{biologist}} who studies mollusks. He specializes in marine <b>gastropods.</b> He has studied many families of Eastern Pacific <b>gastropods</b> including the Fissurellidae, Trochidae, Turbinidae and Liotiidae, {{and also has}} investigated deep sea <b>gastropods</b> from hydrothermal vents.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gastropods</b> {{are defined}} as snails and slugs, {{belonging}} to a larger group called Molluscs. <b>Gastropods</b> have unique reproductive systems, varying significantly from one taxonomic group to another. They can be separated into three categories: marine, freshwater, and land. Reproducing in marine or freshwater environments makes getting sperm to egg much easier for <b>gastropods,</b> while on land {{it is much more}} difficult to get sperm to egg. The majority of <b>gastropods</b> have internal fertilization, but there are some prosobranch species that have external fertilization. <b>Gastropods</b> are capable of being either male or female, or hermaphrodites, and this makes their reproduction system unique amongst many other invertebrates. Hermaphroditic <b>gastropods</b> possess both the egg and sperm gametes which gives them the opportunity to self-fertilize.|$|R

The largest A. vaccaria has been {{measured}} at 99 cm in length and weighing in at almost 14 kg). An extremely large species of fossil <b>gastropod</b> is Campanile giganteum.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>gastropods</b> were {{exclusively}} marine, {{with the}} earliest {{representatives of the}} group appearing in the Late Cambrian (Chippewaella, Strepsodiscus). Early Cambrian forms like Helcionella and Scenella are no longer considered <b>gastropods,</b> and the tiny coiled Aldanella of earliest Cambrian time is probably not even a mollusk. By the Ordovician period the <b>gastropods</b> were a varied group present {{in a range of}} aquatic habitats. Commonly, fossil <b>gastropods</b> from the rocks of the early Palaeozoic era are too poorly preserved for accurate identification. Still, the Silurian genus Poleumita contains fifteen identified species. Fossil <b>gastropods</b> were less common during the Palaeozoic era than bivalves.|$|R
