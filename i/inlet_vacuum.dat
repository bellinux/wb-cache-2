50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and <b>inlet</b> <b>vacuum</b> combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving pulleys, driven directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar driven pulleys, connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the driven pulleys were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the drive pulleys expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|E

50|$|A {{principal}} concern when {{designing a}} central vacuum system is avoiding situations {{likely to cause}} clogging of the tubing with debris such as toothpicks, hairpins, needles, or similar-shaped objects. The most important safeguard is at the <b>vacuum</b> <b>inlets,</b> which are intentionally designed with a tighter radius of curvature than any other bends in the system. This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove. Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).|$|R

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{documents the}} development of the single particle laser ablation time-of-flight mass spectrometer (SPLAT). The SPLAT instrument determines the size and chemical composition of single aerosol particles. The particle velocity is measured by two continuous laser beams, followed by evaporation of the particles and ionization of the components by Laser Desorption/Ionization. The produced ions are detected in a bipolar time of flight mass spectrometer. Besides a detailed discussion of the mass spectrometer, this works focus lies on the <b>inlet,</b> the <b>vacuum</b> system and interaction of the ionization laser with the particles. All technical parts are chosen for the future use on board of a research aircraft. Extensive laboratory studies have been carried out to characterize and to improve the SPLAT instrument. Within the mediterranean intensive oxidant study (MINOS) first field measurements have been performed in summer 2001. The collected data indicate that particles with a diameter of a few micrometers were mainly composed of mineral dust.

5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air return ducts (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>inlet</b> fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|R
5000|$|Another tubing option, {{which is}} {{becoming}} popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is [...] "Schedule 40" [...] standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs {{are exposed to}} mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to 2+3/8 in, requiring fittings designed for this. To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central <b>vacuum</b> <b>inlets</b> and power unit.|$|R

40|$|A {{continued}} {{desire for}} increased mobility {{in the aftermath}} of natural disasters, or on the battlefield, has lead to the need for improved light-weight bridging solutions. This research investigates the development of a carbon/ epoxy composite bridging system to meet the needs for light-weight bridging. The research focuses on two main topics. The first topic is that of processing composite structures and the second is the design and testing of these structures. In recent years the Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) process has become recognized as a low-cost manufacturing alternative for large Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite structures for civil, military, and aerospace applications. The success of the VARTM process (complete wet-out) is very sensitive to the resin injection strategy used and the proper placement of flow distribution materials and <b>inlet</b> and <b>vacuum</b> ports. Predicting the flow front pattern, the time required for infusing a part with resin, and the time required to bleed excess resin at the end of filling, is critical to ensure that the part will become completely impregnated and desired fiber volume fractions achieved prior to the resin gelling (initiation of cure). In order to eliminate costly trial and error experiments to determine the optimal infusion strategy, this research presents a simulation model which considers in-plane flow as well as flow through the thickness of the preform. In addition to resin filling, the current model is able to simulate the bleeding of resin at the end of filling to predict the required bleeding time to reach desired fiber volume fractions for the final part. In addition to processing, the second portion of the dissertation investigates the design and testing of composite bridge deck sections which also serve as short-span bridging for gaps up to 4 m in length.

The fundamental aspects were probed for better understanding of the novel ionization processes. Initial applications were attempted to utilize the novel ionization methods for fast, robust, and quantitative analyses. For inlet ionizations (laserspray ionization inlet, LSII; matrix assisted ionization inlet, MAII; and solvent assisted ionization inlet, SAII), small (e. g. drugs) to large (e. g. proteins) non-volatile molecules are ionized with the assistance of heat and pressure drop, and are operated from AP. The ease of operation, rapidness of data acquisition, and simplicity of coupling with other techniques achieved by SAII, have enabled the inlet ionization for high throughput multiplexing analyses, hyphenation with liquid chromatography (especially at low flow rates), and fast surface assessment and drug quantifications. LSII has been utilized together with solvent-free sample preparation and solvent-free gas-phase separation for total solvent-free analysis. The production of multiply charged ions from solid states by vacuum ionization was utilized to encompass the advantages from ESI and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), for better characterization from surfaces and extending the mass range of high performance mass spectrometers.
