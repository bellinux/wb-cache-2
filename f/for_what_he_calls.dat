5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> a Rack Bomb. With only 13 {{seconds left in the}} match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} {{sometimes}} referred to by their Yiddish name, spelled either mun or mon (written מאָן), which comes from the German word for poppy, Mohn, as used in Mohnbrötchen. American chef John Mitzewich suggests a recipe <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> “San Francisco-Style Bagels”. His recipe yields bagels flatter than New York-style bagels, characterized by a rough-textured crust. An everything bagel may include such toppings as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, caraway seeds, garlic flakes, pretzel salt, and pepper.|$|E
25|$|After {{agreeing to}} work on the Winklevoss twins' concept, Zuckerberg {{approaches}} his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Thefacebook, an online social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Mark to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook website itself.|$|E

500|$|Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, {{although}} the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully [...] "Indianised". As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay {{with a similar}} scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses {{the style of the}} Western genre into a [...] "feudalistic ethos". Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholays [...] "hysterical visual style" [...] and intermittent [...] "populist message". Cultural critic and Islamist scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle.|$|E

2500|$|An {{entirely new}} {{proposal}} {{has been made}} by A. Willi, who suggests that the original name of the letter in ancient Greek was angma (...) [...] This proposal {{is based on a}} passage in a Latin grammarian, Varro, who uses this name <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> a [...] "25th letter" [...] of the alphabet. Varro himself is clearly not referring to sampi, but is using angma to refer to the ng sound [...] in words like angelus. However, Varro ascribes the use of the name angma to an ancient Ionian Greek author, Ion of Chios. Willi conjectures that Varro misunderstood Ion, believing the name angma referred to the [...] sound because that sound happened to occur in the name itself. However, Ion, in speaking of a [...] "25th letter of the alphabet", meant not just a different pronunciation of some other letters but an actual written letter in its own right, namely sampi. According to Willi's hypothesis, the name angma would have been derived from the verbal root *ank-, [...] "to bend, curve", and referred to a [...] "crooked object", used because of the hook-like shape of the letter.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his guest}} review for Roger Ebert's website, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{outright}} panned the film, giving it zero {{out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "aggressively tasteless", and {{going so far as}} to say [...] "Movie 43 is the Citizen Kane of awful". He wrote that the film has nothing in common with The Groove Tube and The Kentucky Fried Movie, two [...] "very funny and influential" [...] sketch-comedy films. He additionally criticized Movie 43 <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "female humiliation", saying that although the men are [...] "jerks, idiots, dolts and fools", the women have it even worse. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Farrelly's film as [...] "the work of a confused man thrashing around in an industry he no longer understands". Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars and called it the worst film he had ever seen. Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it a negative review, saying, [...] "As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now, I can't think of one worse than Movie 43." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Cekada, an {{assistant}} pastor of sedevacantist bishop Daniel Dolan, {{in his book}} Work of Human Hands, says that the Mass of Paul VI is invalid and moreover [...] strips down or removes completely every prayer in the Latin Rite which covers subjects such [...] as judgment, heaven and hell, Satan, et al., and suggests that their full-scale removal, if such were to happen, would contribute {{to a lack of}} self-discipline and eventual loss of faith and skepticism among Catholics, responding to the post hoc ergo propter hoc accusation above. He criticizes the Mass of Paul VI <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> its [...] "Protestantizations", such as referring to the service as a [...] "supper" [...] with a [...] "table" [...] and [...] "cup" [...] instead of a [...] "sacrifice" [...] with an [...] "altar" [...] and [...] "chalice", making the congregation, in his view, the center of worship instead of God, and so forth. He claims that the Mass of Paul VI uses a Modernist method of mixing traditional language with Protestant language to appeal to both sides, and thus falling into heresy, {{in the same way as}} the Church of England is said to be [...] "both Catholic and Reformed". The observation about the use of the word [...] "cup", rather than [...] "chalice", concerned only the English translation in use from 1973 to 2011, which employed both terms. [...] It does not concern the original Latin text of the Mass of Paul VI, translations into other languages, or the present English translation, which always uses the word [...] "chalice".|$|E
