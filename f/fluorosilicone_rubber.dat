40|$|Imide‐containing vinyl {{fluorosilicone}} resin (MR‐VFS) was synthesized from maleated rosin (MR). And then, with MR‐VFS {{as a new}} polar cross‐linking {{agent in}} a heat curable <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> composition, a series of maleated rosin‐modified fluorosilicone rubbers (MR‐FSR) were obtained. The effects of MR‐VFS on the mechanical properties, oil resistance, thermal stability, and low‐temperature performance were studied in detail. It was found that MR‐VFS could increase the tearing strength and high‐temperature thermal stability of <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> When the MR‐VFS weight content reached to 2 wt %, the tearing strength of MR‐FSR increased by 20. 1 % {{compared with that of}} common <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> However, MR‐FSR showed a similar low‐temperature resistance and a little worse oil resistance. The morphological study showed that incorporation of maleated rosin could intensify the microphase separation of <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

40|$|A novel imide {{modified}} vinyl‐containing fluorosilicone resin (MP‐VFS) was firstly prepared from maleopimaric acid (MPA), and {{characterized by}} 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. Containing MPA based imide heterocycle (MPABI), MP‐VFS was further {{used as a}} novel cross‐linker to prepare MPA modified <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> (MP‐FSR). Morphology, mechanical and oil‐resistance properties, thermal properties, and low temperature resistance of MP‐FSR had been studied. Microphase separation was observed in MP‐FSR. Although the tensile strength of <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> was not significantly enhanced, the tearing strength, breaking elongation, rebound resilience and hardness were effectively improved. When the MP‐VFS content was 2. 0 wt %, the tearing strength of MP‐FSR was increased by 23. 5 %, breaking elongation by 18. 6 % and rebound resilience by 9. 7 %. The thermal stability was enhanced due to the incorporation of MPABI. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

40|$|Homogeneous <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> {{membranes}} {{were prepared}} to study the dehydration of isopropyl alcohol by pervaporation. The membranes were either water-selective or isopropyl alcohol-selective, depending on the feed composition. The azeotropic composition of isopropyl alcohol-water system predicted using Margules Equation occurred at 41 mole% of water. However, the feed and permeate compositions {{were found to be}} equal in pervaporation experiments when the water content in the feed was approximately 70 mole%. Generally, water-selectivity was enhanced by pervaporation as compared to liquid-vapor equilibrium. Composite membranes were also prepared with a thin layer of <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> coated on top of a porous substrate polyethersulfone membrane. It was found that the performance of the composite membrane was affected by the molecular weight of polyethersulfone used to prepare the porous substrate. The performance of composite membrane became more consistent as the molecular weight of polyethersulfone became more uniform. The membrane selectivity increased with a decrease in the mean pore size...|$|E
40|$|L'accroissement des contraintes subies par les matériaux utilisés dans les {{techniques}} pétrolières et parapétrolières et liées aux températures et pressions élevées ainsi qu'aux agressions chimiques, fait que l'on exige de ces matériaux qu'ils soient de plus en plus performants. Ceci implique, pour les concepteurs et utilisateurs de matériel comportant des élastomères en contact avec les hydrocarbures, une connaissance actualisée des produits existants, lesquels sont en constante évolution. On commence donc par décrire les principales familles d'élastomères résistant en milieu pétrolier actuellement disponibles sur le marché. Puis, après avoir évoqué les problèmes que rencontrent les industries pétrolière et automobile dans l'utilisation des élastomères et présenté sommairement les résultats de travaux réalisés à l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), on définira quelques axes de recherches dont la finalité est de participer à l'amélioration des techniques pétrolières dans le sens d'une meilleure fiabilité et d'une réduction des coûts. The {{materials used}} in the oil and automotive industries are being subjected to higher and higher mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses, so these materials, and especially elastomers, {{have to be more}} and more resistant. For designers and users of equipment containing elastomers in contact with hydrocarbons, this requires an updated understanding of existing products. The aim of this article is thus to describe, first of all, the leading families of resistant elastomers now available for use in a petroleum environment, with particular emphasis on chlorinated, fluorinated, acrylic and nitrile rubbers and their derivatives, which have evolved greatly in recent years with the appearance of new varieties and new types of elastomers, such as Atlas, Vamac, Eypel, etc. For each family of elastomer, the structure is described along with the vulcanization method, its properties and its uses. Then the problems with which elastomers are confronted in the petroleum industry are described. They are mainly linked to the high pressures and temperatures encoutered in boreholes and to chemical attacks due to acid gases, corrosion inhibitors and completion and treatment fluids. Elastomers must also be resistant to blistering, extrusion and abrasion. The proper choice of a material can lead to a reduction in operating costs and to increased safety. Concerted action among elastomer producers and users seems indispensable. Problems in the automotive industry are linked to the increase in thermal stresses due to the raising of the temperature underneath the hood, to the use of new fuels, unleaded gasoline oxygenated fuel, and to the evolution of lubricant additives. This is leading to the progressive forsaking of nitrile rubber and polychloroprene to the benefit of higher-performance but more expensive elastomers such as fluorinated rubbers or hydrogenated nitrile <b>rubbers.</b> <b>Fluorosilicones</b> and acrylics are also being called upon for development in the automotive industry. Then several research findings made at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) are described, concerning the comparative analysis of the behavior of nitrile, hydrogenated nitrile and fluorinated rubbers in complex petroleum environments, together with a few examples of applications in the field of pumps, composite-material tubes with an elastomeric liner and gaskets. To conclude some suggestions are made on possibilities of improving elastomers for petroleum applications, based on {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon of blistering, an improvement of vulcanization systems and the optimizing of some elastomers such as HNBR. Progress is also possible in the behavior of elastomers with regard to lubricants and fuels and in the predicting of the lifetime of seals used in boreholes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{elaborate}} {{on the effect of}} a low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment the <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> polymers. In particular, we concentrate on the study of the influen of atomic oxygen (AO) and UV irradiation on their chemical, morphological, and mechani properties. The samples were exposed to the space environment in-flight and in a grou simulation radio frequency (RF) oxygen plasma Asher system. LEO environment was found to have a pronounced destructive effect on t <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> Exposure of the samples in space for 18 months (AO fluence 2. 1 × 1020 atoms/cm 2) during the POSA-II experiment resulted in cracking of their surface a changes in chemical composition, namely a decrease in the atomic concentration of fluori and an increase in the amount of oxygen by formation of silicon oxide. These changes indu stresses in the modified region and between the modified and virgin zones. The affect material is characterized by increased hardness and elastic modulus. AO fluence is a dominant factor in the sample deterioration: the specimen facing the M space station received lower AO flux (8 × 1019 atoms/cm 2) and, consequently, has less dama as compared to the specimen that faced outer space. Ground simulation of LEO environment by exposure to RF oxygen plasma produc similar effects to those of the space environment. Its impact is even stronger due to high levels of UV irradiation, albeit more concentrated in the near-surface region, as conclud from the comparison of nanoindentation measurements performed by an atomic for microscope and a conventional nanoindenter. We deduce that <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber</b> is not suitable for long duration utilization wh exposed to space environment due its chemical and mechanical instability. The undesir effects may include both destruction of the sealing and contamination of neighboring pa within line-of-sight with its outgassing products. ...|$|E

Since such fuels {{were not available}} at the time, synthetic alternate fuels were prepared by adding tetralin to a petroleum based Jet A type fuel to simulate coal derived fuels which are expected to contain higher amounts of aromatic and hydroaromatic hydrocarbons. The elastomeric compounds tested were based on butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber, a castable Thiokol polysulfide rubber, and a castable <b>fluorosilicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> Batches of various cross-link densities of these rubbers were made and their chemical stress relaxation behavior in fuel, air, and nitrogen, their swelling properties, and response to mechanical testing were determined...|$|E
