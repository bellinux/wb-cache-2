40|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> Podarcis siculus, {{has a wide}} distribution. However, {{information}} on several aspects of its ecology and biology are scarce, and relate mainly to insular populations. This paper describes the main morphological features of 123 individuals along a geographical gradient (five localities) in northwestern Tuscany (central Italy).

40|$|We {{studied the}} thermal ecology of an {{introduced}} {{population of the}} <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> Podarcis siculus, in Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). We measured field body temperatures of adult lizards, as well as air and substrate temperatures at their capture places, during spring and summer. We assessed the relations between body and air temperatures, and between body and substrate temperatures, for both seasons. We studied the preferred temperature range of P. siculus in a laboratory thermal gradient. In addition, we recorded the operative temperatures of the habitat of the <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> during summer. Then, we calculated the three indexes of behavioural thermoregulation for summer: thermal quality of the habitat, accuracy of thermoregulation, and effectiveness of thermoregulation. As expected, our results show that Italian wall lizards achieved significantly higher body temperatures during summer than during spring. Body temperatures were not significantly related to air temperatures in spring, but the correlation was significant in summer. In addition, body temperatures were not significantly related to substrate temperatures for any season. The preferred temperature range of the species was similar for males and females: 28. 40 - 31. 57 °C. Introduced Italian wall lizards of Menorca are effective thermoregulators, with an effectiveness of 0. 82 during summer. </p...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the green lizard (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand lizard and green lizard is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand lizard and green lizard. Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green lizard could possibly pass into a predator of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand lizard and green lizard became competitors (or predators) of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R

40|$|Using molecular, biochemical, and cytological tools, {{we studied}} the {{nucleotide}} and the deduced {{amino acid sequence}} of PHI/VIP {{and the distribution of}} VIP/VPAC receptor system in the testis of the <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis sicula to evaluate the involvement of such a neuropeptide in the spermatogenesis control. We demonstrated that (1) Podarcis sicula VIP had a high identity with other vertebrate VIP sequences, (2) differently from mammals, VIP was synthesized directly in the testis, and (3) VIP and its receptor VPAC 2 were widely distributed in germ and somatic cells, while the VPAC 1 R had a distribution limited to Leydig cells.

Coleoptera, Hymenoptera (ants), Araneae and Gastropoda were the most represented taxa (numerical abundance of ca 22, 7, 7, 6 % respectively). We found Brillouin diversity index similar in females and in males, with a marked overlap between sexes, but differences in niche overlap- ping among localities. Diet spectrum was quite different with that found in other central Italy localities, in the Tuscan Archipelago, or in areas where P. siculus has recently introduced.

40|$|Abstract. Biological invasions are a {{challenge}} to conservation and constitute a threat to biodiversity worldwide. The <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis sicula has been widely introduced, and seems capable of adapting {{to most of the}} regions where it is established and to impact on native biota. Here we construct a phylogenetic framework to assess the origin of the introduced populations in the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey comparing cytochrome-b gene sequences of lizards from five locations to published sequences from the native range and other non-native locations. The results support an origin from central Italy for the United Kingdom population, from the Adriatic region for the Greek pop-ulation and from Calabria for the population from Turkey. These results emphasise the multiple-source pattern of introduction of this species identified in previous studies. The improvement in the knowledge of the origin and path-ways by which invaders arrive in new areas, as well as the monitoring of their populations, are crucial for successful strategies to deal with exotic species...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the cytological and molecular effects of cadmium, a toxic heavy metal, in the liver of the <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> Podarcis sicula. Cadmium was administered in single dose, by diet, to induce a concentration comparable with that measured in animals living in contaminated sites. For comparison, cadmium was also administered in multiple doses by food (chronic) or in a single dose intraperitoneally (i. p.); the effects were followed at regular time intervals up to 30 days post treatments. Atomic absorption spectrometry analysis demonstrated cadmium ion uptake and accumulation in the parenchyma with an estimated half-life of approximately 8 days. Cytological analyses revealed that the metal induced oedema, activated metallothionein expression in Kupffer cells and extracellular matrix production in fat storing cells. It also caused swelling and alteration in lipid and sugar metabolism in hepatocytes. In conclusion, in the wall lizard cadmium is toxic to the liver even at very low concentrations, the response is not strictly dose and time dependent and almost no recovery occurs in short (30 days) time period...|$|E
40|$|Some insular lizards show a {{high degree}} of {{differentiation}} from their conspecific mainland populations, like Licosa island lizards, which are described as affected by Reversed Island Syndrome (RIS). In previous works, we demonstrated that some traits of RIS, as melanization, depend on a differential expression of gene encoding melanocortin receptors. To better understand the basis of syndrome, and providing raw data for future investigations, we generate the first de novo transcriptome of the <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b> Comparing mainland and island transcriptomes, we link differences in life-traits to differential gene expression. Our results, taking together testis and brain sequences, generated 275, 310 and 269, 885 transcripts, 18, 434 and 21, 606 proteins in Gene Ontology annotation, for mainland and island respectively. Variant calling analysis identified about the same number of SNPs in island and mainland population.

40|$|Cadmium, a {{transition}} metal, is highly toxic to reproductive tissues causing organ damage and functional deficiency in both males (Blottner et al., 1999; Foote, 1999; Leoni et al., 2002) and females (Wier et al., 1990; De Swapan et al., 1993; Bires et al., 1995; Hen Chow & Cheng, 2003; Nampoothiri et al., 2007; Zhang & Jia, 2007; Thompson et al., 2008).

Studies reported here analyse the effects of cadmium on ovarian follicles in the female <b>Italian</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard.</b> Podarcis sicula may be good bioindicator of heavy metal contamination since it lives in close contact with the soil, being therefore exposed to intoxication by food and inhalation. Effects of three different experimental treatments have been evaluated by analysing damage in follicle architecture and by searching for changes in cell proliferation by PCNA (proliferating cells nuclear antigen) immunolocalisation.
