In esterifications and acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic acid halides or anhydrides.

The very diversity of catabolic enzymes present in cultures that degrade halogenated aliphatics and the occurrence of molecular mechanisms for genetic adaptation serve as good starting points for the evolution of catabolic pathways for compounds that are currently still resistant to biodegradation. ...|$|R

40|$|The thermal, {{photochemical}} and reductive <b>dehalogenations</b> of {{methyl chloride}} (H 3 C-Cl) are studied with the ab initio MCSCFmethod using three different basis sets (3 - 2 lG*, 6 - 31 G* and 6 - 31 +G*).

The photochemical decomposition involves excitation of the H 3 C-Clmolecule from the singlet ground state to a singlet or triplet n-u* state which dissociates directly to these products. The reductivedehalogenation involves the formation of a metastable anion (resulting from electron transfer to the chloromethane) which dissociatesimmediately to a methyl radical and chloride anion.

40|$|Five {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{were tested}} for {{their abilities to}} transform tetrachloromethane so that information about enzymes involved in reductive <b>dehalogenations</b> of polychloromethanes could be obtained. Cultures of the sulfate reducer Desulfobacterium autotrophicum transformed some 80 microM tetrachloromethane to trichloromethane and {{a small amount of}} dichloromethane in 18 days under conditions of heterotrophic growth. The acetogens Acetobacterium woodii and Clostridium thermoaceticum in fructose-salts and glucose-salts media, respectively, degraded some 80 microM tetrachloromethane completely within 3 days. Trichloromethane accumulated as a transient intermediate, but the only chlorinated methanes recovered {{at the end of the}} incubation were 8 microM dichloromethane and traces of chloromethane. Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and an autotrophic, nitrate-reducing bacterium were unable to transform tetrachloromethane. Reduction of chlorinated methanes was thus observed only in the organisms with the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway. Experiments with [14 C]tetrachloromethane were done to determine the fate of this compound in the acetogen A. woodii. Radioactivity in an 11 -day heterotrophic culture was largely (67 %) recovered in CO 2, acetate, pyruvate, and cell material. In experiments with cell suspensions to which [14 C]tetrachloromethane was added, 14 CO 2 appeared within 20 s as the major transformation product.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{research was}} the development of new, safe, effective methods for the electrochemical detection and degradation of organohalide pollutants. The major focus was {{on the use of}} cationic surfactants, particularly didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), to influence the course of electrochemical reactions. ^ Bicontinuous DDAB microemulsions were compared to organic solvents as media for the electrocatalytic reduction of benzal chloride and benzyl bromide. Microemulsions made from water, oil and DDAB behaved similar to organic solvent + proton donor for the mediated reactions. The reductive <b>dehalogenations</b> involve competition between radical and anion formation. Radical formation favors dimerization products, as were obtained cleanly using vitamin B 12 as catalyst. The results suggested that C-C bond formation can be controlled by changing the electrolysis conditions, especially potential. These and related compounds might be reductively dehalogenated in toxic wastes materials using microemulsions, which are less toxic and less expensive than organic solvents. ^ A reversed-phase liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection was used for the separation and detection of haloacetic acids (HAAs). The detector contained a Nafion-DDAB coated PG electrode. The signal-to-noise ratio was decreased, the reduction potential was shifted to more positive values and the reduction current was increased for most of the acids, giving a higher sensitivity for Nafion-DDAB-PG compared to bare PG electrodes. The method is less sensitive than gas chromatography with electron capture detector but analysis of real water samples is possible. However, a better preconcentration method or more sensitive detection is required for routine analysis. ...|$|R

50|$|Alkali and {{alkaline}} earth metals such as Lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium {{has proven to}} be great <b>dehalogenation</b> catalysts. During <b>dehalogenation</b> reaction, the metals act as a reducing agent to break down carbon-halogen bond. Halogen can then leave as a leaving group. The generic way to synthesize alkanes using alkali and alkaline-earth metal is shown in scheme 2: Yus and his co-workers synthesized various lithium naphthalenide compounds that acts as a catalyst for lithiation of different functionalized halogenated arenes. The Li-arene reacted with water or deuterium to produce the dehalogenated product. The major drawback of using lithium naphthalene catalysts is {{that it is hard to}} separate from the reaction mixture because naphthalene adsorbs on surface of arene substrates. In polymer chemistry, sodium metal has been used for <b>dehalogenation</b> process.Removal of halogen atom from arene-halides in the presence of Grignard agent and water for the formation of new compound is known as Grignard degradation. <b>Dehalogenation</b> using Grignard reagents is a two steps hydrodehalogenation process.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of new and improved labeling procedures for introducing deuterium and tritium into organic compounds with the intention that some of the methods can be applied to more complex compounds such as biomaterials. The thesis consists of 6 chapters. In the first of these the necessary background information relating to biomaterials and the currently used methods of preparing deuteriated/tritiated compounds is presented, whilst in the second chapter various aspects of the use of our Tri-Sorber unit, unique to universities, are presented. The instrument allows H 2, D 2 and T 2 to be stored on uranium beds and does away with the many problems {{associated with the use of}} a glass gas line; this is especially true for T 2. In Chapter 3 the advantages of using microwaves in the area of aromatic <b>dehalogenations</b> are explored. The use of solid formates (DCOO-K+) in preference to D 2 gas, combined with microwave irradiation, greatly increases the rates of these reactions although there are still instances where reactions do not proceed satisfactorily. In Chapter 4 it is shown for the first time how the pattern of microwave-enhanced Raney nickel isotope exchange reactions can be influenced, depending on the deuteriated solvent employed. General labeling through to specific labeling is reported. In Chapter 5 the benefits of using microwave and solid donors in hydrogenation reactions are explored; some examples of microwave-enhanced hydrogenations in the absence of solvent, as well as in the presence of solvent, are reported. Finally, in the last, brief chapter some of the new developments reported in the earlier chapters are applied to the attempted deuteriation of a biocompatible polymer and a model compound...|$|R

50|$|Among halogens, {{fluorine}} is {{the most}} electronegative atom and will have the highest tendency to make the strongest bond with carbon. The rate of <b>dehalogenation</b> depends on the bond strength between carbon and halogen atom. The bond dissociation energies of carbon-halogen bonds are described as: H3C-I (234 KJmol-1), H3C-Br (293 KJmol-1), H3C-Cl (351 KJmol-1), and H3C-F (452 KJmol-1). Thus, for the same structures the bond dissociation rate for <b>dehalogenation</b> will be: F<< Cl < Br < I. Additionally, the rate of <b>dehalogenation</b> for alkyl halide also varies with steric environment and follows this trend: primary > secondary > tertiary halides.|$|E

Iodothyronine deiodinase (not the enzyme that is the topic of this article) uses a selenocysteine active site for catalysis, {{is a member of}} the thioredoxin superfamily, and removes iodide only when the substrate is in a double-tyrosine form. By contrast, iodotyrosine deiodinase (the topic enzyme) does not require selenocysteine or cysteine for catalysis, is part of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily, and removes iodide when the substrate is a single amino acid. Research on iodotyrosine deiodinase has historically been variable and slow due to its lack of stability and arduous purification. Only recently has this enzyme been studied more deeply.|$|E
