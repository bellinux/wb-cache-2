5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{expensive than the}} tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line {{was connected to the}} old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, {{trade talks}} were conducted, but not completed, between the Beaneaters and the Philadelphia Quakers. The deal likely {{involved}} Stivetts and Tucker, two players involved in Boston's religious quarrel {{from the previous}} season. As the season progressed, the press noted that his season had begun better than the previous season. Stivetts claimed {{that it was his}} weight loss (now just over 200lbs), that was the main reason why he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> of an asset to the team than in past years.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded tightly around the body. Women are also {{portrayed in the}} pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, {{in contrast to the}} toga, and for educated people, since it was associated with philosophers. By the 4th century, the toga <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> or less replaced by the pallium as a garment that embodied social unity.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he felt his writing staff {{would have been able to}} work more effectively if there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> guidelines on the characters' behavior and function. Henson said he felt the type of humor being written for the show was tedious and unimaginative.|$|E
5|$|The most {{essential}} change {{consisted of a}} more monumental composition. The temple had been enlarged considerably and given a more stern shape, and the figures <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> closely assembled and they formed an unbroken relief-like row. The sketch was put on exhibition in the museum in November 1913 and {{in a letter to}} Ludvig Looström, the director of the museum, Larsson offered the painting for 35,000 Swedish kronor.|$|E
50|$|Horabagridae is a {{proposed}} family of catfishes containing three genera, Horabagrus, Platytropius and Pseudeutropius.

A year after the attacks, Mumbai police {{continued}} to complain that Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared any information about American suspects Headley and Rana, but that the FBI <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> seriously damaged {{than the}} British frigates, and {{was closer to}} shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E

5|$|In the aftermath, Robert forced Henry {{to leave}} Rouen, {{probably}} because Henry's {{role in the}} fighting <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> prominent than his own, and possibly because Henry had asked to be formally reinstated as the count of the Cotentin. In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table. The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts {{to regain control of}} the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands. They nominated each other as heirs to England and Normandy, excluding Henry from any succession while either one of them lived.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{offices on}} the West Coast <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{directly}} involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.|$|E
5|$|The one Germanic-language {{speaking}} {{country that}} {{was not included in}} the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the United Kingdom, in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. Günther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries. Günther referred to this historical process as Aufnordung ("additional nordification"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the survival of the fittest among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} also {{resulted in}} severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city {{until the end of}} September. Over those three months, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin heavy, in terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Within an hour {{of their}} opening volleys the British and French lines were hopelessly confused, with three {{separate}} engagements being fought within sight of one another. In the van, Caesar had finally attempted to join the fight, only to have a vital spar shot away by Trajan which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle. Bellerophon and Leviathan were {{in the thick of}} the action, the outnumbered Bellerophon taking serious damage to her rigging. This left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents, of which Eole also suffered severely. Captain William Johnstone Hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support; the frigate HMS Latona under Captain Edward Thornbrough arrived to provide assistance. Thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the French battleline and opened fire on Eole, helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing Bellerophon to safety. Leviathan, under Lord Hugh Seymour, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> successful than Bellerophon, her gunnery dismasting America despite receiving fire from Eole and Trajan in passing. Leviathan only left America after a two-hour duel, sailing at 11:50 to join Queen Charlotte in the centre.|$|E
