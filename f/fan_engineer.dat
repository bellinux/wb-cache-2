50|$|Airflow was {{established}} in 1955 in the garage of its founder, Connor Wilson {{at his home in}} High Wycombe in conjunction with Gwilym (Bill) Leighton Myles. Wilson was a <b>fan</b> <b>engineer</b> by trade and invented the first inclined Manometer to go into commercial production Bill Myles being the Sales Director. The original wooden device, which measured positive, negative and differential pressure, was the forerunner of a range of air flow measuring instruments for HVAC applications which are still sold around the world.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the inlet}} and outlet of hidden ceiling fan are almost {{located at the}} same Plane; thus, an {{improper}} housing may cause inhale-return phenomenon which significantly affects its power consumption and performance. In this study, a comprehensive investigation by numerical and experimental techniques was used to predict and identify the flow pattern, airflow rate, efficiency, and noise for ceiling fans with different design parameters. The {{results showed that the}} unique inhale-return phenomenon happens for an inappropriate housing. Several key parameters, such as fan guard, housing ring, inlet-to-outlet area ratio, and blockage height, are evaluated for finding out the criterion to avoid the inhale-return flow. Consequently the study finds that fan guard changes the airflow to a wider distribution with a lower velocity. A minimum blockage distance and a maximum height of ring-plate are set at 80 mm and 30 mm, respectively. Also, it is suggested that the inlet area must be bigger than the outlet area. Moreover, all the parameters show the same trend under various rotational speeds. In conclusion, this systematic investigation not only provides the <b>fan</b> <b>engineer's</b> design ability to avoid the inhale-return phenomenon, but also the predicting capability on its aerodynamic and acoustic performances...|$|R
5000|$|... "Unobtainium" [...] {{has come}} {{to be used as a}} synonym for [...] "unobtainable" [...] among people who are neither science fiction <b>fans</b> nor <b>engineers</b> to denote an object that {{actually}} exists, but which is very hard to obtain either because of high price (sometimes referred to as [...] "unaffordium") or limited availability. It usually refers to a very high-end and desirable product; for instance, in the mountain biking community, [...] "These titanium hubs are unobtainium, man!" [...] Old-car enthusiasts use [...] "unobtainium" [...] to describe parts that are vanishingly rare or no longer available.|$|R
5000|$|A music <b>fan</b> {{and radio}} <b>engineer,</b> Brian Cabena, was unhappy about {{being unable to}} listen to the music he liked on the radio - and he did {{something}} about it. After much unsuccessful lobbying of radio stations, he {{turned his attention to the}} government. He argued that if the existing stations were not willing to program for classical music fans, the government should license new stations that would.|$|R
50|$|Cashen {{spent his}} early years writing songs and {{performing}} in various groups around Brisbane, this resulted in his first independently released EP 'Lifeboat' in 2003. In 2004 he {{made the decision to}} go solo and spent the next three years working on his debut album 'Threads' which was well received by critics and <b>fans.</b> 'Threads' was <b>engineered</b> and produced by noted Australian producer Steve Scanlon, known for his work with artists such as Vanessa Amorosi & Kate Alexa.|$|R
50|$|Soon after Reznor's departure, Nordstrom asked Trent {{to record}} vocals {{for some of}} his songs at a local engineer's studio (not Trevethan's studio). As a <b>fan</b> the local <b>engineer</b> was given the band's other {{recorded}} material. After Reznor became famous, the engineer {{thought there was a}} market for anything Reznor and in 1997 assembled a CD including tracks recorded at his studio, the previously recorded demo tracks from 1983, and a radio interview from 1984. The unauthorized CD was released in 1997 on the Shriek Records label.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 {{construction}} of a gaming expansion and showroom were completed to provide the only Ticketmaster-approved venue in the area. [...] The popularity of the casino provided sufficient revenue for the OIN to build second and third hotels at the site to satisfy demand. Construction of the new hotel was finished in late 2004. One of the hotels is the tallest structure between Syracuse and Albany to serve the common guest; the other hotel is a luxury resort that caters to golf customers and <b>fans.</b> DeSimone Consulting <b>Engineers</b> is the structural engineering firm for the project.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 Nicolas Livaditis, an avid Ys <b>fan</b> and {{software}} <b>engineer,</b> spearheaded an English fan translation {{project for the}} first PC remake, Ys I Complete. This led to other projects for Ys II Complete, Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys, Ys: The Ark of Napishtim, Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin, though not all were completed; the Ys VI project for example, was cancelled to respect Konami's licensing rights. Completed translation patches were made for Ys I & II Complete and Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys. In 2010, Xseed Games purchased the fan-translated script for Ys: The Oath in Felghana from Jeff Nussbaum, the actual translator, an act considered historic and unprecedented, as unlicensed translations are technically copyright infringements as unauthorized derivative works. XSEED went on to purchase three more fan-translated scripts for Ys I, Ys II, and Ys Origin.|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle is an {{engineering}} marvel perhaps only exceeded by the station itself. The shuttle {{was based on}} the technology of the 1960 s and early 1970 s. It had to overcome significant challenges to make it reusable. Perhaps the greatest challenges were the main engines and the Thermal Protection System. The program has seen terrible tragedy in its 3 decades of operation, yet it has also seen marvelous success. One of the most notable successes is the Hubble Space Telescope, a program {{that would have been a}} failure without the shuttle's capability to rendezvous, capture, repair, as well as upgrade. Now Hubble is a shining example of success admired by people around the world. As the program comes to a close, it is important to capture the legacy of the shuttle for future generations. That is what "Wings In Orbit" does for space <b>fans,</b> students, <b>engineers,</b> and scientists. This book, written by the men and women who made the program possible, will serve as an excellent reference for building future space vehicles. We are proud to have played a small part in making it happen. Our journey to document the scientific and engineering accomplishments of this magnificent winged vehicle began with an audacious proposal: to capture the passion of those who devoted their energies to its success while answering the question "What are the most significant accomplishments?" of the longestoperating human spaceflight program in our nation s history. This is intended to be an honest, accurate, and easily understandable account of the research and innovation accomplished during the era...|$|R
40|$|Glencoe Stream {{is a small}} {{watershed}} drainingslopes of the Sealy Range in the SouthernAlps, New Zealand. It flows alongside theHermitage Hotel at Aoraki Mount Cook Village {{which is}} a world heritage site with spectacular views towards Mount Cook. The stream is very active and poses a debris flow threat to the hotel {{as shown by the}} serious event which occurred in December, 1957. It has developed a debris and alluvial fan in post glacial time which has spread out over the recent glacial deposits in the Hooker valley, to which Glencoe Stream is a tributary. In 1996 the authors studied the geotechnical hazards in the watershed and designed engineering works to protect the hotel complex. An approximate relationship was developed between the magnitude and frequency of flood and debris flow events. The size of events and estimated return periods, together with the assessment of severity or consequences, allowed the level of risk to be addressed. Mitigative measures to protect against the hazards to provide a level of protec-tion comparable to those in other jurisdictions in mountainous terrain were addressed. Design parameters were taken to be a debris flow with a 1 : 200 return period, a pure water flood of 25 cumecs, and a required debris storage volume of 100 000 m 3. Active mitigative measures considered included engineered structures to channel the events into a developed storage area and passive measures included land use zoning and planning restrictions. The engineered measures do not provide protection against extreme events and a residual risk always remains to developments on the <b>fan.</b> The <b>engineered</b> measures were completed in 1999 at a cost of NZ $ 1. 3 M and the zoning to allow controlled development has also been put in place...|$|R
2500|$|The Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company {{was formed}} in 1887, {{with the goal of}} {{developing}} the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city. Railroad magnate James J. Hill organized the investors, who were primary owners of large amounts of stock in the Great Northern Railway. It was capitalized at $5 million. Hill sold stock to many of his friends, including Philip Danforth Armour, Charles Arthur Broadwater, Marshall Field, John Murray Forbes, Daniel Willis James, John Stewart Kennedy, Leonard Lewisohn and Charles Elliott Perkins. One of the stockholders in the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Co. (GFWPTC) was Paris Gibson, a friend of Hill's and {{the driving force behind the}} founding of the city of Great Falls. Gibson realized that the Great Falls of the Missouri could provide abundant, cheap electricity for industry, and proceeded to promote the town on this basis. But Gibson's plan meant actually building one or more dams to supply the dreamt-of power. The company immediately began purchasing riverside land and water rights along the Missouri River from Black Eagle Falls down to Sheep Creek (a distance of about [...] ). In time, it owned almost all the land set aside for the city of Great Falls as well as an additional [...] of waterside property. GFWPTC employed J.T. <b>Fanning,</b> a hydraulic <b>engineer,</b> to survey Black Eagle Falls in the summer of 1887 to determine the suitability of the falls and the best location for a dam. Plans for a dam were drawn up, but no action was taken at that time.|$|R
