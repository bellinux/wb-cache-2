500|$|Both A.auricula-judae and {{the similar}} A.polytricha are popular in China, where the {{medicinal}} use of food is common; a soup containing {{the species is}} used medicinally for dealing with colds and fevers by reducing {{the heat of the}} body. There is evidence that the species were being cultivated in China as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907). Li Shizhen, in his Pen Tsao Kang Mu, quotes Tang Ying-chuan from that period as saying [...] "... put the steamed bran on logs, cover with straw, Wood Ear will grow". In the early 20th century, large volumes of A.auricula-judae were exported from Australia to China, and it is today still sold in Asian food shops for culinary use. It is also popular in Vietnam, although the climate <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>more</b> suited to A.polytricha. A report on small-scale fungi cultivation concluded that A.auricula-judae would be suitable for cultivation only in cooler climates. According to a 2010 publication, the annual production of Auricularia species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and medicinal mushrooms, and in China, the estimated output was roughly 1.655 million tonnes (based on 2003 data), most of which are A.polytricha however (which has by and large replaced A.auricula-judae in international trade).|$|E
