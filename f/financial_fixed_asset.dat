The big number of <b>financial</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> generates considerable damage to the business environment which in such a critical period of the economic crisis has been its own cause – lack of cash.

Business can be stimulated by supporting robust investments and can be challenged by sale, lease or rental of in progress tangible assets that if completed, they would produce added value and would lead to a real value of public patrimony. Domestic and international economic conditions are conducive to such an approach while the Government and local authorities are required to carry out, in a concerted effort, a financial audit of all the intangible <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and, {{on the basis of its}} findings, to adopt the most appropriate measures.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the relationship between working capital management and profitability of the company. Working capital is considered as an important issue in financial management and has an effect on liquidity as well as on the company's profitability. In addition, the optimal working capital management made a great contribution in the achievement of corporate goals. In this study, the authors have selected a sample of six oil palm plantation companies in Indonesia Stock Exchange in the period 2009 - 2015. Profitability as the dependent variable is measured by the return on investment (ROI). Cash conversion cycle (CCC), current ratio (CR), financial debt ratio (FDR), and <b>fixed</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> ratio (FFAR) is an independent variables. The analysis model is a regression model using Fixed Effect Model panel. The results showed that there was a negative relationship between the variables of working capital and the profitability of the company. Profitability will be increased when the cash conversion cycle time is reduced. This is because the company has the cash conversion cycle time shorter able to collect the necessary cash for daily operations of the company. Current Ratio (CR) is one of the liquidity ratio, ie the ratio intended to measure the ability of a company to meet its short term obligations. Current ratio positive effect on the profitability of the company. The higher the CR of a company means less risk of failure of the company to meet its short term obligations. FDR hike will reduce the ROI of the ceteris paribus assumption. This is because more and more use of debt will reduce profitability. It can be concluded, most likely the companies of oil palm plantations in this study had an obligation or debt that is quite large. The results of this study also found that <b>fixed</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> positive effect on profitability.

In the case of China, economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (net of depreciation) over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> (iv) official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> to production.
