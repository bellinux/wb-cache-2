40|$|M. A. Although the <b>Free</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> (FDP) best {{performance}} at the polls was 12, 8 % of the votes in 1961, the party has played a far more significant role in postwar German politics than its electoral strength would suggest. Due to its participation as junior partner in coalitions with the Christian Democratic Union (1949 - 1956, 1961 - 966) and the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (1969 to present), the FOP has been represented in the Federal German Government longer than either the CDU or SPD. As it is exceptional for a single party to gain an overall majority in German politics, {{the two major parties}} are dependent on the FDP, as the only other party represented in the Bundestag, for the formation of a coalition government. Thus, in a certain sense, the FDP "determines" which of the major parties is to form the government. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the development of the FDP from 1945 to the present, whilst emphasizing variations in the party's political role. To provide a sufficient background, the development of German liberalism from the nineteenth century up to 1945 has also been taken into consideration. The German liberal movement has, since Bismarckian times, been divided into two rival sections, namely "national liberalism" (right wing) and "progressive liberalism" (left wing). After the Second World War it seemed that for the first time in nearly a century both wings were to be united in one political structure namely the FDP. It seemed as if the rapid decline of' Liberalism since the turn of the century had at last been checked, factionalism eliminated and greater unity achieved. Factional rivalries, however, reappeared and caused serious strains on the FDP's internal unity and political efficiency. Basically it was a struggle to achieve an exact position for the FDP in the political spectrum: right of the CDU by uniting all nationalistic forces or as a middle party between the CDU and SPD. The first alternative ruled out the possibility of a coalition with the SPD, while the second kept [...] ...|$|R

[...] In regards to the compromise that gave the free trade loving Slaveocracy the reigns of the economy, the free trade tariff of 1833, Seaman stated that it gave the U.S.A unbridled completion with a plethora of foreign commodities that supplanted domestic goods causing for Americans to be idle. They were driven to engage in agriculture. Free trade had ruined the division of employments/diversiity of employments that protectionism gave the country.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} the strategic {{use of public}} policy {{as a tool for}} reshaping public opinion. In the 1990 s, “progressive revisionists ” argued that, by reforming welfare, liberals could <b>free</b> the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of a significant electoral liability, reduce the race-coding of poverty politics, and produce a public more willing to invest in anti-poverty efforts. Connecting this argument to recent scholarship on policy feedback, we pursue a quantitative case study of the potential for new policies to move public opinion. Our analysis reveals that welfare reform in the 1990 s produced few changes in mass opinion. To explain this result, we propose a general framework for the analysis of mass feedback effects. After locating welfare as a “distant-visible ” case in this framework, we advance four general propositions that shed light on our case-specific findings as well as the general conditions under which mass feedback effects should be viewed as more or less likely. *For helpful comments and advice on earlier versions of this material, w...|$|R

5000|$|As West Germany was reorganised {{and gained}} {{independence}} from its occupiers, the German Democratic Republic {{was established in}} East Germany in 1949. The creation of the two states solidified the 1945 division of Germany.

This was turned down; reunification was not a priority for the leadership of West Germany, and the NATO powers declined the proposal, asserting that Germany should be able to join NATO and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation.

The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred greater job security. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term liberalism in the United States today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism. In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by socialist or social democratic parties such as the British Labour Party rather than liberal parties. As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the <b>Free</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in Germany being one example. The Liberal Democrats in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries liberalism or neoliberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, {{liberalism}} has a {{long tradition}} dating back to 17th century. Scholars often split those traditions into British and French versions, with the former version of liberalism emphasising the expansion of democratic values and constitutional reform and the latter rejecting authoritarian political and economic structures, as well as being involved with nation-building. The continental French version was deeply divided between moderates and progressives, with the moderates tending to elitism and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as universal suffrage, universal education and the expansion of property rights. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism. A prominent example of these divisions is the German <b>Free</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> which was historically divided between national liberal and social liberal factions.|$|E

The result was so close, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the <b>Free</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship.
