5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> move to Winnipeg where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{announced}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> work {{on keeping}} his weight down {{prior to the}} 1907 season, but announced his intentions to retire in February 1907. In March 1907, he announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return, but not at a pay cut. He signed a new contract two weeks into the 1907 season, in which he went 10–10.|$|E
5|$|Cycling was {{supported}} by both Berry and Pidgeon. Goldsmith said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> judge Cycle Superhighways by their effect. Khan said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> continue to invest in them.|$|E

6000|$|In despair, Tom {{went off}} to Elsley Vavasour. <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> help? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> join, as one of two householders, in making a {{representation}} to the proper authorities? ...|$|R
5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter <b>he</b> <b>would</b> commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home <b>he</b> <b>would</b> again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Raonic was {{questioned}} about whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{follow the example}} of Rusedski, the last prominent Canadian tennis player, who decided to represent Great Britain instead. Raonic declared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play for Canada.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year <b>he</b> <b>would</b> gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr never heeded {{him or his}} stare; nor, had <b>he</b> done so, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> {{have known}} who it was that looked at him from behind the make-up of Scaramouche; nor, again, had <b>he</b> known, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> {{have been in the}} least troubled or concerned.|$|R
6000|$|And if she did, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> {{acknowledge}} her? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> be able {{to acknowledge}} her through everything, or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> use her just as his instrument, use her for his own private satisfaction, not admitting her? That was what the other men had done. They had wanted their own show, {{and they would not}} admit her, they turned all she was into nothingness. Just as Hermione now betrayed herself as a woman. Hermione was like a man, she believed only in men's things. She betrayed the woman in herself. And Birkin, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> acknowledge, or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> deny her? ...|$|R
60|$|Sam said <b>'e</b> <b>would,</b> and arter {{they had}} 'ad another drink {{together}} the tec shifted 'is seat alongside of 'im and talked in his ear.|$|R
5|$|Gallagher {{was born}} in New Brunswick in 1854, {{the son of an}} Irish {{immigrant}} father. After attending the schools of his birthplace, he moved west to Winnipeg with his family, and became involved in the family meat packing business, established by his father. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> soon move west again to what would later become the province of Saskatchewan, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> continue his business, providing his product to the local police establishments and soldiers during the North-West Rebellion. After his contracts expired there, Gallagher would move again further west, to Edmonton, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> permanently settle.|$|E
5|$|George {{objected to}} the anti-Catholic wording of the Accession Declaration that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be {{required}} to make {{at the opening of}} his first parliament. He made it known that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> refuse to open parliament unless it was changed. As a result, the Accession Declaration Act 1910 shortened the declaration and removed the most offensive phrases.|$|E
5|$|Hašek's injury {{caused him}} to miss {{the rest of the}} regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return in time for the playoffs. He said that if he were to be re-signed, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the heart}} of the {{seamstress}} doubt and fear were being slowly knit into dread of the first sound to pass her husband's lips. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> ask? How should she answer? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> talk wild, or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> talk sensible? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> have forgotten that young girl, or had he nursed and nourished his wicked fancy in the house of grief and silence? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> ask where the baby was? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> speak a kind word to her? But alongside her dread there was guttering within her the undying resolution not to 'let him go from her, if it were ever so, to that young girl.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Arry said <b>'e</b> <b>would,</b> {{and then}} <b>he</b> stood {{on one side}} to let 'im pass, and even put the knobby stick under 'im to help 'im up the companion-ladder.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's master!" [...] she gasped. [...] "Oh, 'ow 'e frightened me! If you {{had seen}} 'is eyes, Mr. Colmore, sir. I thought <b>'e</b> <b>would</b> 'ave been {{the death of}} me." ...|$|R
5|$|He {{returned}} to Mongolia in October 2008, staying until {{shortly before the}} tournament in Kyushu in November, {{which he did not}} enter. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not withdraw for a third time partway through a tourney, and suggested that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> retire if his comeback proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> bet on anything—perhaps {{he was the}} {{original}} of the saying about flies crawling up the window. Waiting on a railway line <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bet on how many trains would pass through the opposite platform. how may carriages {{would be on the}} next one, how many carriage windows would be open. In a train <b>he</b> <b>would</b> produce a brass top stamped Put and Take—he paid or collected according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Johnson {{confirmed}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be working with}} DC Entertainment for an untitled film project. In September 2014, {{it was announced that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play Black Adam, the villain, in a film about Shazam {{as a part of the}} DC Extended Universe; which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> also produce.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mistake o' Bill's,' ses 'Arry, {{pointing}} to me. 'I told 'im I thought 'e was wrong, but <b>'e</b> <b>would</b> 'ave it. I've {{got a bad}} memory, so I left it to 'im.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But for Christian {{the hours}} were a long {{nightmare}} {{of grief and}} shame, fear and anger. <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> forgive? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> be true to her? Or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> go away without a word? Since yesterday {{it was as if}} she had stepped into another world, and lost it again. In place of that new feeling, intoxicating as wine, what was coming? What bitter; dreadful ending? ...|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, Chambers revealed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> depart the serial {{at the conclusion of}} his contract in late 2017 due to a prior commitment. He explained that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be touring with a musical, which disappointed show bosses, but would return to the show {{at the conclusion of the}} tour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have a meal. Following the meal <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home <b>he</b> <b>would</b> drink two cups of tea, {{and go to bed}} at midnight.|$|E
5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, lad: did {{you ever}} hear of a wolf that could live without marauding? Or if <b>he</b> tried, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> get credit for so doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But--just the same, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> really {{ever get}} to England alive? And if <b>he</b> did, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> {{have to go on}} holding his breath in terror for nine more days? Would the fo'c'sle always keep heaving up--up--up, like this, then down--down--down, as though it were going to sink? ...|$|R
60|$|His anxiety at {{this crisis}} {{continued}} to be great. Everything depended on {{the result of the}} Bishop's self-communion. <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> not come the next day? Perhaps instead of his important presence there would appear a letter postponing the visit indefinitely. If so, all would be lost.|$|R
5|$|Off the field, Miller was {{dogged by}} {{speculation}} {{as to whether}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, which would have ended his Test career. Miller resolved that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, but kept his decision private.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> try {{to qualify for}} the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not swim the 400m, claiming <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 2010, Wilders {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{take a seat}} on the Hague city council, after it became clear he won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not take up a seat if he won.|$|E
6000|$|How <b>would</b> <b>he</b> greet her? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> {{be exactly}} as he was when they {{stood at the edge}} of Tod's orchard, above the dreamy, darkening fields, joining hands and lips, moved as they had never been moved before? ...|$|R
6000|$|Was he--Mr. Ledbetter--really, after all, so brave as <b>he</b> assumed? <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> {{really be}} so {{pleased to have}} railways, policemen, and {{security}} vanish suddenly from the earth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But surely,' put in Merevale again, 'surely Thomson {{would be}} the last boy to do such a thing. Why should <b>he?</b> What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> gain by it?' ...|$|R
