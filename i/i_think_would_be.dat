500|$|After {{these shows}} were completed, Gorham {{confirmed}} that extended Thin Lizzy tours were probably {{a thing of}} the past, but that the band would continue to perform in one-off events. He stated, [...] "To kill it off stone dead <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the wrong thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been [...] "very adamant" [...] that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added [...] "There is a bond there that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The London Government Act 1899 {{abolished}} the existing local authorities within the County of London and {{replaced them with}} 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster [...] to City of Westminster. This was intended to give [...] "recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it [...] "must necessarily disappear altogether". The amendment was rejected by the government, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be [...] "an anomaly which, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations". The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that [...] "as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII". Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of [...] "city" [...] to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I think that the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's a good way to deal with it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good model for other states to have.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Old Saltoun, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a joke. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{an exceedingly}} serious and sensible idea." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not to {{be a good}} man," [...] said I, [...] "but only a good {{specimen}} of some sort of man. That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the outcome of Emerson's 'Representative Men,' or of those most tragic 'Memoirs of Margaret Puller Ossoli.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not that}} they wanted outer {{conformity}} to certain needs and standards--that, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a reasonable thing enough to demand--but {{they wanted me to}} subdue my most private thoughts to their ideals.

6000|$|... "We might, perhaps, after all, {{make a few}} {{inquiries}} about--our relation Mr. Henchard," [...] whispered Mrs. Newson who, {{since her}} entry into Casterbridge, had seemed strangely weak and agitated, [...] "And this, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{a good place for}} trying it--just to ask, you know, how he stands in the town--if he is here, as I think he must be.

6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good plan, Stephen," [...] Geoffrey said suddenly. [...] "You see, {{there is plenty of}} spare line down here; if we wait until they are all asleep we can go round and tie their legs together, or put ropes round their ankles and fasten them to ring bolts.
