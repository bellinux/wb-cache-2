40|$|We {{theoretically}} prove a multifunctional photonic differentiation (<b>DIFF)</b> scheme {{based on}} phase demodulation using two cascaded linear filters. The photonic <b>DIFF</b> has a diversity of output forms, such as 1 st order intensity <b>DIFF,</b> 1 st order field <b>DIFF</b> and its inversion, 2 nd order field <b>DIFF,</b> dependent on the relative shift between the optical carrier and the filter's resonant notches. As a proof, we also experimentally demonstrate the <b>DIFF</b> diversity using a phase modulator and two delay interferometers (DIs). The calculated average deviation is less than 7 % for all <b>DIFF</b> waveforms. Our schemes show the advantages of flexible <b>DIFF</b> functions and forms, which may have different optical applications.

40|$|Two {{quantitative}} tests <b>DIFF</b> 1 and <b>DIFF</b> 2 {{for measuring}} goodness-of-fit between two locally-normalized supernova spectra are presented. Locallynormalized spectra are obtained by dividing a spectrum {{by the same}} spectrum smoothed over a wavelength interval relatively large compared to line features, but relatively small compared to continuum features. <b>DIFF</b> 1 essentially measures the mean relative difference between the line patterns of locally-normalized spectra and <b>DIFF</b> 2 is <b>DIFF</b> 1 minimized by a relative logarithmic wavelength shift between the spectra: the shift is effectively an artificial relative Doppler shift. Both <b>DIFF</b> 1 and <b>DIFF</b> 2 measure the physical similarity of line formation, and thus of supernovae. <b>DIFF</b> 1 puts more weight on overall physical similarity of the supernovae than <b>DIFF</b> 2 because the <b>DIFF</b> 2 shift compensates somewhat for some physical distinction in the supernovae. Both tests are useful in ordering supernovae into empirical groupings for further analysis. We present some examples of locally-normalized spectra for Type IIb supernova SN 1993 J with some analysis of these spectra. The UV parts {{of two of the}} SN 1993 J spectra are HST spectra that have not been published before. We also give an example of fitted locally-normalized spectra and, {{as an example of the}} utility of <b>DIFF</b> 1 and <b>DIFF</b> 2, some preliminary statistical results for hydrogen-deficient core-collapse (HDCC) supernova spectra.

This course introduces classical and new {{results on the}} algebraic structure of the identity compo-nent of the diffeomorphism group <b>Diff</b> 0 (M) or homeomorphism group Homeo 0 (M) of a compact manifold. These groups are algebraically simple (no nontrivial normal subgroups) – for deep topological reasons due to Epstein, Mather, Thurston [...] . but nevertheless have a very rich algebraic structure.
