40|$|Ovine {{parturition}} {{results from}} {{an increase in}} foetal cortisol secretion in late gestation which is dependent on an intact hypothalamo-pituitary connection. The cortisol surge and parturition fails in hypothalamo-pituitary disconnected (HPD) <b>foetuses</b> but, paradoxically, immunoreactive (ir) -ACTH concentrations and secretory dynamics appear normal. This study compares the occurrence and timing of labour, basal ir-ACTH and cortisol concentrations and adrenal responsiveness in HPD <b>foetuses</b> (HPD/ACTH) receiving constant ACTH(1 - 24) infusion (43 ng/h/kg) from surgery (114 +/- 1 days gestational age (GA)) with those of saline-infused HPD or intact <b>foetuses</b> (HPD/SAL and INT/SAL). HPD/ACTH <b>foetuses</b> initiated labour at 147 +/- 2 days GA, which was {{not significantly different from}} INT/SAL <b>foetuses</b> (149 +/- 1 day GA). HPD/SAL <b>foetuses</b> were killed electively at 146 +/- 3 days GA with no signs of labour. Foetal ir-ACTH concentrations in all groups were indistinguishable, but only HPD/ACTH and INT/SAL <b>foetuses</b> had a significant cortisol surge. Adrenal responsiveness to ACTH(1 - 24) (1 microg/kg) was greater in HPD/ACTH <b>foetuses</b> than in HPD/SAL or INT/SAL <b>foetuses</b> at all GAs studied. Adrenal responsiveness in HPD/SAL <b>foetuses</b> exceeded that in INT/SAL <b>foetuses</b> at 120 and 130 days GA but did not change with GA. In summary, the basal cortisol and parturition defect in HPD <b>foetuses</b> was reversed by low-dose ACTH(1 - 24) infusion. Basal cortisol concentrations were unrelated to adrenal responsiveness. HPD/SAL <b>foetuses</b> had hyper-responsive adrenals compared to those of INT/SAL <b>foetuses</b> until 130 days GA, suggesting that the foetal hypothalamus exerts a negative influence on adrenal cortisol responses before 130 days GA, after which time stimulatory influences predominate. </p...|$|R

40|$|Excess {{ribonucleic acid}} ('RNA') {{is defined as}} the {{difference}} between the RNA contents of livers of pregnant and non-pregnant rats. Large amounts of excess RNA are formed in the liver of the rat during the last week of pregnancy. Excess RNA is formed in the liver after removal, on the 14 th or 15 th day of pregnancy, of the <b>foetuses,</b> or <b>foetuses</b> and ovaries, or <b>foetuses</b> and adrenals, or <b>foetuses,</b> ovaries and adrenals, or pituitary, or pituitary and <b>foetuses,</b> or pituitary, <b>foetuses</b> and ovaries. Viable placentae must be present. Two fractions of RNA appear to be present in the liver cells of pregnant rats. One fraction varies linearly with the protein content of the liver cells, as does the RNA of non-pregnant rats' livers. The second fraction (excess RNA) is quite independent of the protein content of the liver cells but varies linearly with the weight of the placentae and the energy, but not the protein, content of the diet. Hypophysectomy lowers the amount of excess RNA by 20 - 25 %. After removal of the <b>foetuses</b> on the 14 th day, the placentae do not attain the normal weight, and the amount of excess RNA is smaller than in normal pregnancy. After removal of <b>foetuses</b> and ovaries the placentae are larger and heavier than after removal of the <b>foetuses</b> alone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV 1) {{has been}} {{described}} as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the PK- 15 cell line. Several experimental infections with PCV 1 failed to reproduce disease in pigs. Therefore, PCV 1 is generally accepted as non-pathogenic to pigs. To our knowledge, nothing is known about the outcome of PCV 1 infections in porcine <b>foetuses.</b> This was examined in the present study. Results Nine <b>foetuses</b> from three sows were inoculated at 55 days of gestation: three with 10 4. 3 TCID 50 of the PCV 1 cell culture strain ATCC-CCL 33, three with 10 4. 3 TCID 50 of the PCV 1 field strain 3384 and three with cell culture medium (mock-inoculated). At 21 days post-inoculation, all 6 PCV 1 -inoculated and all 3 mock-inoculated <b>foetuses</b> had a normal external appearance. Microscopic lesions characterized by severe haemorrhages were observed in the lungs of two <b>foetuses</b> inoculated with CCL 33. High PCV 1 titres (up to 10 4. 7 TCID 50 /g tissue) were found in the lungs of the CCL 33 -inoculated <b>foetuses.</b> All other organs of the CCL 33 -inoculated <b>foetuses</b> and all the organs of the 3384 -inoculated <b>foetuses</b> were negative (1. 7 TCID 50 /g tissue) by virus titration. PCV 1 -positive cells (up to 121 cells/ 10 mm 2 in CCL 33 -inoculated <b>foetuses</b> and up to 13 cells/ 10 mm 2 in 3384 -inoculated <b>foetuses)</b> were found in the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, thymus and tonsils. PCR and DNA sequencing of Rep recovered CCL 33 or 3384 sequences from CCL 33 - or 3384 -inoculated <b>foetuses,</b> respectively. Conclusions From this study, it can be concluded that cell culture PCV 1 can replicate efficiently and produce pathology in the lungs of porcine <b>foetuses</b> inoculated at 55 days of foetal life. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{studies have}} found that stress before or during {{pregnancy}} is linked to an increased incidence of behavioural disorders in offspring. However, few studies have investigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and the serotonergic system as a consequence of pregestational stress. In the present study, we investigated the effect of pre-gestational stress on HPA axis activity in maternal rats and their <b>foetuses</b> and examined whether changes in HPA axis activity of maternal rats produced functional changes in the serotonergic system in the brain of <b>foetuses.</b> Results We used the behavioural tests to assess the model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in maternal rats. We found the activity in the open field and sucrose consumption was lower for rats with CUS than for the controls. Body weight but not brain weight was higher for control <b>foetuses</b> than those from the CUS group. Serum corticosterone and corticotrophin-releasing hormone levels were significantly higher for mothers with CUS before pregnancy and their <b>foetuses</b> than for the controls. Levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) were higher in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of <b>foetuses</b> in the CUS group than in the controls, and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) levels were lower in the hippocampus in <b>foetuses</b> in the CUS group than in the control group. Levels of 5 -HIAA in the hypothalamus did not differ between <b>foetuses</b> in the CUS group and in the control group. The ratio of 5 -HIAA to 5 -HT was significantly lower for <b>foetuses</b> in the CUS group than in the control group. Levels of 5 -HT 1 A receptor were significantly lower in the foetal hippocampus in the CUS group than in the control group, with {{no significant difference in the}} hypothalamus. The levels of serotonin transporter (SERT) were lower in both the foetal hippocampus and foetal hypothalamus in the CUS group than in the control group. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that pre-gestational stress alters HPA axis activity in maternal rats and their <b>foetuses,</b> which is associated with functional changes in 5 -HT activity (5 -HT, 5 -HIAA and ratio of 5 -HIAA to 5 -HT), as well as the levels of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor and SERT in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of <b>foetuses.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} the effects of breed and sex on growth patterns and metabolic features of advanced-pregnancy <b>foetuses</b> exposed to the same environmental conditions. Thus, at Day 62 of pregnancy, swine <b>foetuses</b> from an obese breed with leptin resistance (Iberian breed) were compared to lean crossbred <b>foetuses</b> (25 % Large White × 25 % Landrace × 50 % Pietrain). There were differential developmental patterns in <b>foetuses</b> with leptin resistance, mainly a higher relative weight of the brain resembling "brain-sparing effect". Prioritization of brain growth may be protective for the adequate growth and postnatal survival of the Iberian individuals, an ancient breed reared in extensive semi-feral conditions for centuries. There were also clear sex-related differences in foetal development and metabolism in the Iberian breed. Female Iberian <b>foetuses</b> were similar in size and weight to male littermates but had a significantly higher relative liver to body weight ratio resembling "liver-sparing effect" and a trend for a higher relative intestine to body ratio. Moreover, the availability of triglycerides, cholesterol and IL- 6 in female Iberian <b>foetuses</b> was similar to that of lean crossbred <b>foetuses.</b> Overall, these features may favour a better postnatal survival and development of females, the sex more critical for the species survival.

40|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{concerns}} that antenatal corticosteroids, which are administered to women {{at high risk}} of delivering preterm to reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, have adverse effects on foetal brain development and subsequent effects on behaviour and learning, when administered as repeated courses. The present study aimed to examine whether repeated betamethasone treatment alters the expression of the key-rate limiting enzyme, 5 α-reductase, in the synthetic pathway of the potent neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in the brain and placenta and whether this effect is potentiated in growth restricted <b>foetuses.</b> To investigate this, pregnant guinea pigs carrying either control (sham surgery) or growth-restricted <b>foetuses</b> were treated with vehicle or betamethasone (1 mg/kg/day) for 4 days prior to sacrifice (65 d). Placental insufficiency was induced by the ablation of uterine artery branches supplying each placenta at mid gestation, resulting in foetal growth restriction characterised by ‘brain sparing’. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine relative 5 α-reductase type 1 and 2 mRNA expression in the placenta and brain. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the subcortical white matter, CA 1 and dentate regions of the hippocampus. 5 α-reductase type 2 mRNA expression in the brain was markedly reduced by betamethasone treatment in male <b>foetuses</b> compared to vehicle-treated controls but not in female <b>foetuses.</b> In addition, 5 α-reductase type 1 expression in the brain was increased by growth restriction and/or betamethasone treatment in female <b>foetuses</b> but expression in males <b>foetuses</b> did not increase. 5 α-reductase type 2 expression in the placenta was markedly reduced by betamethasone treatment compared to vehicle-treated control. Intrauterine growth restriction and betamethasone treatment reduced GFAP expression in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus in the brains of male but not female <b>foetuses.</b> These data indicate that betamethasone treatment suppresses placental expression and has sexually dimorphic effects on expression of neuroactive steroid synthetic enzymes in the brain. These actions may lead to adverse effects on the developing brain, particularly in male <b>foetuses,</b> such as the observed effects on GFAP expression...|$|R
