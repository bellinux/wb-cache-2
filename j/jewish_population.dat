5|$|Depending on {{religious}} definitions and varying population data, the United States currently has {{the second largest}} Jewish community in the world (after Israel). The American <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> {{was estimated to be}} approximately 5,128,000 (1.7%) of the total population in 2008 (304,060,000). However, it may be as high as 6,444,000 (2.2%). As a contrast, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the Israeli <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> was 5,435,800 in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Genetic {{studies have}} often {{produced}} conflicting {{results on the}} question of whether distant <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> in different geographic locations share greater genetic similarity to each other or instead, to nearby non-Jewish populations. We perform a genome-wide population-genetic study of <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations,</b> analyzing 678 autosomal microsatellite loci in 78 individuals from four Jewish groups together with similar data on 321 individuals from 12 non-Jewish Middle Eastern and European populations. Results We find that the <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> show a high level of genetic similarity to each other, clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure. Further, Bayesian clustering, neighbor-joining trees, and multidimensional scaling place the <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> as intermediate between the non-Jewish Middle Eastern and European populations. Conclusion These results support the view that the <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> largely share a common Middle Eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with non-Jewish populations of European descent. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{military}} campaign to remove certain classes of persons (above all, Jews) from Germany and other German-held territories during World War II, often with extreme brutality, {{is known as}} the Holocaust. It was carried out primarily by German forces and collaborators, German and non-German. Early in the war, millions of Jews were concentrated in urban ghettos. In 1941 Jews were , and by December Hitler had decided to exterminate all Jews living in Europe at that time. The European <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> was reduced from 9,740,000 to 3,642,000; the world's <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> was reduced by one-third, from roughly 16.6 million in 1939 to about 11 million in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. He argued that Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>population.</b> A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|Adherents of {{many other}} {{religions}} reside predominantly in the urban centers of Texas. In 1990, the Islamic population was about 140,000 with more recent figures putting the current number of Muslims between 350,000 and 400,000. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> is around 128,000. Around 146,000 adherents of religions such as Hinduism and Sikhism live in Texas. It is the fifth-largest Muslim-populated state in the country.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1920, and {{continuing}} until the 1960s, McGill imposed a controversial quota which specified a maximum on {{the proportion of}} newly admitted students who were Jewish. Up until that point Jews had been overrepresented in the university, especially in the arts (20% Jewish) and law (40% Jewish). The quota limited the <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> across McGill to at most 10%.|$|E
5|$|Following Alexander the Great's {{death in}} 323BCE, Judea was contested between the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia. Seleucid emperor AntiochusIII's victory over Egypt in the Battle of Panium brought Judea under Seleucid control. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris, the {{fortified}} base of Jerusalem's Egyptian garrison. Their support {{was rewarded with}} a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including barring foreigners and impure animals from the Temple's precincts, and an allocation of official funds {{for the maintenance of}} certain religious rituals in the Temple. Despite being allowed religious freedom, many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement, and this {{led to the formation of}} Hellenistic elites among the <b>Jewish</b> <b>population.</b> Hellenization produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture.|$|E

5|$|George Koval's father, Abram Koval, {{left his}} home town of Telekhany in Belarus to immigrate to the United States in 1910. Abram, a carpenter, settled in Sioux City, Iowa, which {{at the turn of}} the 20th century was home to a {{sizeable}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> of merchants and craftsmen. He and his wife Ethel Shenitsky Koval raised three sons: Isaya, born 1912; George (or Zhorzh), born Christmas 1913; and Gabriel, born 1919.|$|E
5|$|Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Lithuania, Bohemia, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Latvia {{lost over}} 70 {{percent of their}} Jewish population; in Belgium, Romania, Luxembourg, Norway, and Estonia the figure was about 50 percent. Over one-third of the Soviet Union's Jews were killed; France lost about 25 percent of its <b>Jewish</b> <b>population,</b> Italy between 15 and 20%. Denmark {{evacuated}} nearly all its Jews to nearby, neutral Sweden; the Danish resistance movement, {{with the assistance of}} many Danish citizens, evacuated 7,220 of the country's 7,800 Jews by sea to Sweden in vessels ranging from fishing boats to private yachts. The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> to avoid capture by the Nazis. Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation were also affected by the Holocaust in Italian Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Japan, and China.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, the Home Army Operational Command's Office of Information and Propaganda {{set up a}} Section for Jewish Affairs, {{directed}} by Henryk Woliński. This section collected data about {{the situation of the}} <b>Jewish</b> <b>population,</b> drafted reports, and sent information to London. It also centralized contacts between Polish and Jewish military organizations. The Home Army also supported the Relief Council for Jews in Poland (codenamed Żegota) as well as the formation of organizations of Jewish resistance under Nazi rule in Poland. One Home Army member, Witold Pilecki, was the only person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. The information that he gathered proved crucial in convincing the Western Allies about the fate of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>population.</b> In 1942 the Home Army sent Jan Karski on a secret mission to personally carry the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the mostly disbelieving Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Before leaving, Karski visited the Warsaw Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1940, nearly 56,000 Jews {{were living}} in Belgium out of a {{population}} of roughly 8 million.

5|$|Membership dropped {{during the}} Great Depression, and the synagogue {{suffered}} financial hardship, but it recovered, and by 1941 had 1,100 member families. In 1950 the congregation built an adjoining school; {{at its peak}} its enrollment was almost 1,000. As neighborhood demographics changed in the late 20th century, and Brooklyn's <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> became more Orthodox, the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations.|$|E
5|$|Over {{time the}} synagogue appealed {{to a broader}} {{constituency}} than just Roumanian-American Jews. Nevertheless, membership declined during {{the latter half of}} the 20th century as the upwardly mobile <b>Jewish</b> <b>population</b> of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. First Roumanian-American was particularly affected: as it was an Orthodox congregation, in order to attend Sabbath services its members had to live within walking distance.|$|E

Burns and Egdahl note that during the Second World War different nations behaved differently towards their <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations.</b> The <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> of Bulgaria and Denmark survived whereas the majority of the <b>Jewish</b> <b>populations</b> in Slovakia and Hungary did not survive the Holocaust.
