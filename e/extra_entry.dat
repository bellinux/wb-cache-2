25|$|Further {{expansion}} of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with one <b>extra</b> <b>entry</b> from South Africa and new teams based in Argentina and Japan, saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group on table points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.|$|E

50|$|Ultra, meanwhile, entered five {{trucks in}} the event {{including}} Musgrave's #1. The first two trucks were the #2 truck, Ultra's other full-time truck piloted by Andy Houston, and the #7 Dodge Motorsports truck, their part-time truck driven by developmental driver Tyler Walker. In a move that was seen as setting up roadblocks for Musgrave, Ultra prepared two additional Dodge Rams numbered 10 and 27. The #10 truck was driven by Andy Houston's brother Marty, a member of Musgrave's pit crew who had not raced in two years. The #27 was driven by P.J. Jones, who had not run a Truck Series event in eight years and was largely employed as a road course ringer. The <b>extra</b> <b>entries</b> earned {{a huge amount of}} criticism from points leader Gaughan as well as fans and other drivers.|$|R
50|$|For {{every year}} until they turn 18, the {{eligible}} tributes' names are entered an additional time. All {{of the names}} are written on slips of paper {{and placed in a}} glass bowl, from which the tributes are drawn by the announcer. Since many families live in poverty, one may be able to receive additional tesserae (one person's meagre supply of grain and oil for a year) in exchange for extra entries in the reaping. Therefore, for each tessera, one <b>extra</b> <b>entry</b> is placed in the reaping ball. For example, if a family has three members, a 12-year-old child could opt to take three extra tesserae: two for their family members and one for themselves; thus their name would be entered four times (one is the required entry, and the extra three are for each tessera). Since all entries are cumulative, if the citizen keeps taking the extra tesserae yearly, they would have their names entered 20 times by the age of 16, 24 by the age of 17, and finally 28 times by the time they are 18.|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} role of credit {{constraints}} on export, import, and two-way trade activities of European manufacturing firms. Using direct financial constraints indicators and accounting for endogeneity issues, we find that credit rationing significantly reduces both the probability of entering foreign markets and the intensive margins of trade. Empirical results {{also point out that}} {{the role of}} <b>extra</b> <b>entry</b> costs differs according to the location of foreign markets and to the type of imported goods and services. Conditional on trading in the European Union, rationing is not an obstacle to entering additional exporting and importing markets, even though two-way traders behave differently and are negatively affected by financial constraints when they enter non-EU markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom in the auction design literature is that 8 ̆ 5 rst price sealed bid auctions {{tend to make}} more money while ascending auctions tend to be more e ¢ cient. We re-examine these issues in an environment in which bidders are allowed to endogenously choose in which auction format to participate. Our 8 ̆ 5 ndings are that more bidders choose to enter the ascending auction than the 8 ̆ 5 rst price sealed bid auction and this <b>extra</b> <b>entry</b> is enough to make up the revenue di¤erence between the formats. Consequently, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that both formats raise approximately the same amount of revenue. They also generate e ¢ ciency levels and bidder earnings that are roughly equivalent across mechanisms though the earnings in the ascending might be slightly higher...|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{measured}} {{the time course of}} sodium entry during action potentials of mouse central neurons at 37 °C to examine how efficiently sodium entry is coupled to depolarization. In cortical pyramidal neurons, sodium entry was nearly completely {{confined to the}} rising phase of the spike: only ∼ 25 % more sodium enters than the theoretical minimum necessary for spike depolarization. However, in fast-spiking GABAergic neurons (cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical interneurons), twice as much sodium enters as the theoretical minimum. The <b>extra</b> <b>entry</b> occurs because sodium channel inactivation is incomplete during the falling phase of the spike. The efficiency of sodium entry in different cell types is primarily a function of action potential shape and not cell-type-specific differences in sodium channel kinetics. The narrow spikes of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons result in incomplete inactivation of sodium channels; this reduces metabolic efficiency but likely enhances the ability to fire spikes at high frequency...|$|E
40|$|The papyrus is incomplete, {{the bottom}} is missing. Traces of a few faded letters of a {{previous}} text are recognizable e. g. in l. 2. The hand is a rather practiced semi-cursive, which {{can be compared to}} P. Prag. I 45 (522), P. Oxy. LXXII 4913 (462) and P. Oxy. LXVIII 4700 (504). These parallels support a date to {{the second half of the}} 5 th or the beginning of the 6 th century. The Coptic l. 11 appears to have been written with slightly larger and heavier letters, yet the extant text does not offer adequate basis for telling whether a different scribe was involved, or whether the same scribe is using a different graphic style. Double oblique strokes are employed to divide units in the account. The back is blank. The papyrus preserves the account of Phoibammon for expenses paid to the carpenter(s) (l. 6 – 9), for a window (l. 11), and for unknown purposes in the months of Phamenoth and Pharmouthi. The scribe started with registering three keratia up to Phamenoth 28, followed by a fourth on an unknown day of Phamenoth (l. 9), which he indicated also by adding l. 5 to the title, and then he continued with three extra entries in Pharmouthi. The second line, which was also added subsequently, might sum up ll. 10 – 12, in which case the account is complete, or it might constitute an <b>extra</b> <b>entry.</b> The most remarkable feature of this account is the insertion of one item (ϩⲓ ϣⲱϣⲧ l. 11) in Coptic, which also breaks the organization principle of the lines (date fi rst). This unusual example of bilingualism within a text may result from the scribe not knowing the Greek word for window. A parallel case is P. Leid. Inst. XXV 79 (7 th cent.) [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Session: Matrix Factorization, Clustering and Probabilistic DataIn many applications, {{entities}} {{and their}} relationships {{are represented by}} graphs. Examples include the WWW (web pages and hyperlinks) and bibliographic networks (authors and co-authorship). A graph can be conveniently modeled by a matrix from which various quantitative measures are derived. Some example measures include PageRank and SALSA (which measure nodes’ importance), and Personalized PageRank and Random Walk with Restart (which measure proximities between nodes). To compute these measures, linear systems of the form Ax = b, where A is a matrix that captures a graph’s structure, need to be solved. To facilitate solving the linear system, the matrix A is often decomposed into two triangular matrices (L and U). In a dynamic world, the graph that models it changes with time and thus is the matrix A that represents the graph. We consider a sequence of evolving graphs and its associated sequence of evolving matrices. We study how LU-decomposition should be done over the sequence so that (1) the decomposition is efficient and (2) the resulting LU matrices best preserve the sparsity of the matrices A’s (i. e., the number of <b>extra</b> non-zero <b>entries</b> introduced in L and U are minimized.) We propose a cluster-based algorithm CLUDE for solving the problem. Through an experimental study, we show that CLUDE is about {{an order of magnitude}} faster than the traditional incremental update algorithm. The number of <b>extra</b> non-zero <b>entries</b> introduced by CLUDE is also about an order of magnitude fewer than that of the traditional algorithm.
