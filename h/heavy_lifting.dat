The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007.

5|$|The 1950–51 Ashes {{series was}} Australia's first home series in three years. In the opening match {{of the season}} for Victoria against the touring Englishmen, Johnston warmed up by scoring 30 and taking a total of 3/89, {{including}} the wickets of leading batsmen Compton and Hutton. In the First Test at Brisbane, England were caught on a sticky wicket and Johnston took 5/35, removing Reg Simpson, Washbrook, Evans, Compton and Arthur McIntyre, as England declared at 7/68. He then took 2/30 in the second innings, removing Evans and Compton {{for a second time}} as Australia won the match to take a 1–0 lead. In the Second Test at the MCG, Johnston took 2/28 and 4/26 as Australia scraped home by 28 runs, defending a target of only 179 on a cracked pitch. Johnston had quiet Third Test with only a total of 1/82 in an innings victory, but he returned to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide with 3/58 and 4/73 in a 274-run win. He did much of the <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> in the second innings, removing the top four English batsmen, Hutton, Simpson, Washbrook and Compton. Johnston struggled in the final Test with match figures of 1/91 as England won their only Test of the series. Johnston led the wicket takers list, with 22 at 19.18, as Australia took a 4–1 series triumph. Johnston had saved his best performances for the Tests; he managed only 19 wickets at 40.37 in eight matches for Victoria during the season, and never took more than two wickets in an innings. He was particularly unsuccessful against New South Wales, taking a total of 3/190 in two matches. Overall, he took 41 wickets at 29.00 for the season.|$|E

Work brigades made up of villagers brought in from rural Serbia provided most of the manual labour. Even high school and university student volunteers took part.

The upper stage is cryogenic with a propellant loading of 25 tonne (C-25). The vehicle has a lift-off mass of about 640 tonnes and be 43.43 metres tall. According to ISRO, the payload fairing has a diameter of 5 metres and a payload volume of 100 cubic metres. It will allow India to become less dependent on foreign rockets for <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{that are}} used to enhance back {{strength}} may also be used to prevent back injuries. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, transverse abdominus bracing, and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, it can mean that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight and to not work oneself past fatigue. Signs of fatigue include shaking, poor coordination, muscle burning and loss of the transverse abdominal brace. <b>Heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> should be done with the legs performing the work, and not the back.|$|E
25|$|For other {{operation}}s, such as diving and <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting,</b> {{there is}} a risk of damage or injuries. Depending on the risk, the operation is done in Class 2 or 3. This means at least three Position reference systems should be selected. This allows the principle of voting logic, so the failing PRS can be found. For this reason, there are also three DP control computers, three gyrocompasses, three MRU’s and three wind sensors on Class 3 ships. If a single fault occurs that jeopardizes the redundancy, i.e., failing of a thruster, generator or a PRS, and this cannot be resolved immediately, the operation should be abandoned as quickly as possible.|$|E
50|$|To {{transport}} <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> items special trucks or trailers (flatbeds) are used, {{which are}} especially suitable {{due to their}} large loading area and capacity.

Sealift is carried out by special <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> vessels which often possess own cranes for loading and discharging cargo. Transportation of <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> items ranks among the most challenging and complex services in logistics and is handled by specialized companies.|$|R

25|$|Assigning jobs in occupations {{that women}} had never held before was a {{daunting}} task. By social custom, working {{women did not}} work in the trades and rarely supervised men. Women worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops. In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the WR were available {{to pick up the}} slack. However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and do so in the shortest amount of time. After completing their Marine Corps indoctrination training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By {{the end of the war}} 9,641 members of the WR had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to let them try anything, except <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> and combat. The WR strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672. Of this number 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and 6 as unaccounted for. Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the WR. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields. The first duty posts and stations for the WR included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia. Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Paris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.|$|E
