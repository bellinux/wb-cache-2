25|$|For {{guidance}} regarding catheter positions {{during the}} examination, the physician mostly relies on detailed knowledge of internal anatomy, <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> and catheter behavior and intermittently, briefly uses fluoroscopy {{and a low}} X-ray dose to visualize when needed. This is done without saving recordings of these brief looks. When the physician is ready to record diagnostic views, which are saved and can be more carefully scrutinized later, he activates the equipment to apply a significantly higher X-ray dose, termed cine, {{in order to create}} better quality motion picture images, having sharper radiodensity contrast, typically at 30 frames per second. The physician controls both the contrast injection, fluoroscopy and cine application timing so as to minimize the total amount of radiocontrast injected and times the X-Ray to the injection so as to minimize the total amount of X-ray used. Doses of radiocontrast agents and X-ray exposure times are routinely recorded in an effort to maximize safety.|$|E
2500|$|During the Falklands War the Argentinian Type 209/1200 {{submarine}} [...] "San Luis" [...] {{performed a}} war patrol. [...] While {{on their way}} to the area assigned the fire control computer went out of order. The vessel continued on to the combat area, and managed to fire at least 3 wire guided SST-4 mod0 torpedoes at the British fleet. The torpedoes suffered from various issues, with the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> cut a minute after launch and the torpedoes going off the assigned course. After the war testing revealed that the torpedoes' electric gyroscopes had reversed polarity, which resulted in a complete refit of the entire Argentinean torpedo stock, and a conversion of a portion of this stock from Mod0 to Mod1, performed by the firm which produced these weapons (AEG). Beside the torpedo issue, [...] "San Luis" [...] patrolled mostly undetected.|$|E

Flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> have lesser complication rate of tissue injury as compared to stiff <b>guide</b> <b>wires.</b> Flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> are however more prone to bending and kinking due to their mechanical properties. We report an unusual complication of knotting of flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> during endourologic procedure and the trick to remedy this problem. We have also discussed the structural design and mechanical properties of commonly used <b>guide</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{retrograde}} pyelogram is done {{to locate}} the stone in the kidney. With a small 1 centimeter incision in the loin, the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCN) needle is passed into the pelvis of the kidney. The position of the needle is confirmed by fluoroscopy. A <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is passed through the needle into the pelvis. The needle is then withdrawn with the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> still inside the pelvis. Over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> the dilators are passed and a working sheath is introduced.A nephroscope is then passed inside and small stones taken out. In case the stone is big it may first have to be crushed using ultrasound probes and then the stone fragments removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{insertion}} point is cleanly shaved and sterilized. A local anesthetic is {{injected into the}} skin to numb the {{insertion point}}. A small puncture is then made with a needle in either the femoral vein in the groin or the radial vein in the wrist, before a <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is inserted into the venous puncture. A plastic sheath (with a stiffer plastic introducer inside) is then threaded over the wire and pushed into the vein (the Seldinger technique). The wire is then removed and the side-port of the sheath is aspirated to ensure venous blood flows back. It is then flushed with saline. Catheters are inserted using a long <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> and moved toward the heart. Once in position, the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is then removed.|$|E

50|$|Guide wires are {{an example}} of an {{application}} for biomedical coatings. Guide wires are used in coronary angioplasty to correct the effects of coronary artery disease, a disease that allows plaque build up {{on the walls of the}} arteries. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> guides the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls. Guide wires are commonly made from stainless steel or Nitinol and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the guide wire's movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.|$|E
50|$|Sinus surgery with {{balloons}} may {{be performed}} in a hospital, outpatient surgery setting or in the physician’s office under local anesthesia. The physician inserts a guide catheter through the nostril and near the sinus opening under endoscopic visualization. A flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is then introduced into the targeted sinus to confirm access. Most guide wires have a light on the tip which may produce light transmission seen through the skin to help the physician with correct placement of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire.</b> Once access to a blocked sinus is confirmed, a balloon catheter is advanced over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> and positioned in the blocked sinus opening for inflation. The balloon is inflated. If the procedure is successful, the sinus will remain open after the balloon is deflated and removed as the bone surrounding the sinus is permanently remodeled.|$|E

50|$|Fetendo {{intervention}} is less invasive than open fetal surgery.

50|$|Using an MRI {{to image}} the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> during use {{would have an}} {{advantage}} over using x-rays because the surrounding tissue can be examined while the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is advanced. Because most guide wires' core materials are stainless steel they are not capable of being imaged with an MRI. Nitinol wires are not magnetic and could potentially be imaged, but in practice the conductive nitinol heats up under the magnetic radiation which would damage surrounding tissues. An alternative that is being examined is to replace contemporary guide wires with PEEK cores, coated with iron particle embedded synthetic polymers.|$|E

40|$|Abbott Vascular {{manufactures}} medical <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> that {{consist of}} {{304 stainless steel}} wire joined to superelastic nickel titanium (Nitinol) wire by a solid-state resistance butt welding process. The objective of this project {{was to develop a}} deeper understanding of the mechanical properties of the welds in the <b>guide</b> <b>wires.</b> The wires tested were manufactured using two different processes and then ground to various diameters in the weld region. Vickers microhardness measurements were collected in the longitudinal direction across the heat-affected zones of the welds, as well as the transverse direction across the diameters of the welds. Micrographs of the welds produced by each of the two processes were generated in order to develop a fuller understanding of the where the indentations were relative to the flow of the welds. Wires with 304 stainless steel - Nitinol (NiTi) joints were tensile tested to determine if process type and grind diameter have affect ultimate tensile strength. Wires welded using Process A and ground to 0. 01252 ̆ 2 had a mean ultimate tensile strength of 192. 11 ksi, whereas these wires ground to 0. 00552 ̆ 2 had a mean ultimate tensile strength of 174. 68 ksi. Wires welded using Process B and ground to 0. 01252 ̆ 2 had a mean ultimate tensile strength of 179. 79 ksi, whereas Process B wires ground to 0. 00552 ̆ 2 had a mean ultimate tensile strength 158. 47 ksi.
