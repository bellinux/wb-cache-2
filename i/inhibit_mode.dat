40|$|Lighthill has {{suggested}} that magnetic fields can transform gravity waves into Alfvén waves. The behaviour of gravity waves in an incompressible and infinitely conducting atmosphere is examined so as to check this suggestion. It is found that an upgoing gravity wave is converted to a downgoing Alfvén wave and that this conversion is affected without any introduced atmospheric discontinuity. In the ionosphere dissipation is sufficient, save at very long wavelengths, to <b>inhibit</b> <b>mode</b> conversion but in the solar atmosphere the process may well operate. The energy necessary to heat the solar corona could possibly be supplied by gravity waves when dissipation occurs after the conversion to an Alfvén wave...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{capacity}} of the improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in railway wheel flat detection. Aiming at the mode mixing problem of EMD, an EMD energy conservation theory and an intrinsic mode function (IMF) superposition theory are presented and derived, respectively. Based on the above two theories, an improved EMD method is further proposed. The advantage of the improved EMD is evaluated by a simulated vibration signal. Then this method is applied to study the axle box vibration response caused by wheel flats, considering the influence of both track irregularity and vehicle running speed on diagnosis results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a test rig experiment. Research results demonstrate that the improved EMD can <b>inhibit</b> <b>mode</b> mixing phenomenon and extract the wheel fault characteristic effectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElbows {{have been}} widely used in the process industry, whose {{structure}} integrity is extremely important for the safety production. This paper aims to inspect the axial crack-like defects in 90 °elbows using T (0, 1) mode which has the constant group velocity. The elbow with a crack in the extrados and middle area is firstly studied by guided wave experiment. The propagation of guided wave in the bent pipe is then simulated by using finite element method. The results show that the rates of T (0, 1) mode passing through elbow correlate strongly with the excitation frequency. Less mode conversion is generated at the frequency of 38 kHz when passing through the elbow, while most of energy converted into F (1, 2) mode at the frequency of 75 kHz. The crack in different areas of the elbow can affect the rates of mode conversion. The crack {{in the middle of the}} elbow <b>inhibits</b> <b>mode</b> conversion which increases the detection sensitivity at the frequency of 38 kHz, while the crack in the extrados of elbow causes more mode conversion...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the two important parameters of pulse reversed current (PRC) technique, i. e. the pulse frequency (nu) and the cathodic duly cycle (theta), and {{of the presence of}} butyne- 2 -diol 1, 4 (BD) in a Watts type bath were examined, in nickel electrocrystallization. The fibre textures of nickel electrodeposits grown under specific conditions were studied by X-ray diffraction and the textural modifications were depicted in several diagrams. The addition of BD where the electrolyte pH is 4. 5, reinforces the inhibition phenomena occurring by the application of PRC, consuming the hydrogen produced during the electrodeposition; thus it causes a pH rise near the cathode, assists the formation of Ni(OH) 2 and leads to more <b>inhibited</b> <b>modes</b> of growth. A significant decrease of the pH (to 1. 5) inverts the phenomenon: the additive seems to hinder the inhibitors' action, acting itself like an inhibitor of the dissolution, thus the crystallites grow more uninhibited from the dissolution products and the most free modes of growth predominate over the others...|$|R

Consequently, lasing in high-threshold modes may be suppressed by strong low-threshold lasing modes. We numerically examine {{the effect of}} inherent noise on this strong nonlinear phenomenon. Noise generates emission below the lasing threshold and restrains the dramatic nonlinear behavior above threshold. The result is a linearization of random laser modes and is possible when noise overcomes spatial hole burning.

40|$|The {{addition}} of organic compounds to the electrolytic baths during the electrodeposition of metals affects {{the structure and}} {{the properties of the}} deposits, leading to the preparation of coatings with defined characteristics. In this work, a complete study of the action of the organic additives on the crystalline orientation of the nickel electrodeposits was carried out. The selection of the organic compounds was made in order to investigate the effect of the stereochemical structure and unsaturated bonds on the nickel electrocrystallization process. It was found that the presence of acetylenic compounds (butyne- 2 -diol 1, 4 and propyne- 2 -ol) in nickel plating baths leads to the predominance of high <b>inhibited</b> <b>modes</b> of crystal growth. Propyne- 2 -ol seems to be more active, as the geometry of its molecule favours the adsorption of the additive on the metallic surface and, thus, its faster hydrogenation. With the additon of phenyl propyl alcohol, a strong perturbation of the oriented crystal growth of the nickel crystallites occurs. The adsorption of the phenyl group on the metallic surface and its hydrogenation is responsible for the predominance of high inhibited textures. In the case of coumarin, the complexity of its molecule makes its adsorption more difficult, resulting in the development of [100] textured deposits even at high concentrations of the additive. Finally, when sodium benzene sulphonate or saccharin are added to the bath, the presence of sulphur in their molecules influences the nickel electrodeposition process through a different mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Low {{frequency}} distortion {{components of the}} output voltage of a cycloconverter are {{largely responsible for the}} restriction on its practical range: of frequencies, and the object of this thesis is to show that these components can be attenuated by the application of sampling techniques to the control system. After a general description of the operation and control of the cycloconverter, the distortion of the output waveform due to low frequency components is discussed. Under these circumstances, the fundamental repetition frequency of the waveform is less than the wanted output frequency, and two methods of determining it for given input and output frequencies are developed. The characteristics and properties of the low {{frequency distortion}} components, and the requirements for attenuating them are analysed. The particular effects on the magnitudes of these components due to operation of the cycloconverter in the <b>inhibited</b> <b>mode,</b> rather than the circulating-current mode, are examined and the requirements for attenuating them are identified. It is shown that the communications engineering processes of pulse width modulation and of natural sampling can be identified in the control of the cycloconverter. Regular sampling is more widely used in communications engineering, and its effect on the low frequency distortion components in the cycloconverter output is compared with natural sampling. A modified control method for the inhibited cycloconverter is then developed to attenuate these components. Digital computer programs were written to test the effect of introducing modifications to the control of the cycloconverter, and the more significant results are given in graphical and tabulated form. An experimental cycloconverter, with an inhibition control circuit designed for this project, was constructed to check the validity of the computer programs.

40|$|When expert {{operators}} {{interact with}} a new device, they inevitably reuse former interaction modes and actions. This phenomenon {{is due to the}} human cognition seeking resources savings. Schemas support this strategy and are implemented {{in such a way that}} perfection is disregarded at the profit of an intuitive trade-off between performance and cognitive resources savings. As a consequence, humans have a strong inclination to fit well-known solution procedures into new problems. For this reason, changes in work environments can cause accidents when they allow operators to interact {{with a new}} device if the latter is erroneously perceived as familiar. This research issue originates from an industrial background. The suspected cause of a fatal error performed by an operator in a steelworks factory is replicated in an experiment.

Maximal exercise capacity was determined by means of bicycle ergometry. Work load was increased in steps of 10 watts each minute.

There was an important increase in maximal exercise capacity when changing from VVI to VDT/I pacing. The extent of improvement was the same for patients {{above and below the}} age of 65 years. At comparable work loads VDT/I pacing resulted in significantly lower atrial rates than VVI pacing. Systolic time intervals did not differ between VVI and VDT/I pacing apart from an increase in left ventricular ejection time index with VDT/I pacing. Systolic time intervals and maximal exercise capacity with VVI pacing did not correlate with the increase in exercise capacity induced by VDT/I pacing.

Most HIV-infected infants acquire HIV through breastfeeding. Paradoxically, most infants breastfed by HIV-positive women do not become infected. This is potentially attributed to anti-HIV factors in breast milk. Breast milk of HIV-negative women can inhibit HIV infection. However, the HIV-inhibitory activity of breast milk fromHIV-positive mothers has not been evaluated. In addition, while significant differences in breast milk composition between transmitting and nontransmitting HIV-positive mothers have been correlated with transmission risk, the HIV-inhibitory activity of their breast milk has not been com-pared.

40|$|Recently, Finnish firms through {{government}} delegations to Nigerian {{have become}} more interested in investing in the Nigerian market. There are already quiet a number of Finnish SMEs exporting in the Nigerian market. Within these SMEs already in the Nigerian market, none presently have FDIs as there entry mode choice. Thus, the main goal {{of this study is}} to discuss the factors why Finnish SMEs in the Nigerian market do not have FDIs as their entry mode choice. First, the thesis examines the determinants of FDI (utilising the PESTL framework) in the Nigerian market as well as in the Chinese market within 1980 - 2000 and 2001 - 2010. This made it possible to correlate the determinants of FDIs within these periods and the time of entry of Finnish SMEs into Nigeria and the Chinese market. Thus, it provided a means to understand what was in place in the Chinese market why Finnish SMEs choose FDI and choose exporting for the Nigerian market. Second, the pattern of entry of Finnish SMEs was studied to understand the strategic process put in place internally in these firms for making decisions on entry mode choice. Third the study explored a host of external factors <b>inhibiting</b> entry <b>mode</b> choice such as perceived cultural distance, general environmental challenges and industry specific factors. Fourth, the study also examined a host of internal factors to the firms <b>inhibiting</b> entry <b>mode</b> choice such as degree of relevant international experience, orientation of business networks, firm size and nature of product offerings. This study was undertaken through extensive literature review on internationalisation and entry modes. The reasons for lack of FDIs in the Nigerian market among this Finnish SME were as follows: The FDI determinants in the Nigerian market at the time of entry of these firms were not adequate for their firms to opt for FDI and are still not adequate at the moment. The firm that choose FDIs in the Chinese market did that because the FDIs determinants were adequate to necessitate FDI entry mode choice. The result of the binary logistical regression analysis shows significantly that the reasons for lack of FDI in the Nigerian market are: (1) Firm Size, (2) Perceived cultural distance (3) Industry growth potential not adequate to attract FDIs (4) Business network not oriented towards the Nigerian market or West African in general (5) Insufficient relevant international experience needed for FDIs in the Nigerian market and Finally (6) high environmental uncertainty in the Nigerian market. /Kir 1...|$|R

We examined the mechanism of the thrombin-induced [Ca++]i increase in chick embryonic heart cells loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator, indo- 1. Thrombin (1 U/ml) increased both systolic and diastolic [Ca++]i from 617 +/- 62 and 324 +/- 46 to 1041 +/- 93 and 587 +/- 38 nM, respectively. An initial rapid [Ca++]i increase {{was followed by a}} more sustained increase. There were associated increases in contraction strength, beat frequency, and action potential duration. The [Ca++]i increase was not blocked by tetrodotoxin or verapamil, but was blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml). The thrombin-induced [Ca++]i increase was partly due to intracellular calcium release, since it persisted after removal of external calcium. The [Ca++]i increase in zero calcium was more transitory than in normal calcium and was potentiated by 10 mM Li+. Thrombin also induced influx of calcium across the surface membrane, which could be monitored using Mn++ ions, which quench indo- 1 fluorescence when they enter the cell. Thrombin-induced Mn++ entry was insensitive to verapamil, but was blocked by 2 mM Ni++. Thrombin increased inositol trisphosphates by 180 % at 90 s and this effect was also blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Conclusion: thrombin promotes calcium entry and release in embryonic heart cells even when action potentials are <b>inhibited.</b> Both <b>modes</b> of [Ca++]i increase may be coupled to the receptor by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rod outer segment {{membrane}} {{guanylate cyclase}} 1 (ROS-GC 1) {{is the original}} member of the membrane guanylate cyclase subfamily whose distinctive feature is that it transduces diverse intracellularly generated Ca 2 + signals in the sensory neurons. In the vertebrate retinal neurons, ROS-GC 1 is pivotal for the operations of phototransduction and, most likely, of the synaptic activity. The phototransduction- and the synapse-linked domains are separate, and they {{are located in the}} intracellular region of ROS-GC 1. These domains sense Ca 2 + signals via Ca 2 +-binding proteins. These proteins are ROS-GC activating proteins, GCAPs. GCAPs control ROS-GC 1 activity through two opposing regulatory modes. In one mode, at nanomolar concentrations of Ca 2 +, the GCAPs activate the cyclase and as the Ca 2 + concentrations rise, the cyclase is progressively <b>inhibited.</b> This <b>mode</b> operates in phototransduction via two GCAPs: 1 and 2. The second mode occurs at micromolar concentrations of Ca 2 + via S 100 â. Here, the rise of Ca 2 + concentrations progressively stimulates the enzyme. This mode is linked with the retinal synaptic activity. In both modes, the final step in Ca 2 + signal transduction involves ROS-GC dimerization, which causes the cyclase activation. The identity of the dimerization domain is not known. A heterozygous, triple mutation-E 786 D, R 787 C, T 788 M- in ROS-GC 1 has been connected with autosomal cone-rod dystrophy in a British family.

The {{aim of this}} study was to expand knowledge of the chemical-sensing capabilities of TRPC 5 by investigating dietary antioxidants. Human TRPC 5 channels were expressed in HEK 293 cells and studied by patch clamp and intracellular Ca 2 + recording. GFP- and HA-tagged channels were used to quantify plasma membrane localization. Gallic acid and vitamin C suppressed TRPC 5 activity if it was evoked by exogenous hydrogen peroxide or lanthanide ions but not by lysophosphatidylcholine or carbachol. Catalase mimicked the effects, suggesting that lanthanide-evoked activity depended on endogenous hydrogen peroxide. Trans-resveratrol, by contrast, <b>inhibited</b> all <b>modes</b> of TRPC 5, and its effect was additive with that of vitamin C, suggesting antioxidant-independent action. The IC 50 was ∼ 10 μm. Diethylstilbestrol, a related hydroxylated stilbene, inhibited TRPC 5 with a similar IC 50, but its action contrasted sharply with that of resveratrol in outside-out membrane patches where diethylstilbestrol caused strong and reversible inhibition and resveratrol had no effect, suggesting indirect modulation by resveratrol. Resveratrol did not affect channel surface density, but its effect was calcium-sensitive, indicating an action via a calcium-dependent intermediate. The data suggest previously unrecognized chemical-sensing properties of TRPC 5 through multiple mechanisms: (i) inhibition by scavengers of reactive oxygen species because a mode of TRPC 5 activity depends on endogenous hydrogen peroxide; (ii) direct channel blockade by diethylstilbestrol; and (iii) indirect, antioxidant-independent inhibition by resveratrol...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{prescribing}} practices of supplementary nurse prescribers (working in both {{primary and secondary}} care) who prescribe medicines for patients with skin conditions and the factors that facilitate or <b>inhibit</b> this <b>mode</b> of prescribing. BACKGROUND: Nurses work {{in a variety of}} roles, with varying levels of expertise, are involved in the treatment management of a broad range of skin diseases. Skin conditions are those for which independent nurse prescribers prescribe most frequently. The role of the nurse, limitations of the formulary and inter-professional relationships influence the prescribing practices of these nurses. There is no evidence currently available examining the impact and activity of supplementary nurse prescribing for patients with skin conditions. METHODS: A convenient sample of 580 nurses who prescribed for skin conditions and were qualified supplementary nurse prescriber, self-completed a written questionnaire. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty (89. 7 %) nurses were based in primary care and worked in general practice. Four hundred and thirty-six (75 %) held a degree level qualification or higher, 41 (7 %) had specialist dermatology training and 512 (88. 3 %) had more than 10 years postregistration nursing experience. Supplementary prescribing was used by a minority of nurses. Nurses who had specialist dermatology training used this mode of prescribing most frequently. Doctor and pharmacists lack of understanding of supplementary prescribing, lack of peer support and clinical management plans prevented the implementation of this mode of prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementary prescribing is used by a minority of nurses to treat skin conditions. A number of factors prevent nurses from using this mode of prescribing including lack of specialist training and lack of support in practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Specialist dermatology training, an understanding of supplementary prescribing by the members of the healthcare team, and support in practice are required if supplementary prescribing is to be implemented effectively for the treatment of skin conditions...|$|R
40|$|Anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 (B-cell {{lymphoma}} 2) proteins such as Bcl- 2 itself, Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1, prevent mitochondrial activation {{and thereby}} the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Since the avoidance of cell death {{is a prerequisite for}} malignant transformation, anti-apoptotic proteins are frequently overexpressed in tumor cells. Additionally, there is growing evidence that Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1 also play a role in other cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and autophagy induction, which can also be important for the onset and progression of cancer. One of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies worldwide is colorectal cancer. Even though improvements in treatment and population screenings have led to a decreased mortality in many countries, especially patients with metastasized colorectal cancer still face a poor prognosis. Until now, it has been an open question whether and to which extend anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins influence colorectal cancer initiation, progression and metastasation, with a few studies showing contradictory results. Hence, the purpose of this work was to shed more light on the role Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1 play for the maintenance of intestinal tissue homeostasis and for colorectal cancer development and outgrowth. First, their expression levels in the human intestinal mucosa as well as in adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissue were determined. This revealed a significant increase of Bcl-xL in the malignant state and an unaltered expression of Bcl- 2. By contrast, Mcl- 1 {{has been found to be}} significantly downregulated in colorectal cancer specimens. Results obtained in subsequent in vitro experiments clearly showed that Mcl- 1 has an anti-proliferative effect which cancer cells preclude by downregulation of the protein. Neither in intestinal epithelial cells nor in colorectal cancer cells has a cell cycle <b>inhibiting</b> <b>mode</b> of action been described so far for Mcl- 1. Additionally, further in vitro experiments have shown for the first time that the siRNA mediated silencing of anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins significantly decreased the migratory capacity and invasiveness of human colorectal cancer cells. In a second step, protein functions were studied in further detail in vivo. Since previous publications showed that the constitutive deletion of both Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1 induces embryonic lethality, two intestine-specific knockout mouse models were generated during this work. For the first time, they allowed to study functioning of Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1 in the murine intestine. The mouse models revealed a strong discrepancy between Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1, regarding their influence on tissue maintenance and tumorigenesis. While Bcl-xL turned out to be dispensable for normal tissue homeostasis, it has been found to be a crucial factor for colorectal cancer cell survival in a chemically induced tumor model. This confers Bcl-xL tumor-promoting properties and explains its overexpression in human adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The loss of Mcl- 1, by contrast, caused a severe intestinal phenotype, comprising high levels of cell death, an accompanying increase of proliferation and chronic inflammation. From an age of about six months, spontaneous tumorigenesis was observed in intestine-specific Mcl- 1 knockout mice which was promoted by the loss of the anti-proliferative effect Mcl- 1 exerts on intestinal epithelial cells and the inflammatory environment. Therefore, it has been proven that Mcl- 1 possesses tumor-suppressing properties in the intestine, what explains its downregulation in human colorectal cancer specimens. The presented results highly recommend the utilization of Mcl- 1 sparing inhibitors in the context of colorectal cancer treatment. A first step towards clinical application was done in this work by treating viable human colorectal cancer tissue ex vivo with the Bcl-xL/Bcl- 2 -specific inhibitor ABT- 737. Subsequent analyses revealed a significantly decreased viability of human colorectal cells in presence of the inhibitor. Since proliferation turned out to be unaltered under ABT- 737 treatment, inhibition of Bcl-xL in combination with classical chemotherapy could be an interesting approach for further studies with a focus on clinical applicability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Internet-based {{depression}} communities {{provide a}} forum for individuals to communicate and share information and ideas. There has been little research into the health status and other characteristics of users of these communities. Methods Online cross-sectional survey of Internet depression communities to identify depressive morbidity among users of Internet depression communities in six European countries; to investigate whether users were in contact with health services and receiving treatment; and to identify user perceived effects of the communities. Results Major depression was highly prevalent among respondents (varying by country from 40 % to 64 %). Forty-nine percent of users meeting criteria for major depression were not receiving treatment, and 35 % had no consultation with health services {{in the previous year}}. Thirty-six percent of repeat community users who had consulted a health professional in the previous year felt that the Internet community had been an important factor in deciding to seek professional help. Conclusions There are high levels of untreated and undiagnosed depression in users of Internet depression communities. This group represents a target for intervention. Internet communities can provide information and support for stigmatizing conditions that <b>inhibit</b> more traditional <b>modes</b> of information seeking. </p...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} report in a new program of research to evaluate the basic failure processes occurring in dense ceramics during projectile penetration, and, in particular, to study {{the role played by}} mechanical constraint in <b>inhibiting</b> some failure <b>modes.</b> In this contribution we describe a method for monitoring the response of selected ceramics to a highly localized pressure pulse under conditions of controlled constraint and distinguish the effect of constraint on the three primary failure modes : 1. Crushing, comminution and erosion in the zone of high compressive stress which exists near the contact surface between the projectile and the impacted ceramic. 2. Nucleation and propagation of a cone crack, predominantly in mode II (the shear stress mode) to form a ceramic plug ahead of the advancing projectile. 3. Fragmentation associated with radial (long-term) cracks nucleated and propagated by tensile stresses in the target material surrounding the contact zone. Constraint acts primarily to prevent the formation of a cone crack, allowing higher compressive stresses to be reached in the contact zone. At the levels of constraint studied so far, radial (tensile) cracks always terminate the failure process, releasing the compressive stresses in the contact zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrity}} and barrier properties of intestinal epithelium {{are determined by}} specialized adhesive structures known as intercellular junctions; composed of adherens junctions (AJs), tight junctions (TJs) and focal adhesions that mediate cell-cell and cell matrix interactions, respectively. These two types of epithelial cell adhesions regulate each other during disruption and restitution of the epithelial barrier. Inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are elevated during intestinal inflammation. The most notable effects of IFNγ and TNFα on intestinal epithelial homeostasis involve disruption of apical junctions and attenuation of cell migration. Although molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood, expressional downregulation of different adhesion proteins may {{play a major role}} in the cytokine-dependent disruption of the intestinal epithelial barriers. This thesis is based on the hypothesis that inhibition of the protein translation initiation machinery promotes the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and attenuates epithelial restitution during mucosal inflammation. This study was focused on two eukaryotic translation initiation factors, eIF 4 G 1 and eIF 4 G 2, which play essential roles in the regulation of cap-dependent protein translation. Expression of both translation initiation factors was dramatically downregulated in model intestinal epithelial cell monolayers treated with IFNγ and TNFα in parallel to cytokine-induced disruption of the epithelial barrier. siRNA or shRNA-mediated downregulation of either eIF 4 G 1, or eIF 4 G 2 increased permeability of well-differentiated SK-CO 15 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers and decreased expression of different adherens junction and tight junction proteins. Furthermore depletion of these translation initiating factors <b>inhibits</b> different <b>modes</b> of migration (wound healing and transfilter migration) of stem-cell like and well-differentiated intestinal epithelial cells. These findings suggest that eukaryotic translation initiation factors of the eIF 4 G family play unique roles in regulating {{integrity and}} restitution of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Downregulation of these translation initiating factors may mediate disruption of the intestinal epithelial barriers during mucosal inflammation...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} mono-, bis- and trisvinyl-pyridinium triphenylamines (TP-py) has been {{synthesised}} and evaluated for its one- and two-photon absorption (2 PA) induced-fluorescence properties under biological conditions. Interestingly, these compounds are only weakly fluorescent in water, whereas their fluorescence emissions are strongly restored (exaltation factors of 20 - 100) upon binding to double-stranded DNA. Additional measurements in glycerol {{indicate that the}} fluorescence increases {{are the result of}} immobilisation of the dyes in the DNA matrix, which <b>inhibits</b> rotational de-excitation <b>modes.</b> This particular feature is especially remarkable {{in the case of the}} bis and tris derivatives (TP- 2 py, TP- 3 py), which each display a high affinity (K(d) ~ microM) for dsDNA. TPIF measurements have shown that TP- 2 py and TP- 3 py each have a large 2 PA cross section (delta up to 700 GM) both in glycerol and in the presence of DNA, which ranks them amongst the best 2 PA biological fluorophores. Finally, one- and two-photon confocal imaging in cells revealed that these compounds perform red staining (lambda(em) = 660 - 680 nm) of nuclear DNA with excellent contrast. The remarkable optical properties of the TP-py series, combined with their high photostability and their easy synthetic access, make these compounds extremely attractive for use in confocal and 2 PA microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Compensatory {{endocytosis}} of exocytosed membrane {{and recycling}} of synaptic vesicle components {{is essential for}} sustained synaptic transmission at nerve terminals. At the ribbon-type synapse of retinal bipolar cells, manipulations expected to inhibit the interactions of the clathrin adaptor protein complex (AP 2) affect only the slow phase of endocytosis (� � 10 – 15 s), leading {{to the conclusion that}} fast endocytosis (� � 1 – 2 s) occurs by a mechanism that differs from the classical pathway of clathrin-coated vesicle retrieval from the plasma membrane. Here we investigate the role of endophilin in endocytosis at this ribbon synapse. Endophilin A 1 is a synaptically enriched N-BAR domain-containing protein, suggested to function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Internal dialysis of the synaptic terminal with dominant-negative endophilin A 1 lacking its linker and Src homology 3 (SH 3) domain <b>inhibited</b> the fast <b>mode</b> of endocytosis, while slow endocytosis continued. Dialysis of a peptide that binds endophilin SH 3 domain also decreased fast retrieval. Electron microscopy indicated that fast endocytosis occurred by retrieval of small vesicles in most instances. These results indicate that endophilin is involved in fast retrieval of synaptic vesicles occurring by a mechanism that can be distinguished from the classical pathway involving clathrin–AP 2 interactions...|$|R
