40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} better understand how uncertainty impacts a variety of economic activities and how to measure systemic risk. In the first chapter, "The effects of oil price uncertainty on the macroeconomy'' focuses on oil price uncertainty, and how it affects the global economic growth. In particular, I define oil price uncertainty as the time-varying standard deviation of one- quarter ahead forecasting error that follows stochastic volatility. Then I use a quarterly VAR with stochastic volatility in mean to {{examine the effect of}} oil price uncertainty. Stochastic volatility allows for the separation of effects of the oil price uncertainty from the level, and thus enables the examination of an oil price uncertainty shock in a flexible yet tractable way. One important contribution of this chapter is that it makes significant improvements in recovering an more accurate historical uncertainty series by incorporating a realized volatility series from daily oil price data to the main VAR as an additional oil price uncertainty indicator. The estimation result suggests that apart from the changes in oil price level, an oil price uncertainty shock alone has negative effects on both global and advanced economies' industrial production growth. Next I move on to the propagation of uncertainty in the financial sector of the economy in the second chapter, "Bank lending and loan securitization under uncertainty". This chapter analyzes how US commercial banks adjust lending activities in response to macroeconomic uncertainty with a focus on asset securitization. During 2001 Q 2 - 2009 Q 3, macroeconomic uncertainty has been negatively related to the loan growth rate. In addition, comparing banking institutions with and without asset securitization, I find that loan growth rate of asset-securitizing banks was not particularly protected from the increase in uncertainty, which implies that securitization did not effectively help transfer aggregate risk from the banking sector to investors. I postulate factors that {{may have contributed to the}} ineffective risk transfer of securitization; one important reason is due to the banks' credit exposure through explicit/implicit recourse and/or seller-provided credit enhancements which also fluctuate with the changes in the macroeconomic uncertainty level. My final dissertation chapter surveys the recent literature on the systemic risk measures in the purpose of better understanding the concept of systemic risk in relation with financial stability. In "Financial stability and systemic risk: a survey of systemic risk measure", I start from "model-free" measure of CoVaR, an extension of Value-at-Risk to quantify the contribution of an individual entity to systemic risk, that can be used and applied to practice very easily and flexibly. Then, I introduce GARCH-based measure, SRISK, whose main goal is to quantify the expected capital shortfall of a firm given that the financial sector is in distress. Next, I look at the measures rooted in the CDS pricing model, one of which attempts to capture systemic risk among sovereigns. Finally, I review the recent development that brings in the rare event, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> crisis, into the DSGE framework with the intermediary secto...|$|E

40|$|The {{consequences}} of the global financial crisis have changed {{the orientation of the}} regulators from the micro towards the macroeconomic level, which encompasses the financial system as a whole, with its components as individual financial institutions. Needless {{to say that there is}} an inherent risk to which every participant to the market is exposed, the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> Therefore, this paper aims at presenting <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in a clear manner, paying attention to and highlighting several approaches regarding <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in literature and practice. Moreover, the mechanism of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> transmission points out the channels through which <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> spreads and affects the real economy. There is also presented a new component of the macroprudential regulation, i. <b>e.</b> the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> buffer (SRB), which is an important instrument to fight against <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> along with the other buffers stipulated in the Basel III standards. Hence, the subject dealt in this paper represents a realistic outlook upon the situation of the financial system at the moment, in its struggle to forecast a potential systemic threat and the instruments needed to counteract it in order to diminish its negative effects. In the last part of the paper there is presented evidence from a few countries that started to implement the SRB and G-SII or O-SII buffers or are phased for implementation to the extent of 2019.

40|$|Using our updated {{model of}} the payment {{exchange}} system within the banking industry, we have introduced sudden local economic shocks and calculated their effect on {{the stability of the}} financial system. Our results suggest that the probability of a total banking failure, i. <b>e.,</b> the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> of the system, is insignificant unless the degree of the shock and the degree of integration between banks are very large. We find that the larger the shock, i. e., the greater the amount of loss amongst all banks, and the more isolated banks are within the payment system, the greater the likelihood of a localized or global banking system failure. However, given the current limits percentages of capitol banks can loan each other, only worldwide economic crises of cataclysmic significance would cause a collapse of the entire banking system. Hence we affirm the findings of our previous work which considered the effects of a bank failure generated by factors internal to the banking system (internal instead of internal shocks), which suggest there is minimal <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in an integrated, minimally regulated, banking system. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is {{an issue}} of great concern in modern {{financial}} markets as well as, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. It refers to the risk of collapse of an entire complex system, {{as a result of the}} actions taken by the individual component entities or agents that comprise the system. We investigate the topic of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> from the perspectives of measurement, structural sources, and risk factors. In particular, we propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures that accommodate a rich set of regulatory preferences.

Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> to each agent that correctly accounts for the externalities of the agent's individual decision-making on the entire system. Also, we provide a structural model for a financial network consisting of a set of firms holding common assets. In the model, endogenous asset prices are captured by the marketing clearing condition when the economy is in equilibrium. The key ingredients in the financial market that are captured in this model include the general portfolio choice flexibility of firms given posted asset prices and economic states, and the mark-to-market wealth of firms. The price sensitivity can be analyzed, where we characterize the key features of financial holding networks that minimize <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> as a function of overall leverage. Finally, we propose a framework to estimate risk measures based on risk factors. By introducing a form of factor-separable risk measures, the acceptance set of the original risk measure connects to the acceptance sets of the factor-separable risk measures. We demonstrate that the tight bounds for factor-separable coherent risk measures can be explicitly constructed...|$|R
40|$|When banks extend {{loans to}} each other, they {{generate}} a negative externality {{in the form}} of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> They create a network of interbank exposures by which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper, we show how a regulator can use information ab out the financial network to devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different impact on creating <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> they are taxed differently. We call this tax a <b>Systemic</b> <b>Risk</b> Tax (SRT). We show that this SRT induces a unique equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient, i. <b>e.</b> it minimizes <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> given a certain transaction volume. On the other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings can exist and are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively `rewire' the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume. Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e. g. a Tobin-like tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to have a limited effect on reducing <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> while it decreases transaction volume...|$|R
40|$|External or {{internal}} shocks {{may lead}} to the collapse of a system consisting of many agents. If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to fail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighboring agents. Several critical constellations determine whether this cascade remains finite or reaches the size of the system, i. <b>e.</b> leads to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> We investigate the critical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are characterized by an individual threshold θi determining their capacity to handle a load αθi with 1 − α being their safety margin. If agents fail, they redistribute their load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular network. For three different threshold distributions P (θ), we derive analytical results for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a measure of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> and the time when it stops. We focus on two different regimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of the order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal event where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent. We find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the network finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold distribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations {{may lead to}} full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the “big” shock is not the problem, as the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> only varies slightly for changes of 10 to 50 percent of the external shock. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> depends much more on ingredients such as the network topology, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which gives hints on how to reduce <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the emergence of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in a network model of interconnected bank balance sheets. Given a shock to asset values of one or several banks, <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> {{in the form of}} multiple bank defaults depends on the strength of balance sheets and asset market liquidity. The price of bank assets on the secondary market is endogenous in the model, thereby relating funding liquidity to expected solvency - an important stylized fact of banking crises. Based on the concept of a system value at risk, Shapley values are used to define the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> charge levied upon individual banks. Using a parallelized simulated annealing algorithm the properties of an optimal charge are derived. Among other things we find that there is not necessarily a correspondence between a bank's contribution to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> - which determines its risk charge - and the capital that is optimally injected into it to make the financial system more resilient to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> The analysis has policy implications for the design of optimal bank levies.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a quantitative analysis to verify {{the extent to which}} the sources of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> identified in the academic and regulatory literature actually contribute to it. This analysis shows that all institutions contribute to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> albeit to a different degree depending on various risk factors such as size, interconnection, un-substitutability, balance sheet and risk quality. From the analysis we conclude that using a single variable or a limited series of variables as a proxy for <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> generates considerable errors when identifying and measuring the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> of each institution. When designing <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation measures, all contributing factors should be taken into account. Likewise, classifying institutions as systemic/non-systemic would mean giving similar treatment to institutions that may bear very different degrees of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> while treating differently institutions that may have very similar charge of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> inside. Therefore, we advocate that some continuous approach to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> -in which all institutions are deemed systemic but to varying degrees- would be preferable. We acknowledge that this analysis may prove somehow limited in the way that it is not founded on a predefined conceptual approach, does not fully consider other very relevant qualitative factors 1 and accounts only for some of the relevant sources of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in the banking system 2.

40|$|<b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> {{refers to}} {{the risk that the}} {{financial}} system is susceptible to failures due to the characteristics of the system itself. The tremendous cost of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> requires the design and implementation of tools for the efficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current paper proposes a novel approach to measuring <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures from the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial regulator. The suggested <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures express <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in terms of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two ingredients: a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an acceptability criterion, i. e. a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a regulatory authority. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is measured by the set of allocations of additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual framework and the definition of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures, provide an algorithm for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case studies. Many <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal amount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after aggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out. In contrast, our approach emphasizes operational <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> measures that include both ex post bailout costs as well as ex ante capital requirements and may be used to prevent systemic crises.

40|$|The {{inability}} {{to see and}} quantify <b>systemic</b> financial <b>risk</b> comes at an immense social cost. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in the financial system arises {{to a large extent}} {{as a consequence of the}} interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange and securities.

In this work we quantify the daily contributions to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 - 2013.

We find that <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public.

We find that larger banks engage more in non-traditional banking activities. We also {{find that a}} bank’s size and a bank’s interconnectedness are main drivers of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> though we cannot confirm that banking activity is a main driver of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> As we match investment banks and commercial bank on bank size we find that investment banks still contribute more to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> during the Subprime crisis. Also, commercial banks engaging more in non-traditional banking activities increased their <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> contribution during the Subprime crisis though the difference to investment banks is not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the banking}} balance sheet as the source and {{transmitter}} of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is explored. We find that the key balance sheet channels of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> are; (i) bank capital structure choice, (ii) interconnectedness and interdependencies among firms, (iii) correlations of asset composition and returns and; (iv) behavioral determinants that affect the choices of bank managers. Furthermore, we argue {{that the source of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> lies with the endogenous risk of the banking balance sheet. We discuss the challenges in managing and measuring endogenous and <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> Considering the strong evidence that book values of leverage are key state variables, we suggest new methods to manage and measure <b>systemic</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for {{regulation}} in the marketplace is to reduce <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> However, regulation arbitrage - the transfer of commerce from a regulated sector to a less regulated or unregulated sector - brings markets a full circle and restores <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> For example, the banking sector was brought under regulations in order to reduce <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b> Since the banks themselves could not give credit where the risk (and therefore returns) were high, it was primarily the insurance sector which took over such deals. Thus the <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> migrated from one sector to another and proves that regulation of only one industry cannot be the sole protection against <b>systemic</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|R
40|$|In Europe, the {{financial}} stability mandate generally rests {{at the national}} level. But {{there is an important}} exception. Since the establishment of the Banking Union in 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) can impose stricter regulations than the national regulator. The precondition is that the ECB identifies <b>systemic</b> <b>risks</b> which are not adequately addressed by the macroprudential regulator at the national level. In this paper, we ask whether the drivers of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> differ when applying a national versus a European perspective. We use market data for 80 listed euro-area banks to measure each bank's contribution to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> (SRISK) at the national and the euro-area level. Our research delivers three main findings. First, on average, <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> increased during {{the financial}} crisis. The difference between <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> at the national and the euro-area level is not very large, but there is considerable heterogeneity across countries and banks. Second, an exploration of the drivers of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> shows that a bank's contribution to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is positively related to its size and profitability. It decreases in a bank's share of loans to total assets. Third, the qualitative determinants of <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> are similar at the national and euro-area level, whereas the quantitative importance of some determinants differs...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{show that}} <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> exerts a {{significant}} impact on the behavior of depositors, sometimes overshadowing their responses to standard bank fundamentals. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> can affect market discipline both regardless of and through bank fundamentals. First, worsening systemic conditions can directly threaten the value of deposits by way of dual agency problems. Second, to the extent that banks are exposed to <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> <b>systemic</b> shocks lead to a future deterioration of fundamentals not captured by their current values. Using data from the recent banking crises in Argentina and Uruguay, the authors show that market discipline is indeed quite robust once <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is factored in. As <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> increases, the informational content of past fundamentals declines. These episodes also show how few systemic shocks can trigger a run irrespective of ex-ante fundamentals. Overall, the evidence suggests that in emerging economies, the notion of market discipline needs to account for <b>systemic</b> <b>risk.</b> Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management&Restructuring,Banks&Banking Reform,Labor Policies,Banks&Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management&Restructuring,Insurance&Risk Mitigation,Environmental Economics&Policies...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{equilibrium}} multi-asset pricing model with micro- founded <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> and heterogeneous investors. <b>Systemic</b> <b>risk</b> arises due to excessive leverage and risk taking induced by free-riding externalities. Global risk-sensitive financial regulations are introduced {{with a view}} of tackling <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> with Value-at-Risk a key component. The model suggests that risk-sensitive regulation can lower <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in equilibrium, at the expense of poor risk-sharing, an increase in risk premia, higher and asymmetric asset volatility, lower liquidity, more comovement in prices, and the chance that markets may not clear...|$|R
40|$|Banking <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> is {{a complex}} {{nonlinear}} phenomenon and has {{shed light on the}} importance of safeguarding financial stability by recent financial crisis. According to the complex nonlinear characteristics of banking <b>systemic</b> <b>risk,</b> in this paper we apply support vector machine (SVM) to the prediction of banking <b>systemic</b> <b>risk</b> in an attempt to suggest a new model with better explanatory power and stability.
