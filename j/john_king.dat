5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} in Antioch, Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among his subjects. He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited <b>John,</b> <b>King</b> of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the lawful prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not provide him with military assistance.|$|E
5|$|Leo {{was dying}} when Raymond-Roupen came to Cilicia. Leo did not forgive his great-nephew and willed Cilicia to his five-year-old daughter, Isabella, in May 1219. Both Raymond-Roupen (the {{grandson}} of Leo's elder brother, Rupen) and <b>John,</b> <b>King</b> of Jerusalem (the husband of Leo's eldest daughter, Stephanie) {{refused to accept}} Leo's last will, claiming Cilicia for themselves.

5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir <b>John</b> <b>King,</b> convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the islands once ruled by Magnús and his fellow members of the Crovan dynasty before him, were {{incorporated}} into the Scottish realm. In 1293, the parliament of <b>John,</b> <b>King</b> of Scots (died 1314) established three new sheriffdoms within his kingdom. One of these three, the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have been taken over earlier, sometime after the dismantling of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E

However, in his second spell as manager from 1987, King took the team {{from the bottom of}} Division Four to the brink of English football's top league. Under his leadership, they won the League Trophy in 1990, and reached the play-offs for promotion to the newly formed Premier League in 1993, 1994, and 1995. In 1996, King was given the position of director of football and replaced by player-manager John Aldridge.|$|E

5|$|After King Richard {{went to the}} Holy Land on the Third Crusade, Nonant {{supported}} the efforts of Prince <b>John,</b> <b>King</b> Richard's brother, to seize power in England. Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham from William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard's absence. It was probably Nonant that {{was responsible for the}} meeting at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 that ended in the deposition of Longchamp from office. Nonant supported John's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity, and was tried with John after Richard's return to England in 1194. Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks. The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms, and retired to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|King Haco sailed {{afterwards}} {{south to}} Guðey before Kintyre where he anchored. There King John met him; {{he came in}} the ship with Bishop Thorgil. King Haco desired him to follow his banner as he should do. But King John excused himself. He said he had sworn an oath to the Scottish King, and held of him more lands than of the Norwegian Monarch; he therefore entreated King Haco to dispose of all those estates which he had conferred upon him. King Haco kept him with him some time, and endeavoured to incline his mind to fidelity. Many laid imputations to his charge. King Haco indeed had before received bad accounts of him from the Hebrides; for John Langlife-son came to the King, while he was sailing west from Shetland, and told him the news that <b>John</b> <b>King</b> of the Hebrides, breaking his faith, had turned to the Scottish Monarch. King Haco, however, would not believe this till he had found it so.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's second-in-command—although {{this was}} not {{clarified}} until the expedition reached the Antarctic—was Jameson Boyd Adams, a Royal Naval Reserve lieutenant who had turned down {{the chance of a}} regular commission to join Shackleton. He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old <b>John</b> <b>King</b> Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the P shipping line, was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord. Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} is regarded {{to have been}} the gravest threat to the Scottish kingdom since <b>John,</b> <b>King</b> of England's (d. 1216) northern campaigning and invasion in 1216. Although Óláfr's restoration on Mann was claimed as a success by the Norwegians, it was probably accepted gladly by the Scots as well; considering Óláfr's familial relationship with Alexander's protégé Ferchar and the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos. Óláfr consequently ruled the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully until his death, seven years later. At some point during his reign, he is known to have granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of the monastery of Holm Cultram. The chronicle states that he died on St Patrick's Isle on 21 May 1237 and was buried at St Mary's Abbey, Rushen. There is a possibility that a coffin-lid or grave-slab found at Rushen may be associated with Óláfr, or of two of his sons who are known to have been buried there (Rögnvaldr and Magnús).|$|E
