5|$|The anarchy in Constantinople {{had ceased}} {{after the murder}} of the pretender Constantine Doukas, however, and a {{government}} had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm. This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations, to the <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines. The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The <b>Joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cempaka Flowers).|$|E

5|$|When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, {{his estate}} and {{the titles of}} the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius's own grandson, Gemellus, who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still {{conjecture}} that he was murdered. Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect, Macro, smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to the <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman people, while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian. Seneca the Elder and Philo, who both wrote during Tiberius's reign, as well as Josephus record Tiberius as dying a natural death. Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius's will nullified with regard to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius's wishes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} in Myra the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smells like rose water, called manna (or myrrh), which is {{believed}} by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to do so, much to the <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken {{all over the world}} for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint's feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.|$|E
25|$|The French fleet, {{composed}} of 14 galleons, 13 pataches, 17 galleys and 3 fireships, was soon put on line {{and opened fire}} on the Spanish fleet. Sourdis' vice-admiral was ahead with 6 ships and 5 galleys, Sourdis followed him with 11 ships and 7 galleys, while 12 ships and 5 galleys closed the formation. Sourdis sailed towards the Point of Salou, attempting to bar the way to Maqueda. The Spaniards immediately responded to the fire with their galleons, causing serious damage to the French galleons, and forcing the French fleet to leave the harbor entrance. With the blockade broken, and the French fleet engaged in battle with the Spanish galleons, the Spanish convoy of 65 ships, escorted by some Spanish galleys, entered the port, to the great <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders. Having achieved the main objective, the Spanish galleys were reorganized and attacked the flank of the French fleet. At the same time, Maqueda fell upon the French vanguard supported by his galleons. In {{the middle of the}} action, the ship under admiral Orellana lost its mainsail and had to be relieved by the Testa de Oro. The French galleons Forte and Licorne were put out of action, but Sourdis did not lost a single ship. Having managed to hold off a superior fleet, he ordered the withdrawal on 25 August. But if he had saved his whole fleet, the Spaniards had obtained the naval control of the area. The siege of Tarragona was lifted, and the Spanish fleet was able to provision the towns of Roses, Perpignan and Collioure.|$|E
