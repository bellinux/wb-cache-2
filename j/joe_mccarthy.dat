5|$|Connie Mack {{holds the}} Major League Baseball {{record for most}} games won as a manager, with 3,731, and most managed with 7,755. Bruce Bochy has the most wins among active managers, with 1,618, and games managed, with 3,222, as {{of the end of}} the 2013 season. The all-time leaders in championships won in the World Series era (1903–present) are <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> and Casey Stengel, who each won seven championships with the New York Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Former {{manager for}} the Yankees, <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> came out of {{retirement}} after a feud with Yankee ownership to sign with the Red Sox as their manager in 1948. Both the Yankees and the Red Sox {{were involved in a}} tight pennant race with the Cleveland Indians until the final weekend. The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant. The situation forced the first-ever one-game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 8–3 at Fenway Park. The city of Boston missed out on a chance for its first all-Boston World Series, as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series, the last one the Indians have won to date.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{managers}} spent long tenures {{with the}} Yankees. <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> managed the Yankees from 1931 until {{midway through the}} 1946 season. During his tenure, the Yankees won eight American League titles and won the World Series seven times. He won 1,460 regular season games with the Yankees and lost 867, both {{more than any other}} Yankee manager. Casey Stengel managed the team from 1949 until 1960, winning 10 American League championships, 7 World Series titles, and 1,149 games, which ranks third among Yankee managers. After Stengel was discharged, Ralph Houk managed the Yankees from 1961 through 1963, winning American League titles each season, and winning the World Series twice. He served a second term as Yankee manager from 1966 through 1973.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season. He {{was again}} named an All-Star during the 1938 season. Yankees' manager <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy,</b> who managed the AL {{team in the}} All-Star Game, chose {{teammate}} Lefty Gomez as the starting pitcher. As McCarthy {{did not believe in}} pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did not appear in the game. He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league, behind only Grove. Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs. He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs. Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the New York Yankees Major League Baseball (MLB) team spans more than a century. Frank J. Farrell and William Stephen Devery bought the rights to an American League (AL) club in New York City after the 1902 season. The team, which {{became known as the}} Yankees in 1913, rarely contended for the AL {{championship}} before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth after the 1919 season. With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees won their first AL title in 1921, followed by their first World Series championship in 1923. Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part of the team's Murderers' Row lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-AL record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927 under Miller Huggins. They repeated as World Series winners in 1928, and their next title came under manager <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Yankees, Wensloff spent the 1943 season on the Yankees' major league roster. During spring training, Yankees manager <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> had heard impressive things about Wensloff, though he had not seen him pitch often. Wensloff made his major league debut for the Yankees on May 2, 1943 against the Washington Senators. In his debut, the second game of a doubleheader, he allowed four earned runs and seven hits in eight innings as the Yankees lost, 41. He won his first game in his next pitching appearance on May 7, 1943 against the Philadelphia Athletics, allowing no walks and six hits in a 62 victory. By the end of June, he had six complete games in his first six starts. However, he was not receiving the publicity other rookies were, such as pitcher Jesse Flores, and had four wins and four losses despite how well he had been pitching.|$|E

50|$|In late 1950, {{his name}} {{appeared}} on the Hollywood blacklist as a Communist sympathizer.

Some of the organization's most famous current members include Noam Chomsky, Tom Morello, mixed martial arts fighter Jeff Monson and anthropologist David Graeber.|$|E
25|$|Though Jackson {{opposed the}} excesses of <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy,</b> who had {{traveled}} to Washington State to campaign against him in 195, he also criticized Dwight Eisenhower for not spending enough on national defense. Jackson called for more inter-continental ballistic missiles in the national arsenal, and his support for nuclear weapons resulted in a primary challenge from the left in 1958, when he handily defeated Seattle peace activist Alice Franklin Bryant before winning re-election with 67 percent of the vote, which he topped the next four times he ran for re-election.|$|E

Someday. But not anytime soon, and certainly not before Yassin M. Aref, the former imam at an Albany mosque, and Mohammed M.

50|$|The 1943 World Series {{matched the}} {{defending}} champion St. Louis Cardinals against the New York Yankees, in a rematch of the 1942 Series. The Yankees won the Series in five games for their tenth championship in 21 seasons. It was Yankees manager <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy's</b> final Series win. This series {{was also the first}} to have an accompanying World Series highlight film (initially, the films were created as gifts to troops fighting in World War II, to give them a brief recap of baseball action back home), a tradition that still persists.|$|R

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Civil War, Wisconsin was a Republican state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, {{although}} ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition. Through {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived Progressive Party. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and Democrats. Republican Senator <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy</b> was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner; prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Congressman David Obey.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Bolshevik Revolution and the {{subsequent}} rise of the USSR, both major American political parties became strongly anti-Communist. Within the U.S., the far Left split and an American Communist Party emerged in the 1920s. Conservatives denounced Communist ideals as a subversion of American values and maintained relentless opposition to Communist principles until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Conservatives were especially sensitive to the perception of Communist elements trying to change national policies and values in the U.S. government, the media, and academia. Conservatives enthusiastically supported anti-Communist agencies such as the FBI, were chief proponents of the Congressional investigations of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly those led by Richard Nixon and <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy,</b> and were wary of ex-Communists who exposed the system, such as Whittaker Chambers.|$|E

50|$|McCarthy was one {{of three}} actors (with Dick Miller and Robert Picardo) often cast by {{director}} <b>Joe</b> Dante. <b>McCarthy's</b> most notable role in Dante's films was in 1987 as the prime antagonist, Victor Scrimshaw, in Innerspace.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} {{correspondent}} in Washington (1950-52), where his advocacy of Senator <b>Joe</b> <b>McCarthy's</b> pursuit of communist subversion in the United States government {{eventually led to}} a split with the more circumspect Times, and, in 1953, he joined The Daily Telegraph. Despite moving to a newspaper more suited to his politics, Worsthorne nevertheless left The Times with some regret, feeling that working for any other title in Fleet Street could only be anti-climactic, and that working conditions at The Telegraph were inferior to those at The Times, then based at Printing House Square. At this time he also contributed articles to the magazine Encounter (then covertly funded by the CIA).|$|R
