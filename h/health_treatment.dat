5|$|Alaska possessed no mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> {{facilities}} {{prior to}} the passage of the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

25|$|Attachment {{theory has}} led to a new {{understanding}} of child development. Children develop different patterns of attachment based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental <b>health,</b> <b>treatment</b> of children, and related fields.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Older {{adults are}} {{the fastest growing}} age group in Australia, necessitating an {{increase}} in appropriate mental health services in the coming years. While Internet-delivered mental <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> have been established as acceptable and efficacious among younger samples, little research has explored whether they would be similarly useful in older populations. Methods: The participants {{were part of the}} Australian Rural Mental Health study, which explores mental health and well-being in residents of non-metropolitan New South Wales. A postal survey was used to assess knowledge of and intentions to use Internet-delivered mental <b>health</b> <b>treatments.</b> Demographics, mental <b>health,</b> and frequency of Internet use were also measured. Results: The survey was completed by 950 adults aged 50 - 93. The sample was largely unfamiliar with Internet mental health services, with 75 % reporting that they had never heard of them and a further 20 % not knowing any details of what they involved. Intentions to use these services were also low, at 13. 5 %; however, this increased with level of familiarity. Respondents with higher psychological distress, higher education, and more frequent Internet use {{were significantly more likely to}} consider using Internet treatments. Conclusions: Among older adults, overall awareness of Internet-delivered mental <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> appears to be limited; however, higher familiarity contributes to higher intentions to use these treatments. Importantly, respondents with higher distress and greater computer literacy were more likely to consider mental <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> delivered via the Internet. Future research exploring strategies to increase the promotion of these services to older samples may further improve their perceptions and use...|$|R

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder is rarely {{the primary reason}} for people seeking mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment.</b> When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders, or at the insistence of relatives and friends. This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor insight and fail to recognize their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive self-image.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2000 {{study of}} the World Health Organization (WHO), {{publicly}} funded systems of industrial nations spend less on healthcare, both {{as a percentage of}} their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes. However, conservative commentator David Gratzer and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> and rated countries by comparison to their expected healthcare performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{farming system}} and {{sustainable}} management of soil pathogens aim at reducing {{the use of}} agricultural chemicals {{in order to improve}} ecosystem health. Despite the essential role of microbial communities in agro-ecosystems, we still have limited understanding of the complex response of microbial diversity and composition to organic and conventional farming systems and to alternative methods for controlling plant pathogens. In this study we assessed the microbial community structure, diversity and richness using 16 S rRNA gene next generation sequences and report that conventional and organic farming systems had major influence on soil microbial diversity and community composition while the effects of the soil <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> (sustainable alternatives for chemical control) in both farming systems were of smaller magnitude. Organically managed system increased taxonomic and phylogenetic richness, diversity and heterogeneity of the soil microbiota when compared with conventional farming system. The composition of microbial communities, but not the diversity nor heterogeneity, were altered by soil <b>health</b> <b>treatments.</b> Soil <b>health</b> <b>treatments</b> exhibited an overrepresentation of specific microbial taxa which are known to be involved in soil suppressiveness to pathogens (plant-parasitic nematodes and soil-borne fungi). Our results provide a comprehensive survey on the response of microbial communities to different agricultural systems and to soil treatments for controlling plant pathogens and give novel insights to improve the sustainability of agro-ecosystems by means of beneficial microorganisms...|$|R

25|$|Questions {{were raised}} about how Houser {{was able to}} obtain the gun used in the shooting. It was {{initially}} {{reported that he had}} been involuntarily committed for mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> in 2008, which would have legally prohibited him from purchasing firearms. However, it was later determined {{that he was able to}} purchase the gun because a judge never committed him and instead had him undergo a mental health evaluation. Once the evaluation was done, medical authorities either had to release him, convince him to commit himself voluntarily for treatment, or petition a court to force him to undergo treatment. They never petitioned the court, but it was unclear if Houser was released or voluntarily committed. His 2008 evaluation was never officially reported to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.|$|E
500|$|As a result, Cho escaped {{compliance}} with the court order for mandatory mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to [...] "recommend a specific course of treatment and programs" [...] for mental health patients and [...] "monitor the person's compliance."

500|$|During the investigation, {{the matter}} of Cho's court-ordered mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment</b> was also {{examined}} to determine its outcome.

The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment,</b> and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order. In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that {{the court did not}} notify his office that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental <b>health</b> <b>treatment.</b> Flynn added that, [...] "When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency...
