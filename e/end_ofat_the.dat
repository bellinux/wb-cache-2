In this research, pineapple waste is used as the carbon sources for the synthesis of bacterial cellulose. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of temperature, pH and concentration of pineapple waste in the production of bacterial cellulose by Acetobacter xylinum. Parameters investigated are varied from 40 % to 100 % for the concentration, while the temperature is between 28 °C to 32 °C and pH of 4. 5 to 8. 5. Besides, this study also aims to optimize the production of bacterial cellulose from pineapple waste by using response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD). The known value of the parameters is estimated earlier based on one factor at that time (<b>OFAT).</b> <b>The</b> results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> showed <b>the</b> optimum condition is at pH 5. 50, temperature 30 °C and concentration of pineapple waste is 80 %, where the amount of bacterial cellulose dry weight is 3. 3948 g.

This is especially true in the field of fuel cells, where so many material and operating parameters influence the performance. The dilemma faced by experimental researchers is twofold; on one hand reliable results are desired {{and on the other hand}} the experimental effort needs to be optimized to minimize the required resources. The one factor at a time (OFAT) method requires holding all input variables (factors) constant except one, whose effect on the output variable (response) is desired to be evaluated. As the number of factors increases, the required experimental effort increases exponentially, thus making it difficult to conduct an experimental campaign for a large number of factors due to limited time and resources. Also, an inherent assumption of <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> method, that <b>the</b> output variable is not sensitive to the level at which the constant factors are held, is not always true. When this is the case, the results from <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> method can be misleading. The design of experiments (DoE) method not only reduces the experimental effort required by planning the experiments in a systematic way, but also evaluates the main effects (effect of the factor considered in isolation) and factor interactions (effect of factor considered in regard to the level of another factor) for the considered factors. Factor interactions quantify the effect of the level at which the constant factors are held on other factors. Interactions could be very important and cannot be evaluated using <b>OFAT</b> method. <b>The</b> DoE, therefore, optimizes the experimental process itself by reducing experimental effort and improving the reliability of the results. It is the ideal method to use when a screening of large number of factors is desired. In this work, we quantify and compare the effects of various operating conditions such as anode and cathode gas stoichiometries, operating temperature and current density on single cell performance for four commercially available high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). DoE is utilized to evaluate the main effects and factor interactions of the above mentioned four factors on the cell voltage (response). Statistical models for the response of each MEA based on the statistically significant main effects and factor interactions are developed using linear regression analysis [1].

For the case of compact design space, I expand <b>the</b> treatment of <b>OFAT</b> by <b>the</b> removal of two restrictions imposed on the discrete design space. The first is that the selection of input level at each iteration depends only on observed best response and does not depend on other prior information. In most real cases, domain experts possess knowledge about the process being modeled that, ideally, should be treated as sample information in its own right-and not simply ignored. (cont.) Treating the design problem Bayesianly provides a logical scheme for incorporation of expert information. The second removed restriction is that the model is restricted to be linear with pair-wise interactions - implying that the model considers a relatively small design space. I extend the Bayesian analysis to the case of generalized normal linear regression model within the compact design space. With the concepts of c-optimum experimental design and Bayesian estimations, I propose an algorithm for the purpose of achieving optimum through a sequence of experiments. I prove that the proposed algorithm would generate a consistent Bayesian estimator in its limiting behavior. Moreover, I also derive the expected step-wise improvement achieved by this algorithm for the analysis of its intermediate behavior, a critical criterion for determining whether to continue the experiments. by Hungjen Wang.

The basic assumption is that organisms which have an intrinsic capability to replicate the most information at base- 4 ’s optimal α ratio should be the most successful by evolutionary considerations. Pelagibacter ubique and Prochlorococcus are believed to be such organisms. Here we show that if these marine bacteria are capable of replicating the most information, then their α ratios indeed lie inside base- 4 ’s optimal interval. Introduction. An organism has the same amount of genomic information when it is alive and dead. The difference is replication. The DNA code and its replication are two inseparable facet...|$|R
50|$|Hadamard {{matrices}} are square matrices {{consisting of}} only + and −. If a Hadamard matrix is normalized and fractionated, a design pattern is obtained. However, not all designs are equal, {{which means that}} some designs are better than others, and specific design criteria are used to determine which design is best. After obtaining a design pattern, experimenters know to which setting each factor should be set. Each row in the pattern indicates a run, and each column indicates a factor. For the partial design pattern shown left, the experimenter has identified seven factors that may {{have an effect on}} the response and hopes to gain insight as to which factors have an effect in eight runs. In the first run, factors 1, 4, 5, and 6 are set to high levels while factors 2, 3, and 7 are set to low levels. Low levels and high levels are settings typically defined by the subject matter expert. These values are extremes but not so extreme that the response is pushed into non-smooth regions. After each run, results are obtained; and by fluctuating multiple factors in single runs instead of using <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> method, interactions between variables may be estimated as well as the individual factor effects. If two factors interact, then the effect one factor has on the response is different depending on the settings of another factor.|$|R
40|$|Azotobacter vinelandii {{is a model}} {{free-living}} diazotroph, which converts {{atmospheric nitrogen}} into ammonia {{in the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen. During the last decades, extensive work has been carried out to study the genetic and metabolic properties of free living nitrogen fixing bacteria. However, there is still little information regarding biomass production of these types of microorganisms for fertilizer applications. The present work aims to develop an optimum medium for cell mass production of A. vinelandii. At first, several medium formulations, surveyed from previous published literature, were tested for their potency to support cell growth. The highest cell mass concentration obtained in shake flask cultures was only 3. 94 g. L- 1. This medium was optimized using both one factor at time (OFAT) and statistical approaches. Using OFAT design, glucose, yeast extract, phosphate salt and ammonium sulfate concentrations were optimized individually. The maximum cell mass obtained using <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> approach was 7. 71 g. L- 1. The Box-Behnken design on the other hand resulted in the production of a maximal cell mass corresponding to 8. 82 g. L- 1. Although the maximal cell growth resulted using statistical design medium optimization was higher, the medium optimized using the classical design showed a 35. 5 % higher cell yield on glucose and was thus concluded as the more economical choice for scale-up experiments...|$|R
30|$|The {{suitable}} production {{media was}} optimized using various culture conditions (pH, temperature and inoculum volume) and medium components (carbon sources and nitrogen sources) utilizing <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> method after {{working out a}} series of experiments. The fermentation conditions and medium components were substituted one by one by keeping other factors constant in the production medium. The antibacterial substance production by strain LAP 1 was examined by adjusting the pH (4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) of the production medium using 1  N HCl and 1  N NaOH. Similarly, the production of antagonistic substances with strain LAP 1 was optimized by varying their respective conditions such as incubation temperature (20 – 70  °C) and inoculum volume (0.5 – 2  %) at the optimized pH. Likewise, the various media components such as carbon sources (maltose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, and xylose individually at 1.0  % w/v) and nitrogen sources (ammonium acetate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and sodium nitrate individually at 0.5  % w/v) were substituted in the production medium in order to achieve maximum production of antibacterial substances. An appropriate control medium was also maintained. All of the flasks were aseptically inoculated with the isolate and kept in an orbital shaker (120  rpm) for 48  h. The CFNS was collected after centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10  min, followed by membrane (0.22  μm) filtration of the supernatant and neutralization. The CFNS was collected and the antibacterial activity (AU/ml) was examined against the most susceptible indicator bacteria as described above.|$|R
40|$|Simulated strain-gage balance {{calibration}} data {{is used to}} compare the accuracy of two balance calibration model building methods for different noise environments and calibration experiment designs. The first building method obtains a math model for the analysis of balance {{calibration data}} after applying a candidate math model search algorithm to the calibration data set. The second building method uses stepwise regression analysis in order to construct a model for the analysis. Four balance calibration data sets were simulated in order to compare the accuracy of the two math model building methods. The simulated data sets were prepared using the traditional One Factor At a Time (<b>OFAT)</b> technique and <b>the</b> Modern Design of Experiments (MDOE) approach. Random and systematic errors were introduced in the simulated calibration data sets in order to study their influence on the math model building methods. Residuals of the fitted calibration responses and other statistical metrics were compared in order to evaluate the calibration models developed with different combinations of noise environment, experiment design, and model building method. Overall, predicted math models and residuals of both math model building methods show very good agreement. Significant differences in model quality were attributable to noise environment, experiment design, and their interaction. Generally, the addition of systematic error significantly degraded the quality of calibration models developed from OFAT data by either method, but MDOE experiment designs were more robust with respect to the introduction of a systematic component of the unexplained variance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Microbial extracellularalkaline proteases {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} industrial enzymes with a wide range of applications in various industries. In the present study, the production of an alkaline protease by Bacillus pseudofirmus MSB 4 was evaluated using response surface methodology (RSM). Materials and methods: Four significant independent variables were selected, based on the results of one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach (xylose concentration, beef extract concentration, pH and temperature), for rotatable central composite design (RCCD) to analyze the response pattern and to establish a model. The design consisted of total 30 runs, at five levels for each factor, with four replications of the center points. In addition, the presence of extracellular alkaline protease genes was evaluated by using PCR. Results: Maximum protease production (185. 397 U/ml), 2. 2 times higher than that of OFAT method and 3. 7 times higher than the unoptimized conditions, was obtained by using 3 % w/v beef extract, at pH 9 and 37 ºC according to the results of RCCD. Furthermore, the genes sub I, II and apr with the expected size (319, 486 and 194 bp, respectively) corresponding to the extracellular alkaline serine protease and metalloprotease were detected in MSB 4 by using PCR. Discussion and conclusion: The experimental data well fitted the model (Adj R 2 : 0. 9982) and the established quadratic model has a great ability to predict responses for new observations (Pred R 2 : 0. 9967). The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>OFAT</b> and RSM strategies were a useful screening and optimization method for enhancing protease production of MSB 4, respectively...|$|R

To this end, AFFTC engineers have completed DOE orientation courses and a three-week course in basic statistics and DOE. The AFFTC then identified specific engineer technical experts {{as members of the}} AFFTC initial DOE cadre. Members of this initial cadre have implemented DOE as a test strategy to three USAF Test Pilot School (TPS) Test Management Projects (TMPs). Although these TMPs are still on-going, preliminary results show strong applicability to two of the three TMPs—Project HAVE NOT and Project START. The third TMP, Project LOST WINGMAN, is a classical DT&E flight test program with a gradual build-up approach in which the test team has chosen to use One Factor At a Time (<b>OFAT),</b> in which <b>the</b> number of factors and levels is kept to an absolute minimum, as the test strategy. Nonetheless, the Project LOST WINGMAN test team has created two DOE test matrices as secondary test objectives to acquire data on the applicability of DOE to these types of gradual build-up DT&E flight test programs. Since DOE as a test strategy continues to show promise, the AFFTC is continuing with training a second DOE cadre in the fall of 2005, and will use DOE for the next round of USAF TPS TMPs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{short-term}} studies (≤ 6 h) showed differ-ences {{in energy}} expenditure (EE) and macronutrient oxidation {{in response to}} overfeeding with different types of dietary carbohy-drate. This finding could have implications for obesity. Objective: We used 96 -h continuous whole-body calorimetry in 8 lean and 5 obese women to assess metabolic disposal (energy dissipation and glycogen or fat storage) of a controlled excess of dietary energy supplied as different carbohydrate sources or as fat. Design: Five dietary treatments were applied in random order: energy balance (control) and overfeeding by 50 % of energy requirements with fat (Ofat) or predominantly with glucose, fruc-tose, or sucrose (Ocho). Macronutrient oxidation rates were assessed from nonprotein gaseous exchanges. Net macronutrient balances were calculated as cumulative differences between intake and oxidation. Results: Increased EE in response to overfeeding dissipated 7. 9 % of the energy excess with a variation in EE of < 1. 7 % across over-feeding treatments (NS). EE during <b>the</b> <b>Ofat</b> treatment signifi-cantly exceeded that during the control treatment in the lean {{but not in the}} obese women. There {{were no significant differences between}} lean and obese women in macronutrient oxidation or balances, so data were pooled. Ocho induced glycogen storage on day 1 (100 g) but thereafter progressively stimulated carbohy-drate oxidation so that balance was reached on days 3 and 4. Fat oxidation was proportionately suppressed. Of the excess carbo-hydrate, 74 % was oxidized; there were no significant differences between the various Ocho treatments. Ofat stimulated fat oxidation by 18 % and suppressed carbohydrate oxidation. On average, 12 % of the excess energy was stored as glycogen and 88 % as fat; there was no significant difference between overfeeding treatments. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in fat balance during controlled overfeeding with fat, fructose, glucose, o...|$|R
40|$|Omega- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} PUFA) plays {{a vital role in}} a number of human health aspects substantially for the regulation of biological function,prevention and treatment of human diseases. Subsequently,humans cannot synthesize the omega- 3 PUFA,eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid(DHA),thus,intake comes predominantly from dietary. Therefore,the microalgae was discovered as an alternative source of fatty acids compared to fish oil since it offers better purification essential and has no risk of chemical contamination. Moreover,it also acts as a carbon dioxide fixer by photosynthesis process in reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are major factors give affect for microalgae growth which is carbon source,irradiance level, temperature,nutrient availability and salinity. This study is carried out to investigate carbon dioxide effect in the specific range of 2 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % at flow rate of 0. 2 L/min. Meanwhile,the irradiance levels are examined by using 31 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1, 82 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1, 125 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 and 156 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 by applying one factor at time (<b>OFAT)</b> in maximizing <b>the</b> production of omega- 3 fatty acids. The microalgae of Nannochloropsis sp. are cultured in f/ 2 medium with 300 ml working volume for 7 days of cultivation in an experimental system of photobioreactor. The omega- 3 fatty acid compositions of Nannochloropsis sp. under different culture conditions are analyzed by lipid extraction and gas chromatography analysis in order to acquire the maximum amount of yield production. The results showed that the highest eicosapentaenoic acid productivity by Nannochloropsis sp. had been obtained at 2 % of carbon dioxide aeration and 156 µmol photons m- 2 s- 1 which are 31. 3121 mg/ml and 35. 1339 mg/ml, respectively.

40|$|L-asparaginase {{is highly}} demanded in pharmaceutical, food and {{biosensor}} industry {{due to its}} remarkable properties in hydrolysing L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Owing to this significant property, L-asparaginase is widely produced through microbial fermentation. This research aims to produce L-asparaginase enzyme through microbial fermentation by the most potent isolate {{in the presence of}} chicken bone wastes as the substrate. Therefore, this research can be categorised into 3 parts where the first part was to perform several studies in determining the best enzyme producer and substrate while the second part was the effect of process parameters using One-Factor-at-a-Time (<b>OFAT)</b> method and <b>the</b> third part was the purification and characterisation study of L-asparaginase. Six millilitres (5 x 108 cells/ml) of Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 is the optimum inoculum size in 50 ml of pH 9 growth media at 40 °C for 2 days. In addition to that, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 was fully enhanced when it was engaged with 1. 0 % w/v of starch, 0. 2 % w/v of ammonium chloride and 1 % w/v of cooked chicken bone (CCB) as the carbon source, nitrogen source and substrate respectively. The effect of process parameters studied using OFAT method revealed that Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 is the most potent L-asparaginase producer in this research and it preferred nutrient broth as the growth media in producing L-asparaginase. Furthermore, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 L-asparaginase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. At the end of purification, 0. 42 % yield of L-asparaginase was obtained. In addition, the dialysed ammonium sulfate fraction of L-asparaginase was partially characterised which resulted to 40 °C, pH 8, Na+ and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) being the optimum incubation temperature, pH, metal ion and inhibitor respectively. In conclusion, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 is an excellent L-asparaginase producer when the fermentation is supplemented with high protein content of cooked chicken bone as substrate...|$|R
