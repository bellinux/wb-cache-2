40|$|The <b>ilities</b> are {{properties}} of engineering systems that often manifest and determine value after {{a system is}} put into initial use (e. g. resilience, interoperability, flexibility). Rather than being primary functional requirements, these properties concern wider system impacts with respect to time and stakeholders. Over the past decade there has been increasing attention to <b>ilities</b> in industry, government and academia. Our research suggests that investigating <b>ilities</b> in sets may be more meaningful than study of single <b>ilities</b> in isolation. Some <b>ilities</b> are closely related and do in fact form semantic sets. Here, we use two methods to investigate over twenty <b>ilities</b> {{in terms of their}} prevalence and their interrelationships. We look for trends related to <b>ilities</b> of interest in relation to system type and an understanding of their collective use. First, we conducted a prevalence analysis of 22 <b>ilities</b> using both the internet as well as the Compendex/Inspec database as a source. We found over 1, 275, 000 scientific articles published between 1884 and 2010 and over 1. 9 billion hits on the internet, exposing a clear prevalence-based ranking of <b>ilities.</b> Two questions we seek to address are: why and how are the <b>ilities</b> related to one another, and what can we do with this information. Initial steps to answer the first question include a 2 -tupel-correlation matrix analysis that exposes the strongest relationships amongst <b>ilities</b> based on concurrent usage. Moreover, we conducted some preliminary experiments that indicate that a hierarchy of <b>ilities</b> with a few major groupings may be most useful. The overall objective for this research is to develop a formalframework and prescriptive guidance for effectively incorporating sets of <b>ilities</b> intothe design of complex engineering systems...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>ilities</b> for systems {{engineering}} of subsystems and components is investigated. Prior work on <b>ilities</b> has emphasized or restricted their application to system level, non-functional properties. The premise {{of this work}} is that <b>ilities</b> can be applied with benefit, {{and in some cases}} out of necessity, to lower levels of systems as well. The veracity of this premise is established by providing examples that demonstrate how some <b>ilities</b> are passed and used as a non-functional property of electrical and structural subsystems in aircraft. It is further demonstrated that flowing <b>ilities</b> down to the subsystem level is not only a useful practice for systems engineers, it can also be an essential step to ensure that customer needs are actually met by the system under design or service. Systems engineers often lack the detailed knowledge of the subsystems or components required to translate <b>ilities</b> into functional requirements. Thus, the system <b>ilities</b> are passed down and translated from non-functional to functional requirements by subject matter experts. We first discuss the definition, characteristics and scope of <b>ilities.</b> Then, we formulate the application of <b>ilities</b> at a subsystem level. Next, we show aircraft engineering examples for <b>ilities</b> applications. The application process is formalized with diagrams, and ilities’ relation to system architecture engineering is discussed. The work concludes with a summary and suggestions for future work...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{incorporating}} “ilities” into systems seems a self-evidently good idea, as expressed by both written and spoken positions by technical and political leaders. Indeed, incorporating lifecycle properties such as flexibility, adaptability, and recently affordability and resilience, into systems is {{touted as the}} solution to modern day's ever increasing complexity, schedule and budget pressures, {{and the need for}} finding sustainable solutions. While expressing desires for <b>ilities</b> seems straightforward, tracing these desires to verifiable system instantiations remains ambiguous at best. This paper describes the semantic challenge underlying the concept of a coherent set of system properties, a sampling of various efforts to ascribe meaning to particular <b>ilities,</b> and proposes a prescriptive 20 category semantic basis for specifying a set of <b>ilities,</b> while avoiding the assertion of new definitions. The intention for this first pass prescriptive semantic basis is to begin a structured approach for exploring the existence of one or more semantic fields, which together form a coherent semantic framework for tracing desired <b>ilities</b> into verifiable system requirements and specifications. Preliminary results indicate that at least three semantic fields exist within the larger set of system lifecycle properties including change-type, architecture-type, and new ability-type <b>ilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Non-traditional design {{criteria}} such as flexibility, robustness, survivability and others (collectively {{referred to as}} the “ilities”) are increasingly recognized as critical system properties for the success of aerospace programs. While most decision makers would agree that the <b>ilities</b> are important system properties, they are neither well-defined nor easily evaluated in isolation. While some evaluation methodologies do exist (e. g., real options for flexibility), {{there is a need for}} a holistic framework for describing systems with these properties. This paper will explore the use of these “ilities ” properties as selection criteria in tradespace studies. A framework is described that can be used to incorporate <b>ilities</b> into conceptual design and tradespace studies in a systematic way. The framework is based on describing <b>ilities</b> in terms of changes in three dimensions: changes in the context, changes in the needs, and changes in the systems itself. The <b>ilities</b> are then interpreted as methods of navigating changes in this space. Quantitative analysis can be accomplished through Epoch/Era Analysis linking multiple discrete tradespace studies into a coherent timeline.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{complex systems}} and systems-of-systems are involved, the {{behavior}} of the whole entity is not only due to that of the individual systems, but also to the interactions and interdependencies between the systems. Classical systems engineering approach is not always suitable to manage such feature, and new tools and methods are required, capable to identify, analyze and quantify properties of the system-of-systems as a whole. This research addresses the need to deal with complex dependencies between systems, in both developmental and functional relationships. We propose a combination of two previously developed methods, to analyze functional and developmental dependencies between systems in a system-of-systems, and {{to assess the impact of}} such dependencies on metrics that characterize global prop erties of a system-of-systems over its life span known as <b>ilities.</b> The analysis can be used to drive decisions for system-of- systems design, architecture, and evolution, with respect to the identified metrics of interest. It also accounts for the presence of multiple stakeholders, and external factors that influence the operability and the development of a system-of-systems. The methods support the analysis of trade-offs between competing <b>ilities</b> and facilitates identification of better performing architectures. We show preliminary results of the application of the methods, and how the results can be interpreted to evaluate system-of-system <b>ilities</b> on synthetic problems.

40|$|Developing space systems {{often comes}} with high costs and long {{development}} times, resulting in significant investment. Space systems can take large amounts of resources to design, build, test, field, and operate, and can be required to operate {{for long periods of}} time in very harsh environments. These environments may be dynamic and possibly unanticipated during design and development. Given the large investment, space systems are expected to succeed in spite of encountering perturbations (disturbances or epoch shifts) that could impact their value delivery. The concept of value sustainment is proposed as the ability to maintain value delivery in the presence of such perturbations. Of the two types of perturbations, responses to epoch shifts (i. e. shift in context and/or needs) are investigated in this paper. The construct of Epoch Shift—Impact—Response—Outcome is proposed as a way to characterize and analyze historical system responses to changing operating contexts and needs. Four different historical cases, Iridium, Globalstar, Teledesic, and Galileo, and associated epoch shifts, are described, providing insights into how systems can respond to perturbations and what system characteristics aid in that process. The concept of <b>ilities</b> is briefly introduced, linking the system response to qualities that make a system successful. The epoch shift case studies, along with the corresponding displayed <b>ilities</b> in these systems, may provide a useful framework for future study. A broad survey of past systems characterized in this way may provide insights into the types of dynamic uncertainties that pose risks to such systems, as well as patterns of response (i. e. <b>ilities)</b> for such systems, in order to enhance the ability to intentionally design for value sustainment across dynamic operating environments in the future.

In this thesis, simulations have been performed of a re e ted sho k tunnel fa <b>ility,</b> operated at the University of Queensland, with the aim of providing a better understanding of the ow through these fa ilities. In parti ular, the analysis of the simulations fo uses on the premature ontamination of the test ow with driver gas and the generation of the high levels of noise experien ed in the test ow. The substantial omputational eort required by these al ulations has, in the past, meant that only parts of a fa <b>ility</b> have be modelled in any on...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaintaining system {{performance}} {{in the presence of}} uncertainties in design and operating environments is both challenging and increasingly essential as system lifetimes grow longer. In response to perturbations brought on by these uncertainties, such as disturbances, context shifts, and shifting stakeholder needs, systems can continue to deliver value by being either robust or changeable. These lifecycle properties, sometimes called “ilities”, have been proposed as means to achieve system value sustainment in spite of changes in contexts or needs. Intentionally designing for these lifecycle properties is an active area of research, and no consensus has formed regarding how these and other “ilities” might trade off. This paper describes ongoing research that investigates empirical examples of system changes in order to characterize these changes and to develop a categorization scheme for framing and clarifying design approaches for proactively creating <b>ilities</b> in a system. Example categories from the data for system changes include: the perturbation trigger for the change, the type of agent executing the system change, and the valid lifecycle phase for execution. In providing a structured means to identify system change characteristics, this paper informs future research by framing possible relationships between <b>ilities</b> and design choices that enable them...|$|R

We touch {{on some of the}} <b>ilities</b> and services that can be achieved with injector technology, and then focus on the uses of redirecting injectors, injec-tors that take requests directed at a particular server and generate requests directed at others. We close by noting that OIF is an Aspect-Oriented Programming system, and comparing OIF to related work. 1...|$|R
