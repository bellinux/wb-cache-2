25|$|The K200 {{series of}} {{vehicles}} transport mechanized infantry platoon {{is designed to}} keep personnel safe from small arms fire. The hull of the KIFV is of all-welded aluminium armour with an additional layer of spaced laminate steel armour bolted to it. This composite armour provides {{a higher level of}} protection for less weight. It can protect against 12.7mm on the side and 7.62mm on the rear, and against anti-personnel mines. The engine compartment is located at the front right of the vehicle and is separated from the remainder of the vehicle by a bulkhead. The engine compartment is fitted with a <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> that can be operated by the driver or from outside the vehicle. The air inlet, air outlet louvres and the exhaust pipe are located {{on the roof of the}} vehicle to allow amphibious operations.|$|E

These additional internal fuel tanks increased the fuel capacity from 250 l to 400 l. The new engine is the same as that used in one bank of that fitted to the T-54. With the new engine and additional fuel tanks, the range of the vehicle has been increased to 480km on the road, (590km with external fuel tanks) and 120km on the water. The 76.2mm D-56TS rifled tank gun can fire a new undercaliber AP projectile piercing up to 75mm at 60° from 2,000 meters. One such round has been added to a PT-76B typical ammunition load and so it can now carry 41 rounds. It was produced between 1959–1967.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The most {{commonly}} used indoor <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> are automatic sprinkling <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems.</b> However, such systems have disadvantages of difficult to maintenance and low in reliability. The design of a composite indoor fire distinguishing system has been proposed, which consists of a fixed fire early warning subsystem and a moveable <b>fire</b> detecting and <b>extinguishing</b> subsystem. The moveable <b>fire</b> detecting and <b>extinguishing</b> subsystem is established on an automated guided vehicle. The system is fully autonomic, robust, and easy to maintenance. In addition, it can promptly and precisely detect fire in its early stage, and extinguish it in time. Experiments have demonstrated {{that the system is}} applicable...|$|R

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred at}} 8:30 PM local time on 8 November 2008, during the submarine's first underwater test run. The submarine's <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> was triggered, sealing two forward compartments and filling them with freon R-114B2 gas (Dibromotetrafluoroethane, known as khladon in Russian). The gas, a hydrobromofluorocarbon refrigerant, {{is used in}} the Russian Navy's LOKh (lodochnaya obyemnaya khimischeskaya – [...] "submarine volumetric chemical") fire suppressant system. Each compartment of a Russian submarine contains a LOKh station from which freon can be delivered into that or adjacent compartments. Freon displaces oxygen, enabling it to extinguish fires rapidly in enclosed spaces. In high concentrations, it can cause , which progresses by stages into excitation, mental confusion, lethargy, and ultimately asphyxiation.|$|E
2500|$|This {{class of}} warship has seven {{independent}} Noske Kaeser air-conditioning plants allowing {{the ship to}} operate at a preset temperature and moisture level in ocean water ranging between 4°C and 30°C, and the air temperature between −4°C and 32°C. This also keeps the air pressure in the citadel five millibars higher than on the outside to prevent the drawing in of RBC (radioactive, biological, or chemical) contamination. These ships are also fitted with Sulzer und Weise seawater fire-fighting pumps and sprinkler systems. These are also ready to wet down the warship's ammunition magazines. In addition, a CO2 fire-extinguishing system protects the gas turbine and diesel engineering areas. The galleys are fitted with an ANSUL system and the flight deck and hangar with a Noske Kaeser Hy FEx foam <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>system.</b> Two Pall Rochem reverse-osmosis plants generate 15 cubic metres of fresh water each every 24 hours. This water is provided to the galleys, messes, and drinking water supplies, {{and it is also}} used for cooling the guns, the air-conditioners, and the engine room, in addition for [...] washing the helicopters. Water pumped to the guns, sensors, and air-conditioners is chilled by two Noske Kaeser refrigerators. An oil-fired hot-water boiler, made by the same company, provides the ship's heating, whereas the hot water for the galley and messes comes from a 600-litre, 45 kilowatt electric geyser.|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{duty and}} aeroderivative gas {{turbines}} for power generation and mechanical drive are installed inside an enclosure that is thermally and acoustically insulated and {{is equipped with}} <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems.</b> The enclosure is bolted on the gas turbine basement and is made of a steel frame that supports removable side panels, doors and roof sections. All the <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> <b>systems,</b> lubricating oil pipes and electrical systems are fitted inside the enclosure and release, together with the gas turbine, {{a large amount of}} heat that has to be dissipated to avoid overheating of the gas turbine itself and its auxiliaries. Overheating of the enclosures {{is one of the main}} reasons for gas turbine unplanned stops. For avoiding high internal temperatures, the enclosure is equipped with a cooling system consisting of pipes and fans, that extracts heat from the enclosure and limits the internal temperature increase. This paper presents a calculation model developed for the study of the enclosure cooling system. Results are compared with experimental data measured on an aeroderivative gas turbine used as mechanical drive for a natural gas compression station, and acceptable correspondence is achieved...|$|R
