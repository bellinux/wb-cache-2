5|$|The Lady's Realm was a British women's {{magazine}} published from 1896 until 1914, possibly until 1915. It primarily targeted upper-class readers {{as well as}} an aspirational middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, {{and columns}} by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, <b>Jack</b> <b>London,</b> and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well, particularly by its fashion editor Marian Pritchard.|$|E
5|$|While in Alaska, Wyatt rubbed elbows {{with future}} novelist Rex Beach, writer <b>Jack</b> <b>London,</b> playwright Wilson Mizner, and boxing {{promoter}} Tex Rickard, with whom Earp developed a long-lasting relationship. Rickard was {{a partner in}} the Northern Saloon and gambling house in Nome. Both the Dexter and the Northern Saloon competed for business with more than 60 other saloons in town serving an estimated 20,000 residents. Wyatt was arrested twice in Nome for minor offenses, including being drunk and disorderly, although he was not tried. Most members of law enforcement were corrupt or otherwise engaged.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky {{president}} Jesse Lasky {{was looking}} for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, <b>Jack</b> <b>London</b> and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love. Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as Heritage of the Desert.|$|E

5|$|Some stampeders were famous: John McGraw, {{the former}} {{governor}} of Washington joined, together with the prominent lawyer and sportsman A. Balliot. Frederick Burnham, a well-known American scout and explorer, arrived from Africa, only to be called back {{to take part in the}} Second Boer War. Among those who documented the rush were the Swedish-born photographer Eric Hegg, who took some of the iconic pictures of Chilkoot Pass, and reporter Tappan Adney, who afterwards wrote a first-hand history of the stampede. <b>Jack</b> <b>London,</b> later a famous American writer, left to seek for gold but made his money during the rush mostly by working for prospectors.|$|E
5|$|While Miller toured Europe {{and lived}} out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron's tomb, Coolbrith was saddled with {{custody of her}} daughter, and the care of members of her own family, so she set up house a in Oakland and {{accepted}} the position of city librarian. Her poetry suffered {{as a result of}} her long work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including <b>Jack</b> <b>London</b> and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland's library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} Los Angeles, Earp became an unpaid film {{consultant}} for several silent cowboy movies. In 1916, {{he went with}} his friend <b>Jack</b> <b>London,</b> whom he knew from Nome, to visit the set of former cowboy, sailor, and movie actor-turned-film director Raoul Walsh, who was shooting at the studio of Mutual Film conglomerate in Edendale, California. Walsh took the two men to dinner at Al Levy's Cafe on Main and Third Street. During the meal, the highest paid entertainer in the world, Charlie Chaplin, dropped by to greet Wyatt Earp. Chaplin was impressed by both men, but particularly the former Tombstone marshal.|$|E

5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer <b>Jack</b> <b>London</b> incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E
5|$|The East End {{has been}} the subject of {{parliamentary}} commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (1851) and Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London (third, expanded edition 1902-3, in 17 volumes). Arthur Morrison's novel A Child of the Jago (1896) is set in Bethnal Green, and recounts the story of a boy growing up in a slum surrounding Arnold Circus. Narrative accounts of experiences amongst the East End poor were also written by <b>Jack</b> <b>London</b> in The People of the Abyss (1903), by George Orwell in parts of his novel Down and Out in Paris and London, recounting his own experiences in the 1930s, as well as the Jewish writer Emanuel Litvinoff in his autobiographical novel Journey Through a Small Planet set in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was carried out in the 1950s by sociologists Michael Young and Peter Willmott, in Family and Kinship in East London.|$|E

He split the novels idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|R
