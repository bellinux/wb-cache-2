In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the <b>dynamometer.</b> Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was any hint of the power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached <b>dynamometer</b> car, achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow.

40|$|Piezoelectric <b>dynamometers</b> {{are out of}} use in high humidity. Experimental {{results showed}} that {{piezoelectric}} coefficients measured by the force-induced charges method initially fluctuated in a small range and then was unstable, and {{they could not be}} measured at high relative humidity (RH). The traditional shielding method-insulation paste was not quiet convenient, and it even added the weight of piezoelectric <b>dynamometers.</b> In this paper, a novel strategy that eliminates the influence of water adsorption with quartz surfaces on piezoelectric <b>dynamometers</b> was proposed. First, a water-quartz model was developed to analyze the origin of the RH effect. In the model, water vapor, which was adsorbed by the quartz sheet side surface, was considered. Second, equivalent sheet resistor of the side surface was researched, while the relationship of the three R’s (Roughness, RH, and Resistor) was respectively discussed based on the adsorption mechanism. Finally, fluorination technology was skillfully adapted to each surface of quartz sheets to shield the water vapor. The experiment verified the fluorination strategy and made piezoelectric <b>dynamometers</b> work in high humidity up to 90 %RH successfully. The results showed that the presented model above was reasonable. In addition, these observations also drew some useful insights to change the structure of piezoelectric <b>dynamometers</b> and improve the properties...|$|R

25|$|Tractive {{effort is}} a measure of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, tractive effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used <b>dynamometer</b> cars to measure tractive force at speed in actual road testing.|$|E

25|$|Both the 350 and 455 V8s {{were carried}} over from 1971 with {{horsepower}} ratings switched the new SAE net figures {{based on an}} engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a <b>dynamometer</b> rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.|$|E

500|$|Following {{trials that}} lasted over a year, No. 36001 {{was shown to}} have several flaws, {{including}} heavy coal and water consumption, mechanical unreliability, untenable working conditions for both fireman and driver, loss of steam through the cylinder rings and uneven weight distribution on the bogies. After renewing the cylinder assembly, it was tested around Brighton and Eastleigh using an LNER <b>Dynamometer</b> car, where good running was experienced at high costs in fuel and {{effort on the part}} of the fireman.

In later years some insight has emerged concerning No. 46236's outings. On the WR, having arrived at Plymouth from Paddington, the <b>dynamometer</b> crew were amazed that such a large locomotive had consumed so little coal; on the undulating tracks of the SR west of Salisbury, it was alleged that coal consumption was held down by running gently uphill then racing downhill without any attempt to follow the timetable passing times. Additionally, {{a photograph of the}} locomotive leaving Kings Cross, bound for Leeds on the ER, shows the locomotive with so little coal on board that none could be seen even from a somewhat elevated vantage point. [...] In other publications, driver Byford has been heavily criticised for his lacklustre driving [...] Certainly, Byford was so obsessed with minimising coal consumption that he never attempted to demonstrate any other facet of performance, but when coal consumption was being so accurately measured it was a reasonable assumption to draw that coal efficiency was the predominant requirement. Many years later, there was a degree of exoneration for driver Byford when the whole procedure was described as [...] "the most inconsequential and unrepresentative series of competitive trials ever to be held on the railways of Great Britain".|$|E
