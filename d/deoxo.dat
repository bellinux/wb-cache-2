40|$|Using Clostridium sporogenes cultures, {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} its gaseous metabolic end {{products on the}} activity of palladium <b>Deoxo</b> catalyst and on surface growth of some clinically significant anaerobes were demonstrated. A new product "Anotox" was shown to absorb these metabolites, which enabled uninhibited growth of anaerobes, and prolonged {{the life of the}} catalyst...|$|E
40|$|An {{optimised}} protocol {{has been}} developed for the coupling of dihydroartemisinin benzoate {{with a range of}} aromatic allylsilanes to provide a number of new C- 10 <b>deoxo</b> derivatives (11 a- 11 g) in yields ranging from 70 to 94 %. These compounds were up to ten times more potent than artemisinin in in vitro tests against the chloroquine resistant K 1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Ferrous mediated degradation of these analogues produces as the main product, a dicarbonyl formate 12, which is not seen when the same reaction is carried out with artemisinin or artemether. This finding may indicate that analogues in this class have a subtly different "antimalarial" mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|East Chicago {{is capable}} of {{processing}} air at a 6 - 7 E 6 SCFH rate. They can produce as much as 1. 2 E 6 SCFH 02 and 4. 5 SCFH N 2 (not coincidently) with a peak product efficiency of 85 - 86 % (product to total Intake). The general area demand has been as high as 10 E 6, as low as 4. 5 E 6, and is currently 8 E 6 SCFH totaI product. The plant is really four plants in one. At anyone time one or more plants can be down for maintenance and the others online and delivering to the pipe line that distributes their product to nearby steel plants, and to the liquid reservoirs (perlite insulated tanks) of 160, 160 and 200 E 6 SCF. At {{the time of our}} visit two plants were down and two were on line. The following describes the characteristics of one of the four plants. The cycle requires a base compressor (Brown Boveri, 22, 600 hp) that pumps to 90 - 100 psig, and a booster compressor (Clark, 14, 000 hp) that pumps to 300 psig. Filter houses (ca. 20 -ft x 20 -ft) feed the suctions and the discharge is scrubbed by dual, molecular sieve, beds 0 300 psi (6 - 8 hour cycle time). The beds are provided with dust blow down and down stream filter provisions. The scrubbers remove CO 2, the heavy HC, and water. The effectiveness of the scrubbers is measured by the record 6 years one of the plants ran w/o the need for thawing. The thaw operation takes about 4 days. It was interesting to learn that a plant can be brought on line in two and one half hours from a warm start. Major swings from N 2 rich to O 2 rich production take about an hour. Argon is a small constituent in air (0. 61) and thus not a major product. It comes off the main column at 761 Ar balance air components and is further purified in another column to 2 % N 2, 2 % O 2. The stream is then warmed, H 2 added, and run though a palladium <b>deoxo</b> to combine the O 2 to water. The water is removed in a dryer and the product reliquified to seperate the nitrogen. The final product is either drawn off and pumped to storage, or, in the case of case of the high purity product, pressure transfered directly from the final column to a properly cooled and purged truck backed right up to the column. The high purity product can be as low as 0. 3 ppm 02 by proper application of these procedures. Liquid Argon is the only product for which standing, loaded, trailers are provided vent recovery lines. The recovered gas is fed back to the crude Ar stream. The local O 2 monitoring equipment is a Teledyne 306 WA with ranges of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 PPM full scale. The wet cell unit is available from ENPRO for an estimated $ 3, 500. The N 2 in Ar is measured by a special in-house Linde instrument...|$|E
