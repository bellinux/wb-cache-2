40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{overview}} of the Brazilian regulatory framework for telecommunications, emphasizing the policies and models adopted for setting <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> prices. In particular, we show how the regulations on <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> services have evolved over time since the liberalization of the telecommunications sector (from July 1997 to December 2012), describe the two costing methodologies adopted, and formulate alternative approaches to address the regulatory challenges associ-ated with the pricing/costing mechanism used, the target balance between service-based and facilities-based competition, and the impact of real op-tions on the cost-based prices of regulated telecommunications services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the theoretical debate on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} asymmetric regulation. Recent positions on this debate can be broadly divided into two categories: (1) supporters of symmetric regulation; and (2) supporters of asymmetric regulation. The authors then analyse recent regulatory reform in France, Germany, the UK and US (with references to European Union policy) in terms of whether local policies on entry (licensing, cross-sector entry) and operation in a market (<b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access,</b> unbundling and number portability) are more or less asymmetric. The analysis has brought to light a number of macrotrends that may be useful in determining policy guidelines. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Developments towards Next Generation Networks (NGN) have {{a strong}} impact {{on the design of}} the markets for {{electronic}} communications in general, but specifically on intercarrier relations with respect to <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access.</b> Due to the fact that competition in the European telecommunications environment has brought about alternative providers and their business models it is an interesting area to investigate how these business models will develop in an NGN environment and which (additional) business models may emerge in the future. To that end, the current paper looks at the development of different business models in the PSTN world and likely developments in the NGN world. This leads to conclusions with respect to requirements of the future regulatory framework of next generation networks {{in order to maintain the}} achievements of competition in the telecommunications area...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} Europe {{is now on}} {{detailed}} implementation rather than policy determination. Even so, there are still relevant {{lessons to be learned}} from the US experience. The author believes that there are three main preconditions for a competitive market: non-discriminatory <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> cost-based <b>access</b> charges; an open and public regulatory process; and clear definition of regulatory authority. This Comment discusses each of these items and their relevance for Europe. ...|$|R
30|$|Another major {{application}} area of OW is {{in outdoor}} systems. From a commercial perspective, outdoor OW complements optical fibers in LAN <b>interconnections</b> <b>and</b> broadband <b>access</b> networks, providing a high-bandwidth and low-cost alternative [149]. The installation of an outdoor OW system alleviates {{the most significant}} expenditure of fiber deployment: the digging up and repairing of roads. In addition, current commercially available systems operate at 10 Gb/s Ethernet speeds, which are comparable to the speeds attained per channel in commercial optical fiber networks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} theories of regulation. It discusses {{the public and}} private interest theories of regulation, as the criticisms that have been leveled at them. The extent to which these theories are also able to account for privatization and deregulation is evaluated and policies involving re-regulation are discussed. The paper thus reviews rate of return regulation, price-cap regulation, yardstick regulation, <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> regulation, and franchising or bidding processes. The primary aim of those instruments is to improve the operating efficiency of the regulated firms. Huge investments will be needed in the regulated network sectors. The question is brought up if regulatory instruments and institutions primarily designed to improve operating efficiency are equally well-placed to promote the necessary investments and to balance the resulting conflicting interests between for example consumers and investors.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the infrastructure in digital television suffered from the flaws associated {{with the implementation of}} the 1995 Advanced Television Standards (ATS) Directive. 1 This paper is designed to assess {{the extent to which the}} 2003 Communications Act, implementing the 2002 Communication Directives, remedies these flaws, in the view of providing a better response to the bottleneck challenge. Particular emphasis will be given to the issues of <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> to gateways, 2 focusing on Conditional Access Systems, Electronic Program Guides and Application Programme Interfaces. The study is designed to demonstrate that, while responding to the technical aspects of bottlenecks regulation, the Act fails to adequately address the public policy implications of the bottlenecks/gateways challenge. This is manifested by the perception of the public as mere economic actors and the failure of prioritising the interests of consumers over commercial interests. The study emphasises the need for regulation based on clear objectives, designed t...|$|E
40|$|The {{market for}} {{telecommunications}} services {{needs to be}} segmented into user classes having similar transmission requirements and hence similar network architectures. Use of the following transmission architecture was considered: satellite switched TDMA; TDMA up, TDM down; scanning (hopping) beam TDMA; FDMA up, TDM down; satellite switched MF/TDMA; and switching Hub earth stations with double hop transmission. A candidate network architecture will be selected that: comprises multiple access subnetworks optimized for each user; interconnects the subnetworks {{by means of a}} baseband processor; and optimizes the marriage of <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> techniques. An overall network control architecture will be provided that will serve the needs of the baseband and satellite switched RF interconnected subnetworks. The results of the studies shall be used to identify elements of network architecture and control that require the greatest degree of technology development to realize an operational system. This will be specified in terms of: requirements of the enabling technology; difference from the current available technology; and estimate of the development requirements needed to achieve an operational system. The results obtained for each of these tasks are presented...|$|E

40|$|In the Internet {{information}} packets are {{routed through}} many vertically related hops. However these network hierarchies are not fixed. Two providers can be simultaneously vertically related in a routing process as supplier and retailer, while horizontally competing in another. We study pricing <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> decisions when ISPs become interconnected into a wider network. We find that <b>interconnection</b> lowers retail <b>and</b> <b>access</b> prices when the downstream industry is poorly differentiated. The profitability of interconnection {{also depends on}} the differentiation of the retail sector.

40|$|Citizens develop Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) in {{many areas}} as an {{alternative}} or their only way for local <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet. This access is often achieved {{through the use of}} several shared web proxy gateways. These network infrastructures consist of heterogeneous technologies and combine diverse routing protocols. Network-aware state-of-art proxy selection schemes for WMNs do not work in this heterogeneous environment. We developed a client-side gateway selection mechanism that optimizes the client-gateway selection, agnostic to underlying infrastructure and protocols, requiring no modification of proxies nor the underlying network. The choice is sensitive to network congestion and proxy load, without requiring a minimum number of participating nodes. Extended Vivaldi network coordinates are used to estimate client-proxy network performance. The load of each proxy is estimated passively by collecting the Time-to-First-Byte of HTTP requests, and shared across clients. Our proposal was evaluated experimentally with clients and proxies deployed in guifi. net, the largest community wireless network in the world. Our selection mechanism avoids proxies with heavy load and slow internal network paths, with overhead linear to the number of clients and proxies.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a high-throughput and scalable motion estimation processor architecture for multimedia system-onchip applications. The number of processing elements (PEs) is scalable {{according to the}} variable algorithm parameters and the performance required for different applications. Using the PE rings efficiently and an intelligent memory -interleaving organization, {{the efficiency of the}} architecture can be increased. Moreover, using efficient on-chip memories and a data management technique can effectively decrease the power consumption and memory bandwidth. Techniques for reducing the number of <b>interconnections</b> <b>and</b> external memory <b>accesses</b> are also presented. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scalable PE-ringed architecture is a flexible and high-performance processor core in multimedia system-on-chip applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Essay {{is to focus on}} the role of market power where <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> network <b>access</b> {{problems}} are involved. The Essay is organized by parts. Part I sketches the European Union history with respect to open network provision (“ONP”) policy. In Part II, the market-share concept of market power applied within Council Directive 97 / 33, European Community on Interconnection in Telecommunications of June 30, 1997 (“Interconnection Directive”) is criticized as an important source for an oversized regulatory basis. Instead, the criteria for an economically justified disaggregated regulatory framework for the ONP concept is pointed out in order to localize the proper regulatory basis. It is shown that the regulatory basis should be restricted to local cable-based networks (“monopolistic bottleneck areas”). Part III explains the role of efficient private bargaining of interconnection/access conditions, as long as monopolistic bottlenecks are absent. Next, Part IV analyzes regulation of interconnection to monopolistic bottlenecks, particularly, the role of the “essential facility” doctrine. Finally, Part V discusses costing and pricing issues of interconnection services within the ONP concept...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> {{globalization}} of <b>access</b> to information, scientific expertise and new technologies across the world, development of society is now progressing at a skyrocketing pace. Production in businesses is reaching maximum possible levels. This paper focuses on systemic evaluation of the interrelations among production processes of agricultural businesses running biogas plants. It represents a comprehensive proposal of a model instrument for comparison of production options in relation to available input materials in agricultural businesses. Interconnection of the economic, environmental and social factors is of growing significance for strategic progress along the lines of sustainable development of society. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose and to describe the practical application of a multi-criterion model as an instrument of decision-making processes with a view to establishing a procedure for comparison of available input materials for biogas plants from the viewpoint of maintaining the stability of systemic interrelations in the agricultural sector in the context of sustainable development...|$|R

30|$|Some other {{examples}} of research testbeds related to heterogeneous wireless networks include the testbed developed during the Mobility and Differentiated Services in a Future IP Network (Moby Dick) IST project, where an isolated testbed integrating access networks based on IEEE 802.11 b and UMTS technologies was implemented. Unfortunately, a complete vision of a 3 G operator was not given [24]. Afterwards, the DAIDALOS (Designing Advanced network Interfaces for the Delivery and Administration of Location independent, Optimised personal Services) and DAIDALOS II IST projects [25] continued the work started in Moby Dick and developed an open architecture based on a common network protocol (IPv 6), mainly to study mobility issues in a B 3 G heterogeneous network. Berlin's Beyond- 3 G Testbed and Serviceware Framework for Advanced Mobile Solutions (BIB 3 R) solved the mobile operator's network <b>interconnection</b> <b>and</b> supported additional <b>access</b> technologies like pre-WiMAX and Flash-OFDM [26]. Another relevant heterogeneous wireless testbed was implemented in the WHYNET project [27]. This project developed a wireless hybrid network testbed to assess cross-layer interactions in heterogeneous wireless systems based on sensor and mesh networks.|$|R
