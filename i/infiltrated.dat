We instituted the use of a checklist for compliance with guidelines, and as a mechanism of surveillance. The baseline incidence rate of IV <b>infiltrates,</b> determined by the voluntary reporting system, was 5 per 1000 line days. Following initiation of the guidelines and checklist, the IV <b>infiltrate</b> rate increased to 9 per 1000 line days. In most months, the detection of IV <b>infiltrates</b> was improved by use of the checklist. During the post-intervention period the rate of Stage 4 <b>infiltrates,</b> as measured by usage of nitroglycerin ointment, was significantly reduced. In conclusion, the detection of IV <b>infiltrates</b> was improved following our quality improvement interventions.

40|$|Myocardial {{mononuclear}} cell <b>infiltrate</b> is a spontaneous cardiac finding commonly identified in laboratory cynomolgus monkeys. The <b>infiltrates</b> are predominantly composed of macrophages with lesser lymphocytes {{and are not}} typically associated with histologically detectable cardiomyocyte degen-eration.

In the primary graft dysfunction grading system, {{the presence or}} absence of a radiographic abnormality is crucial in determining the incidence and severity of primary graft dysfunction. However, no consideration is given as to whether unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> have the same impact and relevance as bilateral <b>infiltrates.</b> This study aims to describe the incidence, features, and outcomes of posttransplant unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> and their effect on the novel primary graft dysfunction grading system. MethodsDepending on posttransplant radiographic appearance, 144 patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation were divided into 3 groups: no <b>infiltrates</b> (clear), unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> (unilateral), or bilateral <b>infiltrates</b> (bilateral). ResultsRadiographic abnormalities were seen in 43 % of donors and 61 % of posttransplant recipients (sensitivity = 76 %, specificity = 50 %). The percentage of recipients in the unilateral, clear, and bilateral groups was 26 %, 39 %, and 35 %, respectively. Lower posttransplant oxygenation (P <. 05), longer intubation hours, and more intensive care unit days (P <. 0001) were seen in the bilateral compared with the unilateral and the clear groups. A significant difference in the prevalence of primary graft dysfunction (P <. 0001) was seen, depending on whether unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> were included or excluded from the primary graft dysfunction grading. ConclusionsThe incidence of unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> is relatively high after bilateral lung transplantation. The early posttransplant outcome of the unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> is similar to that in the group having a clear chest x-ray film and significantly better than that in those with bilateral <b>infiltrates.</b> In bilateral lung transplantation, only bilateral <b>infiltrates</b> should be used as part of the definition of primary graft dysfunction...|$|R

The infiltration of lymphocytes and immature CD 1 a+ dendritic cells (DC) was characterized in papillary, poorly differentiated (PDC), and undifferentiated (UC) carcinomas to evaluate their association with immunological <b>infiltrates.</b> Design: A series of 527 consecutive cases of thyroid carcinoma treated by total thyroidectomy were investigated by histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The inflammatory <b>infiltrate</b> was quantified and typed in intratumoral and peritumoral tissues {{as well as in the}} controlateral lobe. Main outcome: The intratumoral <b>infiltrate</b> was strongly reduced or absent in PDC and UC. Intense <b>infiltrates</b> were detected in the PTC tall cell variant. In all histotypes, the extent of the intratumoral and peritumoral <b>infiltrates</b> was comparable. Immature DC were detected in PTCs and markedly reduced in PDC and UC.

Conclusions: Though a relationship between the extent of lymphocyte/DC <b>infiltrates</b> and the prognosis of PTCs could not be demonstrated, tumors with poor prognosis (PDCs, UCs) were characterized by markedly reduced lymphocyte/DC <b>infiltrates.</b> The study appears to confirm the protective role of DC and <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes against thyroid tumors...|$|R

Second, advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to define the genetic alterations present in small lesions.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} review the clinical characteristics of peripheral corneal <b>infiltrates</b> in contact lens wearers. METHODS: The charts of all contact lens patients with peripheral corneal <b>infiltrates</b> 1. 5 mm or less in size who presented to the office from 1987 to 1994 were reviewed. RESULTS: The {{epidemiological and clinical characteristics}} of peripheral corneal <b>infiltrates</b> associated with contact lens wear were reviewed in 52 patients (64 <b>infiltrates).</b> Forty-four patients presented with a single <b>infiltrate,</b> while the remaining 8 patients had multiple <b>infiltrates.</b> While there was no predilection for a specific quadrant of the cornea, when a subgroup of patients who wore extended wear lenses was analyzed, 19 of the 40 <b>infiltrates</b> were located in the superior quadrant. Forty percent of the patients were wearing disposable extended wear contact lenses, 21 % were wearing conventional extended wear lenses, 33 % were wearing conventional or frequent replacement/disposable daily wear contact lenses and 6 % were wearing rigid gas permeable lenses. The majority of patients had minimal conjunctival inflammation, an anterior stromal cellular reaction and minimal anterior chamber activity. A subgroup of 16 patients had corneal cultures of their <b>infiltrates.</b> In this group, 8 of the 16 had positive cultures. All patients had a resolution of the <b>infiltrates</b> without complications and the majority were refitted to daily wear soft or rigid contact lenses. CONCLUSION: Peripheral corneal <b>infiltrates</b> in contact lens wearers appears to be more common in patients wearing extended wear soft contact lenses.

The organisms that have been associated with peripheral <b>infiltrates</b> appear to be less "pathogenic" than those that have been reported to be associated with central corneal ulcer.
