These were not the <b>first</b> <b>Axis</b> naval attacks on Australia; during 1940 and 1941 five German surface raiders operated in Australian waters at various times. The German attacks were not successful in disrupting Australian merchant shipping, though Sydney was sunk with the loss her entire crew of 645men in November 1941 in a battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia.|$|E

This failure was significant; Erwin Rommel's front line positions at Sollum were {{at the end of}} an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and was threatened by the Tobruk garrison. Besieging Tobruk also required a substantial commitment of troops and prevented Rommel from making further advances into Egypt. By maintaining possession of Tobruk, the Allies regained the initiative.|$|E

The 96 DBAP of 3 BAK put 70 DB-3s into the air but lost 22 with many others returning damaged. The German fighter pilots had it very easy under these circumstances; unescorted bombers in a target-rich environment. JG 53 claimed 74 air victories for two losses. III./JG 53 claimed 36 air victories alone and 28 on the ground. JG 51 was credited with 12 fighters and 57 bombers. JG 54 accounted for 45 air victories and 35 {{on the ground for}} one Bf 109 damaged. The Bf 110s of SKG 210 accounted for 334 Soviet aircraft against 14 airfields.

40|$|We propose an {{automatic}} mesh decomposition technique based on {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) and Boolean operations. First, we calculate the normalized protrusion degree of each dual vertex on a smoothed 3 -D mesh. The protrusion degree of a vertex and the vertex’s 3 -D coordinates form a 4 -D feature vector, which we use to represent the polygon mesh. Then, we apply PCA to the set of 4 -D feature vectors. The projected data along the <b>first</b> principal <b>axis</b> reveals the salient structures of the 3 -D object. Therefore, by using the <b>first</b> component <b>axis</b> as the search basis, we can identify all the salient parts of an arbitrary 3 -D object...|$|R

The <b>first</b> <b>Axis</b> ships in Australian waters were the unarmed Italian ocean liners Remo and Romolo, which were in Australian waters when Fascist Italy entered the war on 11 June 1940, Eastern Australian Time. While Remo was docked at Fremantle and was easily captured, Romolo proved harder to catch, as she had left Brisbane on 5 June bound for Italy. Following an air and sea search, Romolo was intercepted by [...] near Nauru on 12 June and was scuttled by her captain to avoid capture.|$|E

Following this, Orion headed east and operated off New Caledonia before proceeding south into the Tasman Sea, sinking the merchant ship Notou south-west of Noumea on 16 August and the British merchant ship Turakina in the Tasman Sea four days later. Orion sailed south-west after sinking Turakina, passing south of Tasmania, and operated without success in the Great Australian Bight in early September. While Orion laid four dummy mines off Albany, Western Australia on 2 September, she departed to the south-west after being spotted by an Australian aircraft the next day. After unsuccessfully patrolling in the Southern Ocean, Orion sailed for the Marshall Islands to refuel, arriving there on 10 October.|$|E

The SOE, charged with fostering resistance movements, initially sent Captain D. T. Hudson as part of Operation Bullseye, to contact all resistance groups in September 1941. Hudson's reports on the meetings between Mihailović and Tito (and their staffs) were not encouraging, and he sent warnings that the communist Partisans suspected that Mihailović was collaborating {{with the government of}} Milan Nedić in Serbia. Contacts with both groups were severed by the <b>first</b> <b>Axis</b> winter offensive, but decrypts of German signals showed that the Chetniks were collaborating with the Italians.
