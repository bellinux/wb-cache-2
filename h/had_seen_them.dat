5|$|The 2/10th {{remained}} in Syria until January 1942 when, after having endured a freezing cold winter that included snow, it was transported back to Palestine {{in preparation for}} a return to Australia. Following Japan's entry into the war the previous December, and in light of Allied reverses in the Pacific, the Australian government had requested the return of some of its forces in order to bolster the defence of Australia due to concerns about a possible invasion. The 2/10th subsequently embarked on the Dutch passenger ship, Nieuw Amsterdam, bound for Australia in early February 1942. Stopping over in Bombay, the battalion was transferred to the transport Nevassa on which they continued the journey to Adelaide where they arrived in late March, after which a period of reorganisation and training followed around Kilcoy in Queensland, before the battalion was committed to its next campaign: New Guinea. Following Japanese landings on the north coast of New Guinea in July, Australian forces in the area had been fighting a desperate holding action, which <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> being pushed inexorably towards Port Moresby. By early August 1942, the situation for the Australians was critical.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
25|$|Tribunals {{had long}} been criticised. Lord Scarman <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> as {{a danger to the}} {{prestige}} of the judiciary and the authority of the ordinary law. In 1988 there were calls for an Administrative Review Council to provide independent scrutiny on the Australian model but such ideas were rejected.|$|E

25|$|Hoddle {{arrived at}} a troubled club with The Robins badly {{affected}} by a financial scandal which <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> stripped of promotion to the First Division {{at the end of}} the 1989–90 season, a controversy which had negatively impacted the team's league form as they had been forced to sell several key players including midfielder Alan McLoughlin.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{fortunes}} that <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> {{be successful}} so rarely the decade previous {{did not change}} in the 1940s. After the commitments of the Second World War, St Helens still {{found it hard to}} compete, and the trend of finishing as a mid—table side was once more apparent. The first two years of the 1950s, {{the last two years of}} Peter Lyons' reign, also ended trophyless.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1975, after {{appearing}} {{at the fourth}} Sunbury Pop Festival, The Dingoes {{received a phone call}} from expatriate Australian roadie Billy McCartney, who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> when visiting from the United States, where he had established himself as a tour manager for Elvis Presley and Rod Stewart. Returning to the US, McCartney recommended the band to Peter Rudge, who was then tour manager for The Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd, and, after ten months negotiations, Rudge agreed to manage The Dingoes in the US.|$|E

25|$|In July 1949, {{the city}} council {{approved}} a plan by the Birmingham COPEC Housing Improvement Society Ltd. to construct twenty flats for single women in Cob Lane. The council had been against flats initially as they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> as being unnecessary for their cost. However, as Birmingham's population expanded {{and the demand for}} housing increased, the idea of building flats and maisonettes across the city became more popular. Eventually, {{the city council}} acknowledged that there was a need for flats and started a programme to provide such properties for Birmingham's citizens.|$|E
25|$|The series between South Africa and England was {{a highly}} {{anticipated}} one. England had recently played for {{the best part of}} six months against the same opposition (New Zealand) winning the two test series 4–1 on aggregate. They were aware that South Africa would prove to be far superior opposition in the test arena. South Africa arrived in England off the back of a successful winter which <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> win series in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and draw one in India. They had also beaten New Zealand and West Indies on their home soil comfortably.|$|E
25|$|The novel tells {{myths of}} Autolycus, {{the son of}} Hermes and Chione, and Sisyphus. Autolycus steals the cattle of his {{neighbor}} Sisyphus; Sisyphus gains revenge by raping Autolycus' daughter Anticleia. Autolycus sends Anticleia to Ithaca to marry Laertes, who raises Odysseus, the son of Sisyphus and Anticleia, as his own. Sisyphus spies Zeus ravishing {{the daughter of the}} river god Asopus and tells Asopus where he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> in return for a gift of an eternal spring. He tricks death by trapping Hades in his own manacles. Hades is freed by Ares, but Sisyphus escapes death a second time by deceiving Persephone. At last Hermes takes Sisyphus to Tartarus, to be condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity.|$|E

25|$|Having {{qualified}} for the tournament through a last-gasp goal against France, Bulgaria surprised many people, as the nation had never even won a game at the World Cup finals prior to this tournament. Despite losing its opening game 3–0 to Nigeria, Bulgaria came back in style with a 4–0 win over Greece (who had suffered exactly the same fate five days earlier against Argentina), and a win against Argentina <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> advance. Argentina had actually been winning the group going into injury time, while Bulgaria played the last 25 minutes with 10 men; however, a 91st-minute header from Nasko Sirakov meant that Argentina dropped two places and finished third. Nigeria won the group on goal difference. Bulgaria's victory over Argentina earned them second place.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them,</b> they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
25|$|Duly {{declared}} fit, {{he appeared}} {{for his second}} examination before the magistrate. His solicitor, William Clegg, tried to prove that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms with Peace than {{she was ready to}} admit, and that Dyson had been the aggressor in a struggle in which Peace had reacted in self-defence. A number of pencilled notes had been found near the scene, which appeared to have been written by Mrs. Dyson, indicating a close relationship with Peace, though she denied having written them. (At the Coroner's inquest after the murder, she said her husband <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> and declared them to be forgeries, possibly by Peace himself.) After the hearing, Peace was committed to take his trial at the Leeds Assizes, to begin on 4 February 1879.|$|E

25|$|On 8 July 2007, Sligo claimed {{their first}} Connacht title since 1975 with a one-point victory over Galway. The {{following}} year they were trashed by Mayo {{and ended up}} in the Tommy Murphy Cup following on from a league campaign that <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> relegated to Division 4. Star player Eamonn O'Hara said he was embarrassed by the team's rapid decline back into mediocrity. On 27 June 2010, Sligo hosted Galway in a game which Sligo led 1–8 to 0–2 at halftime but were shocked by an undeserved draw ending 1–10 each. The replay saw Sligo defeat the Tribesmen on the scoreline 1–14 to 0–16 to advance to the Connacht Senior Football Final. Once there, after all their hard work and continued misfortune, Roscommon defeated them by 0–14 to 0–13.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|Scott Styris conceded 56 {{runs with}} the ball for Middlesex Crusaders in this National League game, but his four wickets near the end cut short Glamorgan's chase to bring Middlesex to victory. The Crusaders had been {{inserted}} by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, against a Dragons side whose National League season had seen their best performances, as both Championship, Twenty20 and C <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> finish below ninth. After Ed Smith departed for 6, fifties from Paul Weekes and Owais Shah sent Middlesex to 133 for 1. Dean Cosker took two quick wickets, but 37 off 27 balls from left-hander Ed Joyce helped Middlesex {{to a total of}} 239 for 5. Peter Trego then removed both openers, before Alex Wharf took him for runs (ending with 40 off 20 balls), and Trego ended with one maiden over, two wickets, and 31 runs off three overs. Wharf was eventually caught by Smith, but David Hemp, Dan Cherry and Richard Grant all added more than 30 in stands with Mike Powell, and at 219 for 5, Glamorgan needed 21 for the last five wickets. Styris had the last laugh, however, taking three wickets in the late overs and bowling Glamorgan out with eight balls remaining in their quota to leave Powell stranded on 83 not out.|$|E

500|$|The group {{moved to}} Los Angeles in early 1965 after Zappa got them a {{management}} contract with Herb Cohen. They gained steady work at clubs along the Sunset Strip. [...] MGM staff producer Tom Wilson offered the band a record {{deal on the}} Verve Records division in early 1966. He had heard of their growing reputation but <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> perform only one song, [...] "Trouble Every Day", which concerned the Watts riots.

500|$|The rioters next {{visited the}} {{premises}} of disabled 90-year-old Mr Sindall, throwing his furniture into the street; his housekeeper, Mrs Hutt, was intimidated by a rioter wielding a butcher's cleaver. After stopping at the place of Mr Little, [...] "a nice old gentleman," [...] who gave the mob £2 (£), they continued to Robert Speechly's and demolished his furniture. Next they broke into the house of Rebecca Waddelow looking for Harry Martin, her grandson. He <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> coming and escaped out the back.
