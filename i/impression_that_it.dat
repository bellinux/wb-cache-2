5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down to give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not have bumpers {{and that it was}} falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|During {{their field}} trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary {{arrives at the}} Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, {{knocking}} one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is {{a reference to the}} opening sequence of the television sitcom F Troop. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Üter is left behind {{at the end of the}} field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Because most of {{the newly}} formed {{regiment}} surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{marked the end of}} the regiment as a combat entity, {{a significant portion of the}} unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout {{most of the}} remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters of the Continental Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of the Continental Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
25|$|Saint Bonaventure, the seraphic doctor, is {{regarded}} as deeply penetrated and imbued with the mind of Saint Francis of Assisi.

5000|$|The {{title of}} the song, [...] "Life of the Party", may give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> an upbeat dance song, but in an interview, Mendes {{described}} the song as not [...] "super happy, but it's also not depressing". The lyrics represent being happy with yourself and figuring out {{who you are and}} who you want to be. It was written by two writers from New York, Ido Zmishlany and Scott Harris, though Mendes felt a strong connection to it.|$|R
25|$|The {{architecture}} of the trompe-l'oeil dome (illustration, left) seems to erase and raise the ceiling with such a realistic <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is difficult to distinguish what is real or not. Andrea Pozzo painted this ceiling and trompe-l'oeil dome on a canvas, 17 m wide. The paintings in the apse depict scenes {{from the life of}} St. Ignatius, St Francis Xavier and St Francis Borgia.|$|E

It is therefore right to take precautions against this possible cause of inaccuracy. The most perfect way would be to drop the weights, each in a little bag or sheath of light material, so that the operatee {{could not see the}} weights, while the ratio between the weights would not be sensibly changed by the additional weight of the bags.

25|$|It flies high, {{slowly and}} often descends to nectar on flowers below. On such {{occasions}} it often dives down with its wings held back, {{and as it}} approaches the flower, the wings open up to provide deceleration. The butterfly primarily depends on motive thrust on the powerful flapping of its forewings while the hindwings act as a balancing and steering mechanism. This flying technique gives a rather unusual look to its flight and an observer is left with the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is dragging itself through the air with only the assistance of its forewings.|$|E
25|$|Juan de Castilho, a Spanish {{architect}} and sculptor, continued the construction in 1517. He completed the retaining {{walls and the}} unique single-span ribbed vault, a combination of stellar vaulting and tracery vaults spanning the 19-metre-wide church. Each set of ribs in the vaulting is secured by bosses. The bold design (1522) of the transversal vault of the transept lacks any piers or columns, while Boitac had originally planned three bays in the transept. The transept's unsupported vault gives the visitor the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> floats in the air.|$|E
25|$|The movement's {{cloverleaf}} logo {{created the}} <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was a single}} organisation rather than independent organisations sharing common principles. The brand was strengthened by {{the creation of the}} Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG) in 1993, providing Co-op branded products and other food supplies to its members: by 2002, the CRTG provided 100% of food supplies sold by UK consumer co-operatives. Over time, the brand became tarnished by inconsistent customer delivery and image perceptions of the cloverleaf logo were irreparably damaged. Market research carried out in the early 2000s showed a consistent decline in consumer ratings.|$|E

Among criticisms leveled at Post was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was taken during her fatal act, {{despite the fact that she}} had fallen face up.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, the {{reservoir}} Lake Carnegie {{was created by}} Andrew Carnegie. A collection of historical photographs of {{the building of the}} lake is housed at the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library on Princeton's campus. On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated. In 1919 the School of Architecture was established. In 1933, Albert Einstein became a lifetime member of the Institute for Advanced Study with an office on the Princeton campus. While always independent of the university, the Institute for Advanced Study occupied offices in Jones Hall for 6 years, from its opening in 1933, until their own campus was finished and opened in 1939. This helped start an incorrect <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.|$|E
500|$|Although some of {{the great}} {{variability}} of B.integrifolia can be attributed to environmental factors, much is genetic: George writes that it [...] "gives the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is actively speciating to fill the many ecological niches through its range".

500|$|According to Baba, each soul pursues {{conscious}} divinity by evolving: that is, experiencing {{itself in}} a succession of imagined forms through seven [...] "kingdoms": stone/metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird, animal, and human. The soul identifies itself with each successive form, becoming thus tied to illusion. During this evolution of forms thinking also increases, until in human form thinking becomes infinite. Although in human form the soul is capable of conscious divinity, all the <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has gathered during evolution are illusory ones, creating a barrier for the soul to know itself. For this barrier to be overcome, further births in human form are needed in a process named reincarnation.|$|R

500|$|In 2015, a {{translation}} of the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published, wherein he described the bird as [...] "very beautifully coloured". Hume accordingly reinterpreted Hoffman's account, and suggested the bird may have been brightly coloured with a red body, blue head, and red beak; the bird was illustrated as such in the paper by Ria Winters. Possible iridescent or glossy feathers that changed appearance according to angle of light may also have given the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had even more colours. It has also been suggested {{that in addition to}} size dimorphism, the sexes may have had different colours, which would explain some of the discrepancies in old descriptions.|$|E
500|$|... "The Baby Shower" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on November 20. A technique called [...] "Poor Man's Process" [...] was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members would shake the car to give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed {{to give the impression that}} there was a car behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|For its time, Witchfinder General was {{considered}} an unusually sadistic film experience. British film censor John Trevelyan was reportedly a distant cousin of Michael Reeves and accepted the director's good intentions when Reeves explained why {{he felt it was}} necessary to include such intense violence in the movie. Trevelyan nonetheless argued, [...] "The film gave the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons." [...] Consequently, the film was cut extensively by the British Board of Film Censors for its UK release. Nearly two complete minutes of what was described as [...] "excesses of sadistic brutality" [...] were removed. Reeves agreed to make some of the initial minor cuts himself, but when additional and more extensive demands were made he adamantly refused to take part in any further editing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book has}} faced {{criticism}} {{due to the}} Driscolls' detailed and frank discussion of sex in Real Marriage. The Driscolls have stated {{that they did not}} write the book for people looking to read the book for [...] "voyeuristic" [...] intents, but because they viewed sex as an important part of marriage and that the majority of marriage help books were written for people who had not [...] "experienced sexual assault or been abused or exposed to pornography or sexual sins". The book has also been criticized for content such as chapters entitled [...] "The Respectful Wife", with critics stating that the book was [...] "an astoundingly unbelievable work of disrespect for women" [...] and that [...] "the book focuses so much on sex <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can create the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> the most important element of marriage".|$|R
