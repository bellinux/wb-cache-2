40|$|The {{perception}} of silent pauses in continuous speech was investigated experimentally in three genres: political speeches, political interviews and casual interviews. Normal and <b>inverted</b> <b>speech</b> yielded similar perception. The result is interpreted {{as being an}} indicator of the salient role of the prosodic structures. The distributional patterning of pauses proves to be responsible for the variability of perception. Pause duration is the essential parameter; pause identification rate is positively correlated with it, and it interacts with the parameter values of the vowel preceding the pause...|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{inversion}} is more detrimental to the perception of faces than to the perception {{of other types of}} visual stimuli. Inverting a face results in an impairment of configural information processing that leads to slowed early face processing and reduced accuracy when performance is tested in face recognition tasks. We investigated the effects of <b>inverting</b> <b>speech</b> and non-speech stimuli on audiovisual temporal perception. Upright and inverted audiovisual video clips of a person uttering syllables (experiments 1 and 2), playing musical notes on a piano (experiment 3), or a rhesus monkey producing vocalisations (experiment 4) were presented. Participants made unspeeded temporal-order judgments regarding which modality stream (auditory or visual) appeared to have been presented first. Inverting the visual stream did not have any effect on the sensitivity of temporal discrimination responses in any of the four experiments, thus implying that audiovisual temporal integration is resilient to the effects of orientation in the picture plane. By contrast, the point of subjective simultaneity differed significantly as a function of orientation only for the audiovisual speech stimuli but not for the non-speech stimuli or monkey calls. That is, smaller auditory leads were required for the inverted than for the upright-visual speech stimuli. These results are consistent with the longer processing latencies reported previously when human faces are inverted and demonstrates that the temporal perception of dynamic audiovisual speech can be modulated by changes in the physical properties of the visual speech (ie by changes in orientation) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Inverting</b> the <b>speech</b> polarity, {{which is}} {{dependent}} upon the recording setup, mayseriously degradethe performanceof various speech processingapplications. Therefore,itsautomaticdetectionfromthespeech signal is thus required as a preliminary step for ensuring such techniques are well-behaved. In this paper a new method for polarity detection is proposed. This new approach relies on oscillating statistical moments which exhibit the property of having a phase shift which depends on the speech polarity. This dependency arises from the higher-order statistics in the moment calculation. The proposed approach is compared to stateof-the-art techniques on 10 speech corpora. Their performance in clean conditions {{as well as their}} robustness to additive noise are discussed...|$|R
60|$|Now Herd's version {{says nothing}} of Douglas at Newcastle; {{the whole scene}} is at Otterburn. On the other hand, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe's MS. text DID bring Douglas to Newcastle. Of this Colonel Elliot says nothing. The English version says NOTHING OF PERCY'S LOSS OF HIS PENNON TO DOUGLAS (nor does Sharpe's), and gives the {{challenge}} and tryst. Scott's version says nothing of Percy's pennon, but Douglas takes Percy's SWORD and vows to carry it home. Percy's challenge, in the English version, {{is accompanied by a}} gross absurdity. He bids Douglas wait at Otterburn, where, pour tout potage to an army absurdly stated at 40,000 men, Percy suggests venison and pheasants! In the Scottish version Percy offers tryst at Otterburn. Douglas answers that, though Otterburn has no supplies--nothing but deer and wild birds--he will there tarry for Percy. This is chivalrous, and, in Scott's version, Douglas understands war. In the English version Percy does not. (To these facts I return, giving more details.) Colonel Elliot supposes some one (Scott, I daresay) to have taken Percy's,--the English version,--altered it to taste, concealed the alterations, as {{in this part of the}} challenge, by <b>inverting</b> the <b>speeches</b> and writing new stanzas of the fight at Otterburn, used a very little of Herd (which is true), and inserted modern stanzas.|$|R
40|$|Using {{the voices}} of six subjects, {{representing}} various social and educational backgrounds, fifty-four synthetic voices were generated by computer. Each normal voice was both increased and decreased in rate by 121 / 2, 25, 371 / 2, and 50 per cent. Judges evaluated the fifty-four voices using a series of adjectives representing two major personality factors of " competence " and " benevolence ". Several statistical analyses were performed, and {{it was found that}} the competence factor was much more sensitive to rate manipulations than was the benevolence factor. Ratings of competence were found to increase as rate increases and decrease as rate decreases, in a linear fashion. Benevolence had an <b>inverted</b> U-relationship with <b>speech</b> rate; the highest benevolence ratings occurred with normal speech rate. The observation that vocal properties of speech seem to convey a certain amount of information concerning emotions and personality has prompted much research directed at determining which particular vocal qualities carry such information and to what extent. Allport and Cantril (1934) conducted numerous experiments to determine correlations between various voice and personality measures. Moses (1942...|$|R
40|$|Procedemos, a partir dos pressupostos da LingÃÃstica da EnunciaÃÃo, Ã problematizaÃÃo do quadro das heterogeneidades do tipo mostrada (marcada vs. nÃo-marcada), proposto por Authier-Revuz (1982). Nossa proposta {{consiste}} em sugerir que o escopo das ocorrÃncias dos fatos de heterogeneidade marcada seja flexibilizado, de modo a abarcar fenÃmenos de natureza (mais) cognitiva que evidenciam a presenÃa do alheio na materialidade lingÃÃstica num ponto especÃfico da cadeia do dizer, promovendo, destarte, uma articulaÃÃo entre heterogeneidade mostrada/marcada e referenciaÃÃo. Submetemos a um reexame, acrescentando o que nos pareceu pertinente, um conjunto de marcas que nÃo apenas as consagradas (como, por exemplo, negrito, mudanÃa de fonte, aspas, discurso direto) na tentativa de lhes conferir um estatuto de marcadores da presenÃa consciente do outro no fio discursivo, considerando a noÃÃo de leitor-modelo sugerida por Eco (1979). Para tanto, elegemos como categorias principais de anÃlise os processos referenciais anafÃricos e dÃiticos, o discurso indireto livre e a intertextualidade por alusÃo. Nossos resultados legitimaram nossa proposta e confirmaram o potencial marcativo de tais categorias. Palavras-chave: Heterogeneidade enunciativa; heterogeneidade mostrada/marcada; referenciaÃÃo; processos referenciais. We {{proceed to}} the problematization of the frame of heterogeneities of the displayed type (marked versus not marked) as proposed by Authier-Revuz (1982) from the assumptions of the Linguistics of Enunciation. Our proposal consists in suggesting that {{the scope of the}} occurrences of facts of marked heterogeneity be widened in order that it includes phenomena of a (more) cognitive nature that make evident the presence of the other in the linguistic materialization in a specific point of the chain of the saying and, besides, articulate the displayed marked heterogeneity and the referentiation. We reexamine, appending whatever seems to us pertinent, a set of marks, besides those already established (e. g., bold face, font changing, <b>inverted</b> commas, direct <b>speech)</b> in an attempt to confer them the statute of markers of the conscious presence of the other in the discursive thread, considering the notion of model reader suggested by Eco (1979). To achieve this goal, we choose for main categories of analysis the deictic and anaphoric referential processes, the free indirect speech and the intertextuality by allusion. Our results legitimize our proposal and confirms the marking potential of such categories.
