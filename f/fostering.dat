40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of children in family <b>foster</b> care and examines which characteristics related to the <b>foster</b> child, the <b>foster</b> family, and the <b>foster</b> placement are associated with <b>foster</b> children’s development. We used meta-analysis and longitudinal research to provide a better insight in <b>foster</b> children’s development. In sum, this dissertation clarifies that <b>foster</b> children vary greatly with respect to their developmental functioning. We found several characteristics related to <b>foster</b> children’s development. Although these characteristics partly explain <b>foster</b> children’s development and thereby provide useful insights, they cannot explain the total variance in <b>foster</b> children’s development. It is both this lack of an accurate model for <b>foster</b> children’s development and the heterogeneity of developmental trajectories that lend significance to screening and monitoring of <b>foster</b> children’s development. We advise <b>foster</b> care agencies to systematically implement screening and monitoring measures in order to capture <b>foster</b> children’s developmental diversity. This enables timely identification of those <b>foster</b> children who experience developmental difficulties and are therefore at risk for negative developmental trajectories and breakdown. Researchers and <b>foster</b> care professionals should establish collaborations in order to improve the validity as well as the feasibility of screening and monitoring children in <b>foster</b> care...|$|R
40|$|<b>Foster</b> {{families}} face great {{challenges that}} impact all members. <b>Foster</b> parents confront unique struggles in providing {{care for a}} difficult population and in working for the <b>foster</b> care system. They can be essential {{to the success of}} their <b>foster</b> children and to the <b>foster</b> care system. However, little research has been conducted that directly addresses the experiences of <b>foster</b> parents. Most of the limited research with <b>foster</b> parents has focused primarily on them as service providers to the <b>foster</b> care system. This study investigated the subjective meanings and experiences of <b>foster</b> parents to add to the understanding and awareness of this role. Twelve volunteer <b>foster</b> parents were interviewed about their experiences as <b>foster</b> care providers. A phenomenological approach to data analysis was used in search of shared meanings and themes of the <b>foster</b> care experience. Results encompassed four major themes, or superordinate categories: the struggles and systemic problems that <b>foster</b> parents experienced; changes and costs resulting from providing care; rewarding and positive aspects of being a <b>foster</b> parent; and methods for coping with stressors inherent in the <b>foster</b> parent role. The findings suggest that <b>foster</b> parents need better support, services, and training from the <b>foster</b> care system. Despite this need, however, <b>foster</b> parents also experience positive experiences and abundant rewards and satisfactions in their role...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore the {{potential}} influence of direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a pre-adoptive <b>foster</b> child on the decision of the prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parents to finalize or disrupt their adoption of the <b>foster</b> child. A quantitative survey was conducted using a sample of <b>foster</b> parents with three distinct statuses as a <b>foster</b> parent. They included, <b>foster</b> parents in the process of adopting their <b>foster</b> child, <b>foster</b> parents awaiting placement of a <b>foster</b> child in their home, and individuals in the process of completing training to become <b>foster</b> parents. The study participants were from a <b>foster</b> family agency that specializes in <b>foster</b> adoptions and all study participants had indicated they wanted to adopt a <b>foster</b> child. The <b>foster</b> family agency has two locations, one in Orange County and the other in San Bernardino County. Study data was collected through the use of a self-report questionnaire at five different <b>foster</b> family agency events. Twelve original survey questions were designed to measure three core areas: knowledge of prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parents on the information direct-to-consumer genetic testing can provide; attitudes of prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parents regarding the use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing as a pre-adoption screening tool; and, if direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> child influences the decision of prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parents to finalize or disrupt a <b>foster</b> adoption. Using SPSS software to analyze data, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analyses were conducted between the three different <b>foster</b> parent statuses and the four questions designed to measure the core area of if direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> child influences the decision of prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parents to finalize or disrupt a <b>foster</b> adoption. More than half of the survey participants, identified as women (n= 39, 54. 9 %) and 32 (23. 9 %) identified as men. Results showed that there was a significant relationship found between the direct-to-consumer genetic test results of a <b>foster</b> child to influence the prospective adoptive <b>foster</b> parent to stop adoption proceedings for the child with the status of <b>foster</b> parents awaiting placement of the first <b>foster</b> child into their home...|$|R
