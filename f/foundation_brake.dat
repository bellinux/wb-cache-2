40|$|Abstract: Using the {{powerful}} techniques of neural networks and genetic algorithms, a brake system controller is designed. First, {{the problem of}} blending auxiliary <b>brakes,</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>brakes</b> and gear for high mean speed in down hill cruising situations is investigated. An optimization problem with constraints such as vehicle speed and disc temperature is formulated and solved, resulting in a well performing controller even compared to experienced drivers. It is shown that the mean speed can be improved by controlling the whole brake system. Second, the issue of distributing a required force between auxiliary and <b>foundation</b> <b>brakes</b> {{in order to minimize}} wear cost of pad, disc, and tyres is investigated. The neural network controllers obtained from the optimization procedure significantly outperform the traditional strategy of using non-wear auxiliary brakes in order to minimize pad and disc wear cost...|$|R

ESC and RSC {{are two types of}} stability control systems that have been developed for heavy vehicles. RSC is designed to mitigate on-road, untripped truck rollovers by automatically decelerating the vehicle by applying the <b>foundation</b> <b>brakes</b> and reducing engine torque output. ESC includes the RSC function described previously but it has added capability that allows it to also mitigate severe oversteer or understeer conditions that can lead to vehicle loss-of-control (LOC), by automatically applying selective brakes to generate a yawing moment that helps the driver maintain directional contro...|$|R

40|$|A {{brake disc}} rotor forms pan of a <b>foundation</b> <b>brake</b> and rotates with the wheel hub assembly. The main {{function}} of a <b>foundation</b> <b>brake</b> is to generate a retarding torque by converting mechanical energy to thermal energy {{by virtue of the}} frictional work done in relative sliding at the rotor-pad interface. In practice, most brake discs arc made from cast iron and in use arc sometimes subjected to high thermal stresses which can lead to permanent plastic deformation and occasionally rotor cracking. The aim of the present work is to investigate the thermal response of such a cast iron brake disc using the finite element (FE) method. One particular existing brake disc design for a medium passenger car was chosen for the investigation. This is a "back-vented" disc designed to minimise disc coning but the present work also includes an investigation of a conventional "frontvented" disc similar in dimension to the back-vented disc but with different detailed geometry. Experimental work was undertaken to derive the rotor material properties in tension and compression as a function of temperature. This data was used to generate suitable FE material model routines which accurately allow for the different temperature-dependent yield properties of cast iron in tension and compression. The modelling work highlights the role of the rotor geometry in controlling the thermal response of the structure but. more importantly, the necessity for an accurate material model is illustrated, particularly with regard to its ability to predict the accumulation of plastic strain which may lead to rotor cracking. Using the most accurate user developed material subroutine, the thermal response of the back-and front-vented disc designs are compared: the back-vented disc suffers lower thermal distortion but at the expense of higher plastic strain accumulation, particularly near the point of attachment of the vanes...|$|E
40|$|An {{integral}} part of the development of a disc brake system is associated with the physical test of the <b>foundation</b> <b>brake</b> using a brake dynamometer. Testing undertaken at full scale is both costly and time consuming and recent work, for example Prabhu et al. (2015), has shown that reduced scale testing is capable of replicating the tribological conditions at the interface such that the thermal response of the rotor approaches that of its full scale counterpart. The same work also demonstrated experimentally the connection between pad aspect ratio and rotor response and this had been omitted from the formal scaling methodology. This paper extends the scaling theory to reflect the presence of pad aspect ratio {{through the use of a}} validated finite element model of the reduced scale brake. The results show that for the given reduced scale brake, there exists a pad aspect ratio at which the thermal response of the rotor is at a minimum. The conclusions drawn apply equally to the behaviour of the rotor at full scale...|$|E

The front wheels had double wishbone independent suspension and like the rear axle had a self-levelling air suspension system, the <b>foundation</b> <b>braking</b> was by disc brakes on all four wheels with a drum brake on the driveshaft providing the parking brake and the fluid flywheel adapted to serve as an integral retarder. At a time when only Jaguar and Ferrari road cars had front discs this was a technological adventure, like the AEC Routemaster and Midland Red's motorway coach it was shown with its Roe body in a cutaway-centre spread of boy's comic The Eagle where it took its place alongside V-Bombers, nuclear submarines and Deltic locomotives.

40|$|In this thesis, {{downhill}} driving {{strategies that}} co–ordinate the different brake actuators in heavy duty vehicles have been developed. As a starting point, the vehicle features {{affected by the}} retardation system are investigated. The main conclusions are that the retardation power demand will increase {{in the future and}} that, therefore, optimization of the brake systems will come to play a major role. In particular, strategies for the integration of <b>foundation</b> <b>brakes,</b> auxiliary brakes, and gear box have to be developed. Furthermore, these strategies must take component wear cost into consideration. Additionally, a thorough description of the current situation in terms of driver behaviour and existing systems for driver assistance is given. Optimal control and nonlinear programming have been used for the generation of open–loop optimal driving strategies. Two different methods have been employed for the generation of implementable, closed–loop, driving strategies. First, a method that utilizes neural networks and genetic algorithms is presented. Second, in order to further enhance the controller transparency, and the possibility for robust implementation, the control problem is divided into two differentmodes of operation. Linear quadratic control using gain scheduling is then utilized for the controller design and generation of actuator reference values. Comparison with the open–loop optimal strategies is also made. It is shown that transport efficiency (i. e. mean speed) and retardation economy (i. e. component wear cost) can be improved significantly, even compared to what skilled drivers can achieve, by integrating the whole retardation system. It is furthermore shown that there is a trade–off between component wear cost and transport efficiency that must be balanced in order to achieve good brake performance. The main parameters that affect the longitudinal control of the vehicle are the level of vehicle utilization (mass) and road slope. Algorithms for estimation of vehicle mass and road slope are therefore developed and presented. Additionally, a downhill driving strategy is implemented and verified in a real truck...|$|R

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems in {{cars and trucks}} are getting ever more sophisticated {{with an emphasis on}} improving fuel efficiency, safety, and driver convenience. In a few years advanced navigation systems that can provide detailed real-time information about the road ahead are expected to become available. For this reason, it is important to investigate how assistance systems can be improved when this type of information becomes available. In this thesis, the assignment is to improve an existing cruise control algorithm using foundation brakes by integrating information about the road ahead. The goal is that the behavior should resemble that of an experienced truck driver. By doing this, the algorithm assimilates potential energy available in downhill slopes. At the same time, speed conditions must be fulfilled and the brakes should be used in an effective way. An algorithm has been developed that achieves the desired behavior. Before entering a descent, the speed is allowed to drop down to a defined minimum speed. When in the slope, the auxiliary brakes are used continuously while the foundation brakes are used for short periods of time when the speed reaches a defined maximum value. The brakes are controlled so that the vehicle leaves the slope at the maximum allowed speed. In order to avoid brake disc wear and, in worst case, a sudden reduction of the brake capacity, the brake disc temperature is monitored. If necessary, the speed is reduced to reduce the utilization rate of the foundation brakes. The results show that the behavior of an experienced driver can be approximated when introducing preview information in to the cruise controller algorithm. It has further been shown that the algorithm has the potential to reduce the <b>foundation</b> <b>brake</b> use with up to 10 % in specific scenarios, compared to an existing cruise controller. The same comparison shows that the developed algorithm assimilates more available energy due to the speed reduction before a slope starts. This is achieved with only small effects on the average speed...|$|E

40|$|The report {{summarizes}} what transpired during brake linings-related workshop {{held at the}} Fall 2003 {{meeting of}} the Technology and Maintenance Council (TMC) in Charlotte, NC. The title of the workshop was ''Developing a Useful Friction Material Rating System''. It was organized by a team consisting of Peter Blau (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Jim Britell (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), and Jim Lawrence (Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association). The workshop was held {{under the auspices of}} TMC Task Force S 6 (Chassis), chaired by Joseph Stianche (Sanderson Farms, Inc.). Six invited speakers during the morning session provided varied perspectives on testing and rating aftermarket automotive and truck brake linings. They were: James R. Clark, Chief Engineer, <b>Foundation</b> <b>Brakes</b> and Wheel Equipment, Dana Corporation, Spicer Heavy Axle and Brake Division; Charles W. Greening, Jr, President, Greening Test Labs; Tim Duncan, General Manager, Link Testing Services;Dennis J. McNichol, President, Dennis NationaLease; Jim Fajerski, Business Manager, OE Sales and Applications Engineering, Federal Mogul Corporation; and Peter J. Blau, Senior Materials Development Engineer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The afternoon break-out sessions addressed nine questions concerning such issues as: ''Should the federal government regulate aftermarket lining quality?''; ''How many operators use RP 628, and if so, what's good or bad about it?''; and ''Would there be any value to you of a vocation-specific rating system?'' The opinions of each discussion group, consisting of 7 - 9 participants, were reported and consolidated in summary findings on each question. Some questions produced a greater degree of agreement than others. In general, the industry seems eager for more information that would allow those who are responsible for maintaining truck brakes to make better, more informed choices on aftermarket linings. A written fleet operator survey was also conducted during the TMC meeting. Twenty-one responses were received, spanning fleet sizes between 12 and 170, 000 vehicles. Responses are summarized in a series of tables separated into responses from small (100 or fewer powered vehicles), medium (101 - 1000 vehicles), and large fleets (> 1000 vehicles). The vast majority of fleets do their own brake maintenance, relying primarily on experience and lining manufactures to select aftermarket linings. At least half of the responders are familiar to some extent with TMC Recommended Practice 628 on brake linings, but most do not use this source of test data as the sole criterion to select linings. Significant shortfalls in the applicability of TMC RP 628 to certain types of brake systems were noted...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{requirements of}} the ventilation systems for mines, power stations, wind tunnels and road tunnels regarding safety and economic efficiency, involve the application of Axial Fan ventilation systems. To achieve this demand requires an efficient, capable and well-organized Risk management embedded in a Project management in all internal departments of Howden Ventilatoren GmbH and a reliable and well-organized interface between the customer and the Project management team of Howden Ventilatoren GmbH This research provides a general insight into {{the whole process of}} Risk management and Project management at Howden Ventilatoren GmbH, Germany, from the handover of a project from the Sales department until the shipping of the complete ventilation system through the Project management. During the kick-off meeting with the Sales department, the project will be outlined in scope of delivery, technical and financial characteristics, erection details and the scheduled delivery date of the Axial Fan. After the kick-off meeting, the Project management have to study the existing contract, develop all bills of materials and create the new project in an Enterprise Resource System (Microsoft Dynamics AX). All the different components are assigned to the Construction departments in charge of the rotating and static components as well as the auxiliary components like cooling fans, <b>foundation</b> parts, <b>brake</b> systems and hydraulic piping. All auxiliary components will be designed, developed and purchased by the Project management. Furthermore, the new established Risk management at Howden Ventilatoren GmbH evaluate upcoming risks with the new Axial Fan project. During the entire project, the Project management have to establish a relationship with the customer and keep the customer up to date in all related facets of the project. Additionally the Project management have to communicate the interface between all internal departments as well to external vendors. During the lifecycle of the new project, all upcoming or existing risks have to be treated and recorded by the Risk management in an internal Risk databank. Howden Ventilatoren GmbH, based in Heidenheim, Germany, faces a new market in the Russian Federation as well as in Belarus. Since 2005 Howden Ventilatoren GmbH delivered seven mine ventilation systems to the Russian Federation and Belarus. The erection site in the Russian Federation is located in the region of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, approximately 300 km above the Arctic Circle. The region of Krasnoyarsk around the northernmost city called Norilsk has approximate 300, 000 inhabitants and has exceedingly abundant natural sources of copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum ore, stone coal and other ores for industrial use. The latest system that was delivered for the mine Skalisty VS 10 had an impeller diameter of 5, 4 metres and a hub diameter of 3, 55 metres. The total weight of the ventilation system was 70 tons. The required input power was 8 MW. The maximum volume flow was 870 m 3 /s and the minimum operating temperature was - 56 °C. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
