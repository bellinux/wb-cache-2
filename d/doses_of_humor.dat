5000|$|The paper {{tempered}} {{serious political}} analysis with ample <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> and The Rag provided a primary forum {{for two of}} the most important of the Sixties underground graphic artists - Gilbert Shelton, whose iconic Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comix would be republished in papers all over the world, and Jim Franklin, whose surrealist armadillos helped create what writer Hermes Nye called [...] "the Great Armadillo Cult." [...] Austin, long a haven for bohemians and iconoclasts, was also the center of a very active left political community based at the University of Texas campus and was {{a major player in the}} massive Sixties drug and music culture - incubating talents like Janis Joplin and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and some of the pioneering psychedelic poster and comix artists. And The Rag united those communities into a potent political force.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} at its initial release were largely positive. Variety said that Dumbo was [...] "a {{pleasant}} little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique". Cecilia Ager, writing in PM, called Dumbo [...] "the nicest, kindest Disney yet", and Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, said that the film was [...] "the most genial, the most endearing, the most completely precious cartoon feature film ever {{to emerge from the}} magical brushes of Walt Disney's wonder-working artists". TIME responded to the reception of the film with plans to name the character as its [...] "Mammal of the Year" [...] (a play on its annual [...] "Man/Person of the Year" [...] honor), with an appearance {{on the cover of the}} magazine's edition of December 29, 1941. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 of that year shifted the news cycle away from Dumbo, although the previously planned essay on the film, with a more appropriate introduction, appeared in the December 29 issue's [...] "Cinema" [...] section.|$|E

Danilo Gentili naturally seem to know the recipe of the genre: originality, surprise, charisma and connection with the audience, these are the perfect ingredients for a good <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> the one <b>of</b> the best medicine there is.

40|$|When {{he was out}} playing Indian, {{enacting}} Hollywood-inspired scenarios, {{it never}} occurred to the child Roger Welsch that the little girl sitting next to him in school was Indian. A lifetime of learning later, Welsch’s enthusiasm is undimmed, if somewhat more enlightened. In Embracing Fry Bread Welsch tells the story of his lifelong relationship with Native American culture, which, beginning in earnest with the study of linguistic practices of the Omaha tribe during a college anthropology course, resulted in his becoming an adopted member and kin of both the Omaha and the Pawnee tribes. With requisite humility and a healthy <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> Welsch describes his long pilgrimage through Native life, from lessons in the vagaries of “Indian time” and the difficulties of reservation life, to the joy of being allowed to participate in special ceremonies and developing a deep and lasting love of fry bread. Navigating another culture is a complicated task, and Welsch shares his mistakes and successes with engaging candor. Through his serendipitous wanderings, he finds that the more he learns about Native culture the more he learns about himself—and about a way of life whose allure offers true insight into indigenous America...|$|R
500|$|For certain reviewers, {{the tone}} and style {{reinforced}} the novel's quality.

[...] Kirkus Reviews compared {{the tone and}} plot of the story {{to that of a}} film directed by Preston Sturges or Frank Capra, describing how it [...] "has an unconventional style and offbeat sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that will delight readers or exhaust them, depending on their tolerance for screwball comedies." [...] Nancy Hinkel, then Associate Editor at Alfred A. Knopf and Crown Books for Young Readers, wrote that the story has [...] "great writing, original ideas, and real style" [...] as well as [...] "a good <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>humor</b> that slips past if you're not paying attention."

5000|$|The film {{received}} {{below average}} reviews from critics. The Times of India wrote, [...] "If double-meaning, adult jokes are your cup of tea, you will enjoy this movie." [...] Indianexpress wrote, [...] "With a wafer-thin plot, the debutant director weaves together {{a string of}} incidents. At times, it seems more like a theater of the absurd, with quirky characters and scenes added on just for its bizarre humor quotient, rather than for its relevance to the plot." [...] Behindwoods wrote, [...] "To sum it up, Yaaruda Mahesh is a unidirectional product that targets youth with liberal <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>humor</b> but is not powerful enough to sustain the interests through {{the entire length of}} the film." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1998, ABC {{revived the}} series in a Saturday time slot. The role of Mr. Roarke was played by Malcolm McDowell and, in {{contrast}} to the first series, the supernatural aspect of his character and of Fantasy Island itself was emphasized from the start, along with a <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> dark <b>humor.</b> Director Barry Sonnenfeld, known for his work on The Addams Family movies, was a chief creative force on the new series. Another difference was that the new series was filmed in Hawaii instead of California. The remake followed the fantasies of at least two of Roarke's guests with an additional subplot involving members of his staff - usually Cal and Harry. Whereas the original series featured a separate writer and title for each subplot, the new series was written as several stories but featuring a unified theme and title.|$|R

50|$|Hasbro relaunched their G.I. Joe {{franchise}} with G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, {{which was}} supported by a Marvel Comics series of the same name. It was unique at the time in that it was a comic book series that was promoted on television commercials which also supported the toy line. This 155-issue series is considered {{to be one of the}} longest-running comic book tie-ins to a toy line. Much of its success is to be credited to Larry Hama, who wrote the entire series save for a few issues with guest writers. Rather than treating the stories as a mere promotion for the toys, Hama wrote the series with seriousness and infused it with <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> realism, <b>humor,</b> and drama. To keep the series up-to-date on military technology and terminology, Hama continuously read through technical manuals. Other than Transformers, no other series based on a toy line was able to duplicate its success. Notable artists include Herb Trimpe, Ron Wagner, Rod Whigham and Marshall Rogers.|$|R
40|$|Konsep The Tantri {{stories are}} ancient animal tales known for centuries {{throughout}} Asia (as the panchatantra) which have historical connections to Aesop’s fables. In Bali the tales were popularized in wayang kulit (shadow puppet) form by the Balinese dalang (shadow-master) I Wayan Wija in the 1980 s. Wayang (‘shadow’) Kulit (‘skin’) are flat leather puppets made from carved and painted rawhide. The wayang kulit form {{as it is}} performed on the islands of Java and Bali in Indonesia is at least 1000 years old and may have historical connections to shadow puppet forms known in India. The stories are primarily drawn from the Hindu Mahabharata and Ramayana but also include local legends (babad) and tales such as the Tantri stories. Wayang Kulit is a sacred genre, performed for special ceremonies and in the inner courtyards of Balinese temples. However, it is also mass entertainment and besides philosophical and religious instruction, wayang also includes a healthy <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> bawdy <b>humor</b> and manic fight scenes...|$|R
