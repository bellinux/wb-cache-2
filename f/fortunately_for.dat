5|$|Huggins {{invested}} {{in real estate}} holdings in Florida, although he sold them in 1926 (three years before the stock market crash, <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> him) as they took too {{much of his time}} away from baseball. He enjoyed playing golf and billiards in his spare time.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, the war would soon end.|$|E
5|$|The ZNDH's fighter {{force was}} poorly {{equipped}} in every respect, consisting of 12 ex-VVKJ machines including four Ikarus IK-2s, seven ancient Avia BH-33 Es and one Hawker Fury II. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> this ill-equipped force, {{there was no}} aerial opposition and some more modern fighter aircraft were received from 1942 onwards.|$|E
60|$|A decided chuckle, which {{sounded like}} a choke, from granny, <b>fortunately</b> called <b>for</b> attentions from the bride at this point.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll go to {{the kitchen}} and clean the silver spoons," [...] said Anne. [...] "That's a task which won't require much {{thinking}} <b>fortunately</b> [...] . <b>for</b> I COULDN'T think tonight. And it will pass the time." ...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the same}} chief, Acton {{took part in}} the Battle of Málaga (1704); but aspersions had been cast upon his bravery. <b>Fortunately,</b> however, <b>for</b> Acton, and others who {{underwent}} the same ordeal, a court martial silenced slander and exposed the fabrications. He was fully and honourably acquitted.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Invaders, one {{of their}} members Mike Shonsey managed to slip from the barn {{and was able to}} contact Governor Barber the next day. Frantic efforts to save the WSGA group ensued and two days into the siege Governor Barber was able to {{telegraph}} President Benjamin Harrison a plea for help late on the night of April 12, 1892.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} neutralise the Würzburg system by developing countermeasures against it, Jones {{and his team}} needed to study one of the systems, {{or at least the}} more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, one such site had recently been sighted by an RAF reconnaissance Spitfire from the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit during a flight over part of the French English Channel coast near Le Havre.|$|E
50|$|The fictional crash took lives; {{the real}} one <b>fortunately</b> didn’t. As <b>for</b> {{the causes of the}} two crashes, they are uncannily similar.|$|R
60|$|Cashel turned fiercely, and saw Mellish {{standing}} {{a little way}} off, sulkily watching him. Lydia took the opportunity, and left the place. As she retreated she could hear that they were at high words together; {{but she could not}} distinguish what they were saying. <b>Fortunately</b> so; <b>for</b> their language was villainous.|$|R
60|$|<b>Fortunately,</b> perhaps, <b>for</b> our negro, {{the chief}} {{came out of}} his hut at that moment and gave the signal for the hunters to advance, thus {{bringing}} the game and Ebony's aspirations to an abrupt end. The young men at once fell to the rear, and the whole party sallied forth into the forest.|$|R
5|$|Site {{testing for}} both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The {{construction}} of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the SDS/SUK and Mihailović's Chetniks remained under the overall command of Damjanovič {{as part of the}} Chetnik Šumadija Division. These Chetniks had been under the command of the SS since 12 December 1944. They crossed the river Soča and surrendered to the British Army near the Italian-Yugoslav border on 5 May 1945. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, they were interned as prisoners of war and other than a few senior officers, were not repatriated to Yugoslavia to face trial.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have also}} to report, general, that we, this morning before daybreak, {{captured}} a British officer {{on his way}} to Miranda, with despatches. We were <b>fortunately</b> halted <b>for</b> the moment, so that he was unaware of our presence until he rode into the midst of us. These are his despatches. I have not opened them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Finally, {{after several}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts, Panachaiki {{made it to}} the [...] "big" [...] division in 1969 and Davourlis' talent shone. However, the team was involved in a bribery scandal and sunk again to the lower division. <b>Fortunately</b> enough <b>for</b> Davourlis, they were back a year later and the Black Prince of Patras led Panachaiki's rise towards glory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fortunately,</b> the {{prognosis}} <b>for</b> patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.|$|R
5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered by the Arab army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege of two weeks. Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium suffered in the entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the Empire, news of a rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fortunately</b> - <b>for</b> {{the gentle}} reader {{will no doubt}} be anxious to follow in his {{footsteps}} - some particulars of his life may be gleaned from the public records. He was charged at the Staffordshire Assizes with housebreaking, wounding with intent to kill, and procuring the murder of one Thomas Page, who was cut to pieces while on his knees begging for his life.|$|R
60|$|Alan Fairford {{had never}} more {{difficulty}} {{in his life}} to subdue a first emotion, than he had to refrain from knocking down the crazy blockhead who had broken in upon him at such a moment. But the length of Peter's address gave him time, <b>fortunately</b> perhaps <b>for</b> both parties, {{to reflect on the}} extreme irregularity of such a proceeding. He stood silent, however, with vexation, while Peter went on.|$|R
60|$|<b>Fortunately,</b> however, <b>for</b> {{the young}} captain and his companion, the hole {{into which they}} had tumbled was not {{provided}} with the sharp sticks mentioned. The natives had just finished the opening when an officer had called upon them to leave the vicinity as it was getting dangerous, owing to the rapid advances made by the Americans. So the trap had been set with its most dangerous element lacking.|$|R
5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclave}} {{began on}} February 15, 1769. Initially only 27 cardinals participated. Zelanti, {{taking advantage of}} the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. In one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, but, <b>fortunately</b> <b>for</b> them, Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown-cardinal present in the early ballots, was able to join some neutral cardinals to block Chigi’s candidature.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
40|$|Non-stationary {{harmonic}} signals cannot be accuratelyrepresented by Fourier transform (FT). <b>Fortunately,</b> severalmethods <b>for</b> representing non-stationary {{harmonic signals}}exist including Fan-Chirp trasnform (FChT) or Harmonic transform(HT). This article {{is focused on}} the Harmonic transform andits computation. Estimation of slope of fundamental frequencychange between analysed segments is essential for computationof the HT. The slope is estimated using several realisations ofHT and comparing the spectral flatness. Optimisation of thisprocedure is presented in the article...|$|R
6000|$|... "My madcap brother," [...] she said, [...] "has left me, but I {{expect him}} {{back in a few}} minutes; <b>for,</b> <b>fortunately,</b> as {{anything}} pleases him for a minute, nothing has charms for him much longer." ...|$|R
50|$|The town of Burslem was <b>fortunately</b> {{prepared}} <b>for</b> {{a proper}} {{reception of the}} Banditti. A small troop of the 2nd Dragoon Guards had arrived there from Newcastle, {{under the command of}} Major Trench, and a large body of volunteers, from among the friends of law and social order of all classes of society, had been hastily organized as special constables, by the praiseworthy exertions of Samuel Alcock, Esq., the chief constable of Burslem.|$|R
5|$|All {{attempts}} {{to land on}} the southern side of the Meuse failed. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Guderian, the 1st Panzer Division succeeded in crossing the Meuse in the centre (see above). Once completed, it headed into the right (eastern) flank of the French at Donchery. Some of its units cleared the Meuse bend. Assault Engineers and 1st Panzer Division neutralised the guns at Bellevue Castle, and cleared the bunker positions along the Meuse River from the rear. The artillery falling on the 2nd Panzer Division's eastern flank was stopped. With the threat of artillery fire on its right flank removed, the units on the 2nd Panzer's left flank crossed the river and infiltrated the French positions opposite Donchery at 20:00. Heavy French fire continued from the bunkers in front of Donchery {{on the south side of}} the Meuse. It was not until 22:20, in darkness, that regular ferrying missions enabled the reinforcement of the German bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. <b>Fortunately</b> <b>for</b> Francis, another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
30|$|<b>Fortunately,</b> the {{crystals}} <b>for</b> pipermullesine C trifluoroacetate (3 a) were also obtained from methanol. The NMR data of 3 a (Table  3) {{and the result}} of its single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig.  3) confirmed the chemical structure of 3.|$|R
50|$|He {{stated in}} an interview, 'I joined as a sales {{representative}} after completing my graduation in business management. But I {{was interested in}} films, hence I joined as assistant director to director K Shankar. Meanwhile Minbimbangal unit was planning to produce 'Marmadesam' serial for Sun TV. I sent my bio-data to the company as I was interested in acting. I was <b>fortunately</b> selected <b>for</b> the 'Karuppu' role, {{which is the most}} crucial character in the serial. This was my first teleserial'.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Daniel Shungu, {{founder of}} UFAR, says that UFAR {{will now be}} able to bring lifesaving {{medicine}} to Ituri Nord and Lubutu, in Oriental and Maniema provinces, respectively. [...] "I thank Sightsavers on behalf of UFAR and especially for those in the two new regions whose lives will be positively changed forever {{as a result of this}} arrangement. We have a few more challenges to face but, <b>fortunately,</b> finances <b>for</b> these two projects will not be one of them," [...] he says.|$|R
