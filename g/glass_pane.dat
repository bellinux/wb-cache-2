That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{steel is}} a {{material}} {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, slender steel columns usually have a low load bearing resistance due to flexural buckling. It is possible to suppress flexural column buckling by adding <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Thus, use can {{be made of the}} steel section’s squash load reducing the amount of steel involved and obtaining a highly transparent glasssteel column. In this paper, a new type of slender transparent glass-steel column is proposed, consisting of a high strength steel bar supported in lateral direction by <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> Its feasibility is shown experimentally and numerically. It is also shown that the design has sufficient redundancy to allow for the loss of supporting <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> without a reduction of the load bearing capacity. The key design feature of this glass-steel column is the way the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are connected to the steel bar, namely by sliding steel sleeves to avoid direct stresses to occur in the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> due to axial column deformation...|$|R

Lola also {{narrowly}} misses the cyclist; the cyclist instead offers his bike to the homeless man in a restaurant, who uses Manni's money to buy it. Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad on time. Since Lola can no longer speak to her dad, she continues running until she encounters a casino. Having only 99 marks, she convinces the cashier to give her a 100 mark chip. Betting the chip on a roulette table, she wins two consecutive bets, raising 126,000 marks. The people in the casino are shocked to see her win. Approaching the ambulance from behind, Lola climbs inside as it avoids the <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Recognizing the patient inside as a security guard from the bank, Lola realizes he has suffered a heart attack. She holds his hand to calm him and, to the doctor's surprise, his heart rate immediately becomes normal.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the <b>glass</b> <b>panes.</b> A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional insulating glazing. However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> and failure of the edge seal. A flexible edge seal has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible edge seals is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Geiger and Marsden then tested how the {{scattering}} varied with {{the thickness of}} the foil (i.e. if s ∝ t). They constructed a disc (S) with six holes drilled in it. [...] The holes were covered with metal foil (F) of varying thickness, or none for control. [...] This disc was then sealed in a brass ring (A) between two glass plates (B and C). [...] The disc could be rotated by means of a rod (P) to bring each window in front of the alpha particle source (R). On the rear <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> was a zinc sulfide screen (Z).

A continuous canted ledge of painted redwood stretched around the house below the second floor windows. Additional redwood trim was employed in rectangles to wrap around each corner on the second floor. [...] All windows and doors in the home were fashioned in leaded glass with nickel caming. The unvarying glass pattern was a variation of the typical Prairie muntin bar design and consisted of a frame of narrow rectangular and trapezoidal panes surrounding a single large <b>glass</b> <b>pane.</b> Wright arranged most windows into one of two ensembles – one for each floor – to unify his design. In five locations on the first floor, double casement windows or full length French doors were flanked by two more isolated, narrow casements. All openings on the second floor were composed of paired casements topped by a single transom light. A cantilevered, rectangular bay, which formed a focal point on the second level of the street (east) elevation, contained a band of four such three-piece windows and was subtly bookended by two deeply inset casements.|$|E

60|$|The {{train was}} late, {{and it was}} past ten o'clock when they at last {{appeared}} before the concierge of Helen's home. During their journey, and while passing though the crowds at the station and in the streets, Ostrander had exhibited a new and grave guardianship over the young girl, and, on the first landing, after a scrutinizing and an almost fierce glance at {{one or two of}} Helen's odd fellow lodgers, he had extended his protection so far as to accompany her up the four flights to the landing of her apartment. Here he took leave of her with a grave courtesy that half pained, half pleased her. She watched his broad shoulders and dangling sleeve as he went down the stairs, and then quickly turned, entered her room, and locked the door. The smile had faded from her lips. Going to the window, she pressed her hot forehead against the cool glass and looked out upon the stars nearly level with the black roofs around her. She stood there some moments until another star appeared higher up against the roof ridge, the star she was looking for. But here the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> before her eyes became presently dim with moisture; she was obliged to rub it out with her handkerchief; yet, somehow, it soon became clouded, at which she turned sharply away and went to bed.|$|E
60|$|Blandford hitched his {{steaming}} {{horse to}} a sleet-covered horse block {{with a quick}} sigh of impatient sympathy over the animal and himself, and after fumbling in his pocket for a latchkey, opened the front door. A vista of well-ordered obscurity with shadowy trestle-like objects against the walls, and an odor of chill decorum, as if of a damp but respectable funeral, greeted him on entering. A faint light, like a cold dawn, broke through the <b>glass</b> <b>pane</b> of a door leading to the kitchen. Blandford paused in the mid-darkness and hesitated. Should he first go to {{his wife in the}} back parlor, or pass silently through the kitchen, open the back gate, and mercifully bestow his sweating beast in the stable? With the reflection that an immediate conjugal greeting, while his horse was still exposed to the fury of the blast in the street, would necessarily be curtailed and limited, he compromised by quickly passing through the kitchen into the stable yard, opening the gate, and driving horse and vehicle under the shed to await later and more thorough ministration. As he entered the back door, a faint hope that his wife might have heard him and would be waiting for him in the hall for an instant thrilled him; but he remembered it was Sunday, and that she was probably engaged in some devotional reading or exercise. He hesitatingly opened the back-parlor door with a consciousness of committing some unreasonable trespass, and entered.|$|E
60|$|In November, when cold winds {{came down}} and snow had fallen on the mountains, {{from out of the}} storehouses the men were {{carrying}} timber, and we heard the clang of falling planks. Then, as we walked along the military road on the mountain-side, we saw below, {{on the top of the}} lemon gardens, long, thin poles laid from pillar to pillar, and we heard the two men talking and singing as they walked across perilously, placing the poles. In their clumsy zoccoli they strode easily across, though they had twenty or thirty feet to fall if they slipped. But the mountain-side, rising steeply, seemed near, and above their heads the rocks glowed high into the sky, so that the sense of elevation must have been taken away. At any rate, they went easily from pillar-summit to pillar-summit, with a great cave of space below. Then again was the rattle and clang of planks being laid in order, ringing from the mountain-side over the blue lake, till a platform of timber, old and brown, projected from the mountain-side, a floor when seen from above, a hanging roof when seen from below. And we, on the road above, saw the men sitting easily on this flimsy hanging platform, hammering the planks. And all day long the sound of hammering echoed among the rocks and olive woods, and came, a faint, quick concussion, to the men on the boats far out. When the roofs were on they put in the fronts, blocked in between the white pillars withhold, dark wood, in roughly made panels. And here and there, at irregular intervals, was a panel of <b>glass,</b> <b>pane</b> overlapping pane in the long strip of narrow window. So that now these enormous, unsightly buildings bulge out on the mountain-sides, rising in two or three receding tiers, blind, dark, sordid-looking places.|$|E
50|$|Windows play a {{significant}} role in room comfort. As a result, the area of glazing of buildings is constantly being increased. Window technologies always in progress and it is common today to use low-emissive glass. In spite of progress the low temperature of glass surface is still the problem of constructive glazing. Heatable glass helps to solve problems concerning low surface temperature and increase the level of comfort in the room significantly. Heatable glass can be used in practically all kinds of glazing systems made of wood, plastic or aluminum. Heatable glass and multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> can be used both in blind and openable constructions. Multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> made of heating glass can have one or two chambers. The advantages of multiple <b>glass</b> <b>panes</b> are their hermiticity and ability to decrease heat transfer significantly.|$|R
