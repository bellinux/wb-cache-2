50|$|The {{final three}} lines are only used by bash, {{to call the}} main <b>function.</b> <b>In</b> <b>PHP</b> the main <b>function</b> is defined but not called and in C {{there is no need}} to {{explicitly}} call the main function.|$|R
5000|$|Disabling common code {{execution}} vectors: the eval keyword isn't a real <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>php,</b> thus it can't be disabled {{with the}} disable_function directive, but suhosin added this possibility, and also allowing to disable the infamous /e operator for the preg_replace function {{that can lead}} to arbitrary code execution.|$|R
50|$|Node.js is {{primarily}} {{used to build}} network programs such as Web servers. The biggest difference between Node.js and PHP is that most <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>PHP</b> block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands have completed), while <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> Node.js {{are designed to be}} non-blocking (commands execute in parallel, and use callbacks to signal completion or failure).|$|R
500|$|<b>In</b> lieu of <b>function</b> pointers, <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>PHP</b> can be {{referenced}} by {{a string}} containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as callbacks or within function tables. User-defined functions may be created {{at any time}} without being prototyped. Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a run-time {{decision as to whether}} or not a function should be defined. There is a function_exists function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class constructor functions called with the <b>PHP</b> operator new, <b>in</b> which case [...] parentheses are optional.|$|R
50|$|Previous eAccelerator {{versions}} {{also provided}} <b>functions</b> for use <b>in</b> <b>PHP</b> scripts that allow access to shared memory, automatic web (content) caching, {{and other related}} tasks. These were removed as of version 0.9.6rc1.|$|R
40|$|My work {{is focused}} on design and {{execution}} of an automated translation for <b>functions</b> written <b>in</b> <b>PHP</b> into C++. Generated code may be compiled as a PHP extension and loaded the same way MySQL, PDO, GD or so. As a result these functions may be called from PHP {{as if they were}} the initial interpreted functions. Since there is no need for source code analysis, interpretation, nor staging by Garbage Collector general assumption would be a significant speed difference. Created tool executes source code transfer into abstract syntactic tree which is followed up by a static analysis of variable types and consequently generates C++ code. Final speed increase then depends on the particular code being translated and its practical use is slightly elaborate at the moment - owing to the implementation of PHP subset...|$|R
40|$|This book/bachelors-thesis in {{mainly focused}} on showing the {{procedure}} for building an online business, regarding wib design and the programming needed for it. The online business I'm using for my thesis is one I founded {{with a couple of}} friends called Ã–land Design, which is an online platform for design students to get professional experience when they have free time, earning some money from the transaction [...] . No wait [...] . All 100 % of the money from the transaction. Why did I choose this for my Thesis (final project) ?,wll, it's actually kind of simple: I wanted to do something productive and helpful for the design world, so that college student can have a beautifully designed and easy to use tool for gaining experience designing stuff and making great contacts with the design leaders of tomorrow. My final project memory (or bacheors thesis) will be structured as any software development would. The steps I'm taking in developing this project will be next. 1. Functions. I will go throughly what the designers and companies vould expect and need from this website to consider it modern and easy to use. 2. Sotoryboard/UI. The user steps around the website. 3. Database (MySQL). Build an "Entity/Relation" diagram for sotring the application data. 4. Web destin (HTML 5 & CSS 3). Designing the webpage from front end to the modern techniques of respoonive design. 5. PHP Programming. Programming the website app <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>PHP</b> 5. 0. I wil comment roughly about the managerial part as it not the main focus of my project. But I will use some of the strategical management information when necessary...|$|R
