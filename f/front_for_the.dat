5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Palestine, Popular <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{branches}} {{of political parties}} on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats.

5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the National <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), {{in their effort to}} conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1979 Islamic {{revolution}} in Iran, in 1981 Bahraini Shī'a fundamentalists orchestrated a failed coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a front organisation, the Islamic <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shī'a cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Islām Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners during an international marathon for running bare-legged. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.|$|E

It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a flank guard on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern prong of the attack on the Czech capital.

5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
5|$|Jifna {{is governed}} by a village council {{consisting}} of ten members including the chairman. The council was founded in 1954, when a prominent resident, Nasri Ilias Samara, pressured the Jordanian authorities to recognize the institution, even though a village was normally required to have a population of at least 1,000 inhabitants for permission to establish a village council. The decision was approved by Jordan's then prime minister. Representatives from Jifna's largest families formed the original council's body, appointing Smara as chairman and Salim Issa Musleh as vice chairman. Jabi Na'im Kamil was elected as the chairman in 2005 and the Badil (Alternative) list—which represents a leftist alliance of the Democratic <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of Palestine and the Palestinian People's Party—won most of the council seats.|$|E

5|$|Mario Basler's free kick {{after six}} minutes opened the scoring for Bayern Munich. Bayern then {{had the chance}} to extend their lead with Mehmet Scholl hitting the post and Carsten Jancker the crossbar, forcing Peter Schmeichel to make {{numerous}} saves. In reaction to going a goal down, Ferguson substituted in Solskjær and Sheringham. As the game went to injury time, referee Pierluigi Collina indicated that three minutes would be played. In almost the last attack of the game, United won a corner, which Beckham took and goalkeeper Schmeichel went up <b>front</b> <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> ball was partially cleared by the Bayern defence before being played back to Giggs, who sent a low volley into the path of Sheringham, whose scuffed shot squeezed low inside the post.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iskra was a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} Soviet forces. From a military perspective, the operation eliminated {{the possibility of the}} capture of the city and a German–Finnish link up, as the Leningrad Front was now very well supplied, reinforced and able to co-operate more closely with the Volkhov <b>Front.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> civilian population, the operation meant that more food was able to reach the city, as well as improved conditions and the possibility of evacuating more civilians from the city. Breaking the blockade also had a significant strategic effect, although it was overshadowed by the surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad only a few days later. Notably, the first Tiger tank captured by the Soviets was taken during this battle. It was undamaged and evacuated by the Soviet forces for evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. Raised in 1914 {{as part of}} the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, the battalion was completely recruited from the state of Victoria and formed the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division. The battalion served during the Gallipoli campaign where it had the distinction of having four of its members awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1916, it was transferred to Europe, fighting in the trenches along the Western <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next two and a half years.|$|E

5|$|The Sihanouk Trail was a {{logistical}} {{supply system}} in Cambodia {{used by the}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and its National <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong) allies during the Vietnam War (19601975). Between 1966 and 1970, this system operated {{in the same manner}} and served the same purposes as the much better known Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) which ran through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos. The name is of American derivation, since the North Vietnamese considered the system integral to the supply route mentioned above. U.S. attempts to interdict this system began in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National <b>Front</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E
