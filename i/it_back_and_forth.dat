5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the argonaute protein was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound argonaute protein. Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth)</b> between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|E

5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} {{for much of}} the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or cobia (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E

500|$|Sunshine offered open fields, and {{the three}} Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood, playing Australian rules {{football}} in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys {{to play with a}} side-on stance and underlined the importance of orthodox batting technique, reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting the ball. They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, Bill Ponsford. Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height; {{he was one of the}} smallest children in the school. At the age of seven, Miller moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden that allowed the children to play sport. By this time, his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname Weedy. Miller's small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future career. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers and earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner, as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers, meaning that his opportunities with the bat were rare. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just [...] away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.Perry, p. 13. Like Miller in his backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was the first person to score two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.Perry, p. 14. Miller often practised for hours by himself; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Indoors, Miller developed a lifelong love of classical music through a cousin who liked to play Mozart. He played flute in the Elsternwick school band but could not read music.|$|E

"Tribute", [...] "memorial", or [...] "commemorative" [...] hacks {{note the}} arrival, passing, or anniversary of some {{noteworthy}} person, tradition, institution, or idea (e.g. the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia). [...] Another broad category of hacks contains strong elements of social commentary or street protest (e.g. [...] "Nth Annual Spontaneous Tuition Riot") about events on campus {{or in the}} world at large. [...] But the strongest element of many hacks is the sheer joy of conceptualizing something new, and then reifying it with effective engineering, both technical and social (e.g. installing a full-sized mockup solar-powered subway car on the parapet wall {{around the base of the}} Great Dome, and then driving <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> under remote wireless control from Killian Court, some five stories below, after sundown).|$|E
2500|$|Nelson's {{antelope}} squirrels are cautious when {{emerging from}} their burrows. They {{have a specific}} route that they follow when foraging for food. [...] If danger seems near, they will run into a burrow along their foraging route to get to safety. They move quickly and do not spend much time in one place. [...] They are particular about what they choose to eat and very rarely even waste time to pick up food they are not interested in. There are other features {{in addition to their}} quick movements that help keep them from danger. [...] They whitish color of the underside of their tail can be seen when they run. [...] The squirrels will curl their tail forward over their back and flick and twitch <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as it runs. [...] This movement can present the illusion of thistledown fluttering in the wind, which could be ignored by any potential predators.|$|E
2500|$|Two other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} Irwin's stories, Johnny {{and his brother}} Kenny, are actual people whom he knew as a child. When the all-white elementary school that Irwin attended in the 1960s was forced to integrate, he became classmates with Johnny Norrington, an African American. They became good friends despite lingering racial barriers. In his story [...] "The Rudiments" [...] on Banana Seat, Irwin describes an accident he caused while riding his bike {{on a visit to}} the Norringtons' all-black neighborhood. Genuinely afraid of retaliation, Irwin was whisked to safety by the boys' mother. On the album Bootsie in Season, Irwin recalls how he and Johnny managed to watch the movie Dr. Terror's House of Horrors together despite Johnny having to sit in the [...] "colored section" [...] in the balcony while Irwin watched from the level below. (The two boys would share a box of Milk Duds by throwing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the balcony and the floor.) Friendships that crossed the color barrier were unusual at the time and Irwin had to endure vicious taunts from other white children.|$|E

In fact, {{the two men were}} good friends and each other's {{greatest}} admirers. Benny and Allen often appeared on each other's show during the thick of the feud; numerous surviving episodes of both comedians' radio shows feature each other, in both acknowledged guest spots and occasional cameos. On one Christmas program Allen thanked Benny for sending him a Christmas tree, but then added that the tree had died. [...] "Well, what do you expect," [...] quipped Allen, [...] "when the tree is in Brooklyn and the sap is in Hollywood." [...] Benny in his eventual memoir (Sunday Nights at Seven) and Allen in his Treadmill to Oblivion later revealed that each comedian's writing staff often met together to plot future takes on the mock feud. If Allen zapped Benny with a satirization of Benny's show ("The Pinch Penny Program"), Benny shot back with a parody of Allen's early favorite, Town Hall Tonight. Benny's parody was [...] "Clown Hall Tonight." [...] And their playful sniping ("Benny was born ignorant, and he's been losing ground ever since") was also advanced in the films Love Thy Neighbor and It's in the Bag!.|$|E
