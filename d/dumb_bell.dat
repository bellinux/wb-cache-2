5000|$|Females are swollen, pear-shaped pearly {{white and}} sedentary. They deposit their {{eggs in a}} {{gelatinous}} mass, which usually protrudes from galled root tissue. Females of this nematode are completely endoparasitic. [...] Mature females of M. arenaria are identified by the cuticular markings in the perineal area, stylet length, punctations on the cuticle. [...] When describing the morphology of M. arenaria race1, Eisenback et al., (1981) reported that in females, the dorsal arch is flattened and rounded. The striae in the arch are slightly indented at the lateral lines and generally form a shoulder on the arch. The stylet is very robust and the cone and shaft are broad. The labial disc and lips are <b>dumb</b> <b>bell</b> shaped and it has large lateral lips that are separated from the medial lips and the head region. [...] In a study in Argentina, perineal patterns of 100 females from a population of M. arenaria, race 2 growing on tomato plants were analyzed and moderate morphological variations observed. The overall shape was rounded in most cases, but it was oval-shaped in a small proportion (4%). Forty-six percent of females showed low dorsal arch while 38% depicted a high dorsal arc, while the rest were intermediate. Lines in the post-anal region were smooth or wavy, continuous or broken, occasionally forming shoulders (18% of females). Wings were generally not observed. Phasmids were visible in 25% of the patterns and the mean distance between them was 24.33 ± 1.61 mm. Only seven out of one hundred females presented perineal patterns with lateral lines weakly demarcated by forked striae. Adult females were pyriform and lacking a terminal protuberance in the posterior area of the body. The female body lengths ranged between 465 mm and 1,129 mm. The excretory pore of the females was located closer {{to the base of}} the stylet than to the median bulb, at approximately 2-stylet lengths, in agreement with a typical M. arenaria specimen. The stylet was dorsally curved.|$|E

On the other hand, the use of semisolid billet poses additional difficulties about either proper alloy re-heating and die design, especially runner and gate system.

40|$|The host - guest {{chemistry}} of the isopolyoxometalate W 36 crown – like cluster is investigated. Previous reports {{showed that the}} cluster can specifically bind primary amines via a central binding pocket formed by six terminal oxo ligands on the all - inorganic, cation binding host. This assembly strategy was transformed to utilise the incorporation of long chain alkyl diammonium guest cations to physically define the supramolecular structure of the clusters with {{respect to each other}} and demonstrate the structure direction as a function of alkyl chain length. The systematic variation of chain length gave access to five unprecedented supramolecular assemblies. Diprotonated 1, 8 -diaminooctane molecules link the W 36 clusters into infinite 1 -D zig - zag chains whereas huge trimeric assemblies were observed for 1, 9 -diaminononane and 1, 10 -diaminodecane linkers. <b>Dumb</b> - <b>bell</b> shaped dimeric units as a result of direct centre – to - centre linkages between the W 36 clusters using diprotonated 1, 12 -diaminododecane were prepared and triply protonated bis(hexamethylene) triamine was employed to obtain linear 1 -D chains of directly connected W 36 cluster units. In an alternative approach, the linking of polyoxometalate – based secondary building blocks was investigated using transition metal linkers in organic solvents. It has been previously shown that Ag(I) is an excellent candidate due to its versatility and ability to readily adopt a wide variety of coordination environments. A series of novel architectures have been prepared including a supramolecular dimer based on decavanadate V 10, an interconnected 2 -D network incorporating the decatungstate species W 10, extensively interconnected systems based on the unique W 19 cluster and unusual, highly symmetrical frameworks incorporating non – classical Dawson type units SbW 18 and BiW 18. The newly discovered silver - tungstate systems, which feature varying degrees of attractive argentophilic silver - silver interactions, have proven to be effective precursors for the formation of interesting nano / sub - micro materials. For the ultimate study, three titanium embedded polyoxotungstates with unprecedented structural features are presented: a monotitanium containing tungstoantimonate featuring an unusual Ti=O 2 + moiety, a hexatitanium containing tungstoarsenate featuring a highly charged Ti 4 (H 2 O) 1016 + core and a decatitanium containing tungstoarsenate exhibiting the second largest structure of its type ever reported. Due to their highly unique nature, the systems have been fully investigated using DFT calculations yielding important results. The first cluster has been optimised with five sodium cations in the belt position, which in addition to reducing the high charge, influence a stabilisation of the antimony lone pairs. Furthermore, electrostatic potential calculations highlight the high electronegativity of the terminal oxygen on the single titanium centre, enhancing real potentiality as a reactive site for catalysis. The second cluster could also be isolated as an n-tetrabutylammonium salt and has been thoroughly investigated by ESI-MS studies providing direct information on the protonation state of the overall system. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} extended acid etching on microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of a etch and rinse adhesive system to sound vital dentin. Etching times of 5, 20 and 80 seconds {{was used to evaluate}} the µTBS on vital dentin with resin bonded composite [RBC] restoration (Esthet-XTM) which used a two step etch and rinse adhesive system(Prime Bond NTTM) for bonding. Methods: 26 premolars which were going to be extracted for orthodontic treatment were used for this experiment. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups based on the etch times and restored with RBC using two step adhesive and extracted in `Guarulhos University 2 ̆ 7 Brazil. After extraction, these teeth were sectioned (Microtome) in such a way to obtain 2 testing beams of 2 mm diameter from each tooth were obtained which were trimmed (CNC specimen former, University of Iowa, IA, USA) to a <b>dumb</b> <b>bell</b> shape and tested for the microtensile bond strength in University of Iowa. Out of 26 teeth, 46 beams were obtained. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-Kramer 2 ̆ 7 s test was used to determine whether there were significant differences in micro-tensile bond strength among three etching times under each condition. All tests had a 0. 05 level of statistical significance. SAS for Windows (v 9. 1, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) was used for the data analysis. Fracture mode was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Bond strengths in 20 seconds and 5 seconds groups were significantly greater than that observed in 80 seconds group, while {{there was no significant difference}} between 20 and 5 etching times. SEM showed majority of the failure was adhesive/ joint failure. Significance: The results in this In-vivo study are consistent with other in-vitro studies and thus bring an insight on the importance of duration of phosphoric acid application on dentin and extended etch times could compromise the bond strength of the restorations...|$|E
40|$|The low {{frequency}} {{variation in the}} three dimensional air temperature fields of two reanalyses and two model simulations are described. The data sets used are the monthly mean temperature fields for the NCAR Climate Simulation Model (CSM, Boville and Gent, 1998) 300 year run, a NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM 3, Kiehl et al., 1998) AMIP type simulation, and the NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF (ERA) reanalysis data sets. The variances and correlations are computed for the anomalies from the annual cycle for each data set. In general the reanalyses and models agree fairly well {{on the structure of}} the temperature variance. The models tend to have too much variance at the surface compared to the reanalyses. The CSMs poor simulation of the SST in the eastern Pacific leads to a much reduced variance in the Nino 3 region. The enhanced variability over land appears to affect the midlatitude simulation of the CSM in that the higher surface variability extends off the east coast of continents. This is not evident in CCM 3 and reanalyses where the SSTs are prescribed. At 200 hPa the CCM 3 and reanalyses all evince the <b>dumb</b> <b>bell</b> pattern straddling the Equator in the eastern Pacific attributed by Yulaeva and Wallace (1994) to ENSO variations. The CSM shows no such pattern. A CCM 3 integration using climatological SSTs displays more variance that the CSM in this region. Apparently the coupling to an ocean in the CSM suppresses the atmospheric model's variability in this locale. The correlations of the temperature fields with the surface air temperature show that the regions of subtropical subsidence are virtually uncorrelated to the surface at the 700 hPa level. The regions of the cold water off the west coast of continents evince decoupling with the surface at 850 hPa. In the region from 30 S to 30 N the zonal mean correlation falls to about 0. 7 below 800 hPa, with this value extending up to about 600 hPa in mid and upper latitudes. These characteristics are consistent across all the data sets. Thus, the variations of vertically integrated measures such as MSU temperatures need not agree with observations of surface air temperatures at the time scales examined here...|$|E
