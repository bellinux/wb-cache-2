2500|$|The new styling was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Richard A. Teague, who would go on to design the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of any American wagon, with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the top-line 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts. Car Life magazine titled its road test of the 1964 Rambler American: [...] "The Original Plain Jane Compact Car <b>Just</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Back</b> <b>From</b> the Beauty Parlor".|$|E
6000|$|Lemuel did {{not appear}} to Sewell till the evening of the day when the Evanses left town. It seemed as if he had waited till they were gone, so that he could not be urged to visit them. At first the {{minister}} scolded him a little for his neglect; but Lemuel said he had heard about them, and knew they were getting along all right. He {{looked as if he had}} not been getting along very well himself; his face was thin, and had an air at once dogged and apprehensive. He abruptly left talking of Evans, and said, [...] "I don't know as you heard what happened that night before the fire <b>just</b> after I <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> your house?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Gioeli also {{revealed}} in a 2002 interview regarding II {{that he had}} attempted to get the original Hardline line-up back together for both the new album and the Gods Festival. [...] "Deen was contacted first and although {{he was interested in}} doing it he was petrified that Neal would be angry if he did it. I contacted Neal directly and he was all in favor of doing solos on the record based on him liking the songs. I said, 'Play on what you like and the fans will love it.' I {{had no way of knowing}} how to get in touch with Todd. I think he was back on the road with David Lee Roth. I <b>just</b> recently <b>got</b> word <b>back</b> <b>from</b> our keyboard player Michael that Todd would have been interested doing the record. It's a real kick in the ass but hey he couldn't have anyway being on the road. I almost had the whole band back. I tried for the Hardline fans." ...|$|R
50|$|A large caravan of {{settlers}} {{attempt to}} cross the Oregon Trail. Breck Coleman (John Wayne) is a young trapper who <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to Missouri <b>from</b> his travels near Santa Fe, seeking to avenge {{the death of an}} old trapper friend who was killed the winter before along the Santa Fe Trail for his furs, by Red Flack (Tyrone Power, Sr.) and his minion Lopez (Charles Stevens). At a large trading post owned by a man named Wellmore, Coleman sees Flack and suspects him right away as being one of the killers. Flack likewise suspects Coleman as being somebody who knows too much about the killing. Coleman is asked by a large group of settlers to scout their caravan west, and declines, until he learns that Flack and Lopez were just hired by Wellmore to boss a bull train along the as-yet-unblazed Oregon Trail to a trading post north of Oregon, owned by another Missouri fur trader. Coleman agrees to scout for the train, so he can {{keep an eye on the}} villains and kill them as soon as they reach their destination. The caravan of settlers in their Prairie schooners would follow Wellmore's ox-drawn train of Conestoga Wagons, as the first major group of settlers to move west on the Oregon Trail. The film is set somewhere between 1837 and 1845. This is historically accurate, as the first major wave of settlers on the Oregon Trail was in 1843, although the details were completely different.|$|R
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

60|$|Consider {{therefore}} if, on this Wednesday morning, {{there is}} an affluence of Patriotism; if Paris stands a-tiptoe, and all Deputies are at their post! Seven Hundred and Forty-nine honourable Deputies; only some twenty absent on mission, Duchatel and some seven others absent by sickness. Meanwhile expectant Patriotism and Paris standing a-tiptoe, have need of patience. For this Wednesday again passes in debate and effervescence; Girondins proposing that a 'majority of three-fourths' shall be required; Patriots fiercely resisting them. Danton, who has <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> mission in the Netherlands, does obtain 'order of the day' on this Girondin proposal; nay he obtains further that we decide sans desemparer, in Permanent-session, till we have done.|$|E

I staid at the volcano about a week and witnessed the greatest eruption that has occurred for years. I lived well there. They charge $4 a day for board, and a dollar or two extra for guides and horses. I {{had a pretty good}} time. They didn't charge me anything. I have got back sick--went to bed as soon as I arrived here--shall not be strong again for several days yet. I rushed too fast. I ought to have taken five or six weeks on that trip.|$|E
60|$|And he departed. Of course I {{knew that}} he had been baiting me, his scent for the {{weaknesses}} of his friends being absolutely fiendish. I was angry because he had succeeded,--because he knew he had succeeded. All the morning uneasiness possessed me, and I found it difficult to concentrate on the affairs I had in hand. I felt premonitions, which I tried in vain to suppress, that the tide of the philosophy of power and might were starting to ebb: I scented vague calamities ahead, calamities I associated with Krebs; and when I went out to the Club for lunch this sense of uneasiness, instead of being dissipated, was increased. Dickinson was there, and Scherer, who had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Europe; the talk fell on the Citizens Union, which Scherer belittled with an air of consequence and pompousness that struck me disagreeably, and with an eye newly critical I detected in him a certain disintegration, deterioration. Having dismissed the reformers, he began to tell of his experiences abroad, referring {{in one way or another}} to the people of consequence who had entertained him.|$|E
