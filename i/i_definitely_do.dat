40|$|As IC {{technology}} advances rapidly, {{the dimensions}} of packages and PCBs are decreasing while the pin counts and routing layers keep increasing. Today, a high-performance PCB usually contains thousands of pins and more than ten signal layers. Moreover, the manufacturing constraints require all nets to be routed in the planar fashion and the designer requires nets in the same bus to be routed together without any other net. All these factors pose new challenges for the PCB routing problem, making the PCB routing so difficult that no commercial CAD software can provide an automatic solution. Today, all high-end circuit boards are routed manually, in a time-consuming manner. In this dissertation, we present new strategies for automatic PCB routing. In particular, we present novel algorithms for bus sequencing, pin assignment, bus planning, bus escape, and escape routing. ii This dissertation is dedicated to my wife, my parents and my parents-in-law and my two lovely kids, for their love and support. <b>I</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>did</b> not have enough time for them due to my study for the Ph.

Dorothy was by no means always repressive and severe. She could enjoy the comic aspect of things.

They were taken in by the American Friends Service Committee, where they changed the name of the magazine to F--- Thee. When Dorothy heard about this, she laughed out loud. [...] Gregory was a lesbian and member of the Lesbian Alumnae of Radcliffe College. [...] She observed: [...] While I was at the CW, I heard virtually no talk about sexuality of any kind... It was different in ’61-’62. I don’t doubt that such talk was going on then, but I didn’t join in it. Bob (Steed) and I acknowledged later that we were gay. I don’t know if any others did. I never talked with Dorothy about my sense of myself, my sexuality. In the mid-seventies I wrote a book that was in a way a coming-out story, and I sent a copy to Bob.
