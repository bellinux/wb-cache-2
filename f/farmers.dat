5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant <b>farmers.</b> Tenant <b>farmers</b> were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large <b>farmers</b> who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small <b>farmers</b> worked as labourers on the larger farms.

5|$|Both <b>farmers</b> and {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides <b>farmers</b> with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. <b>Farmers</b> can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect <b>farmers,</b> parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some <b>farmers</b> are neutral. One reason why <b>farmers</b> oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy <b>farmers</b> are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
