5|$|The {{treatment}} for ectropion {{varies depending on}} {{the severity of the}} condition. The only {{treatment for}} <b>entropion</b> is surgical, and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as <b>entropion</b> or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, <b>entropion,</b> microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Entropion</b> is the inward rolling {{of the eye}}lid, {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.|$|E
5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, <b>entropion,</b> microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} <b>entropion,</b> which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for <b>entropion,</b> and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Entropion,</b> {{found in}} about 3% of the breed, is the rolling {{in of the}} eyelids, which causes the eyelashes to irritate the eye. <b>Entropion</b> is a {{condition}} that often requires surgery to fix, but once corrected causes no future issues for the dog.|$|E
25|$|<b>Entropion</b> (eyelid folding inward) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in dogs, especially the Chow Chow, Shar Pei, St. Bernard, and Cocker Spaniel. Upper lid <b>entropion</b> involves the eyelashes rubbing on the eye, but the lower lid usually has no eyelashes, so hair rubs on the eye. Surgical correction is used in more severe cases.|$|E
25|$|They {{will also}} have {{certificates}} that their breeding animals do not have <b>entropion</b> or ectropion {{and that they have}} full and complete dentition with a scissor bite.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis* is {{inflammation}} of the conjunctiva. In dogs it is most commonly caused by mechanical irritation (such as by <b>entropion,</b> ectropion, or trichiasis), allergies, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Any bacterial infection is usually secondary.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcer, or {{ulcerative}} keratitis, is {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} cornea involving loss of its outer layer. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as <b>entropion,</b> distichia, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcers {{are one of}} {{the most}} common eye {{diseases}} in dogs. They are caused by trauma, detergent burns, and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as <b>entropion,</b> distichiae, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). There have been at least two cases where corneal ulceration was caused by canine herpesvirus.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, dry eye, or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Ulcers in the inferior nasal cornea {{may be caused by}} foreign material trapped under the third eyelid. <b>Entropion</b> or distichiae may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and sclera.|$|E
25|$|The {{very fast}} growth {{rate and the}} weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious {{deterioration}} of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) {{has been shown to be}} hereditary in the breed. They are susceptible to eye disorders called <b>entropion</b> and ectropion, in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that this is a major fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{conditions}} {{are a problem}} in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For this reason many of the national kennel clubs require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some {{of the most common}} conditions include hip dysplasia, seen in large breed dogs, von Willebrand disease, a disease that affects platelets that is inherited in Doberman Pinschers, <b>entropion,</b> a curling in of the eyelid seen in Shar Peis and many other breeds, progressive retinal atrophy, inherited in many breeds, deafness, and epilepsy, known to be inherited in Belgian Shepherd Dogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and St. Bernards.|$|E
25|$|Cancer, {{the most}} common being hemangiosarcoma, {{followed}} by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma, {{was the cause of}} death for 61.4% of American Goldens according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America, making it the breed's biggest killer. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%. Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs. Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are {{the most common}} eye disease, but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, distichiasis, <b>entropion,</b> corneal dystrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
500|$|Since Pugs lack longer snouts and {{prominent}} skeletal brow ridges, they {{are susceptible to}} eye injuries such as proptosis, scratched corneas, and painful <b>entropion.</b> They also have compact breathing passageways, leaving many prone to breathing difficulties or unable to efficiently regulate their temperature through evaporation from the tongue by panting. A Pug's normal body temperature is between [...] and [...] If this temperature rises to , oxygen demand is greatly increased and immediate cooling is required. If body temperature reaches , organ failure can occur. Their breathing problems can be worsened by the stresses of travelling in air cargo, which may involve high temperatures. Following the deaths of Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds, several airlines either banned their transport in cargo or enacted seasonal restrictions.|$|E

2500|$|Eye {{diseases}} {{are common in}} dogs. [...] Cataracts, canine glaucoma, and <b>entropion</b> are seen in dogs. [...] Canine-specific eye diseases include progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. [...] Injury to the eye can result in corneal ulcers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{common problem}} is a painful eye {{condition}}, <b>entropion,</b> in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. Untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery ("tacking" [...] the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Pei). In Australia, more than 8 in 10 Shar Peis require surgery to correct eye problems, contributing to them being the most expensive breed to insure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common eye issues that Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs face are distichiasis and <b>entropion,</b> with distichiasis {{being the most}} common issue. Distichiasis is the {{presence}} of extra eyelashes along the eyelid. Distichiasis has been reported in 19%, of the breed and {{in the vast majority of}} cases it is non-symptomatic and does not cause an issue for the dog. Extra eyelashes can be seen along the eyelid; sometimes extra eyelashes grow so that they irritate the eye. [...] Treatment varies from vet to vet, some choosing to freeze the affected hair follicles and others choosing to use electrocautery.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{health issues}} to which Boxers are prone include cancers, heart {{conditions}} such as aortic stenosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (the so-called [...] "Boxer cardiomyopathy"), hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy and epilepsy; other conditions that may be seen are gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), intestinal problems, and allergies (although these may be more related to diet than breed). <b>Entropion,</b> a malformation of the eyelid requiring surgical correction, is occasionally seen, and some lines have a tendency toward spondylosis deformans, a fusing of the spine, or dystocia. Other conditions that are less common but occur more often in Boxers than other breeds are hystiocytic ulcerative colitis (sometimes called Boxer colitis), an invasive E. coli infection, and indolent corneal ulcers, often called Boxer eye ulcers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Entropion</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the eyelid (usually the lower lid) folds inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes continuously rub against the cornea causing irritation. <b>Entropion</b> is usually caused by genetic factors. This is different from when an extra fold of skin on the lower eyelid causes lashes to turn in towards the eye (epiblepharon). In epiblepharons, the eyelid margin itself is in the correct position, but the extra fold of skin causes the lashes to be misdirected. <b>Entropion</b> can also create secondary pain of the eye (leading to self trauma, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage). The upper or lower eyelid can be involved, and one or both eyes may be affected. When <b>entropion</b> occurs in both eyes, {{this is known as}} [...] "bilateral entropion." [...] Repeated cases of trachoma infection may cause scarring of the inner eyelid, which may cause <b>entropion.</b> In human cases, this condition is most common to people over 60 years of age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Entropion,</b> {{found in}} about 3% of the breed, is the rolling {{in of the}} eyelids, which causes the eyelashes to irritate the eye. <b>Entropion</b> is a {{condition}} that often requires surgery to fix, but once corrected causes no future issues for the dog.|$|E
