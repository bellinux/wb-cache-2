5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations.

Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Parliament in London {{considered}} {{amendments to}} the Mental Health Act 1983, including one which would give capable people the right to refuse ECT in some circumstances. Section 58A of the Mental Health Act 2007 <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> who retain decision-making capacity the right to refuse ECT, unless their psychiatrist thinks they need it urgently.

25|$|More generally, data should {{usually be}} {{weighted}} if the sample design {{does not give}} each individual an equal chance of being selected. For instance, when households have equal selection probabilities but one person is interviewed from within each household, this <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> from large households a smaller chance of being interviewed. This can be accounted for using survey weights. Similarly, households {{with more than one}} telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample, and weights can adjust for this.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, {{which serves as a}} way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.|$|E

25|$|Social {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} be adopted by healthcare professionals {{as a means to}} manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research patient data related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E
500|$|In {{his role}} as {{professor}} for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do [...] "myths" [...] and [...] "pseudoscience". For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> false hopes. Dawkins states that [...] "there is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work." [...] In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film The Enemies of Reason, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by [...] "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".|$|E

500|$|... is a ninja {{who joins}} Team Kakashi in Part II, {{carefully}} designed by Kishimoto {{to stand out}} as Sasuke's replacement by having the two look similar. Having {{been a member of}} The Foundation since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie, even after he killed his surrogate brother Shin under Danzo's diabolical orders. He consequently <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> labels based on their status, and his label of Sasuke as a traitor provokes Naruto and Sakura into antagonizing him. After the two discover his past and warm up to him, however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which has since become his primary goal in the series. Sai's attempts to form bonds turn can be humorous as he tries giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as [...] "fatso" [...] for Choji and [...] "ugly" [...] for Sakura. He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach by calling Ino [...] "beautiful", causing Ino to fall for him. When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works, although he doesn't name any of them. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, being that he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life. In the series epilogue, Sai marries Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin. Sai's voice actor is Satoshi Hino in the [...] anime, and his English voice actor is Benjamin Diskin except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Lucien Dodge.|$|E
