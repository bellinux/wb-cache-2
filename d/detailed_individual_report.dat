40|$|Background: General {{practice}} {{training in}} Australia {{is based on}} an apprenticeship-like model where most of the learning and training occurs in the practice rather than the classroom. However, there is little systematic knowledge of registrars' clinical consultation experiences. Objective: The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the Registrars' Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) project, an ongoing cohort study of registrars in five of Australia's 17 regional training providers (RTPs), and the educational and research aims and objectives of the project. Discussion: In the ReCEnT project, registrar and practice demographics are documented. Once in each of their three general practice terms, registrars then record the patient, consultation and educational aspects of 60 consecutive office-based consultations. From these data, <b>detailed</b> <b>individual</b> feedback <b>reports</b> are produced and are used to prompt registrar reflection on their practice and training program. The collected data are also used for research into registrars' training and practice and as a resource for registrar research training...|$|R

40|$|In October 2005, an {{intensive}} three-year Laser Triggered Gas Switch (LTGS) development program was initiated {{to investigate and}} solve observed performance and reliability issues with the LTGS for ZR. The approach taken {{has been one of}} mission-focused research: to revisit and reassess the design, to establish a fundamental understanding of LTGS operation and failure modes, and to test evolving operational hypotheses. This effort is aimed toward deploying an initial switch for ZR in 2007, on supporting rolling upgrades to ZR as the technology can be developed, and to prepare with scientific understanding for the even higher voltage switches anticipated needed for future high-yield accelerators. The ZR LTGS was identified as a potential area of concern quite early, but since initial assessments performed on a simplified Switch Test Bed (STB) at 5 MV showed 300 -shot lifetimes on multiple switch builds, this component was judged acceptable. When the Z{sub 20 } engineering module was brought online in October 2003 frequent flashovers of the plastic switch envelope were observed at the increased stresses required to compensate for the programmatically increased ZR load inductance. As of October 2006, there have been 1423 Z{sub 20 } shots assessing a variety of LTGS designs. Numerous incremental and fundamental switch design modifications have been investigated. As we continue to investigate the LTGS, the basic science of plastic surface tracking, laser triggering, cascade breakdown, and optics degradation remain high-priority mission-focused research topics. Significant progress has been made and, while the switch does not yet achieve design requirements, we are on the path to develop successively better switches for rolling upgrade improvements to ZR.

40|$|Background: During {{childhood}} emotional maltreatment (CEM) {{negative attitudes}} are {{provided to the}} child (e. g., ‘‘you are worthless’’). These negative attitudes may result in emotion inhibition strategies {{in order to avoid}} thinking of memories of CEM, such as thought suppression. However, thought suppression may paradoxically enhance occurrences (i. e., intrusions) of these memories, which may occur immediately or sometime after active suppression of these memories. Objective: Until now, studies that examined suppressive coping styles in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> CEM have utilized self-report questionnaires. Therefore, it is unclear what the consequences will be of emotion inhibition styles on the intrusion of autobiographical memories in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> CEM. Method: Using a thought suppression task, this study aimed to investigate the experience of intrusions during suppression of, and when no longer instructed to actively suppress, positive and negative autobiographical memories in <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Low, Moderate, and Severe CEM compared to No Abuse (total N= 83). Results: We found no group differences during active suppression of negative and positive autobiographical memories. However, when <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Severe CEM were no longer instructed to suppress thinking about the memory, <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> No Abuse, Low CEM, or Moderate CEM reported fewer intrusions of both positive and negative autobiographical memories than <b>individuals</b> <b>reporting</b> Severe CEM.

40|$|Background: An {{increasing}} number unqualified dental practitioners in Pakistan is risking public, {{who say that}} so called doctors, are playing with patients heath and lives. Unqualified practitioners not only fail to provide relief to patients but also contributes to spread of diseases e. g. Hepatitis C because {{of the use of}} infected syringes and delay in reaching appropriate diagnosis and generating misconceptions in public regarding health issues. There is need to create public awareness about health risks incurred when people visits unqualified dental practitioners. Methods: We reported the awareness level in people of Jamshoro/Hyderabad, regarding qualified and unqualified dental practitioner and what difference does it makes in treatment outcome. A descriptive type of study survey done on the sample comprising of 3087 individuals visited dental OPDs at LUMHS Jamshoro/Hyderabad during month of Oct, 2012. An assessment questionnaire comprising twelve items related to the objective was developed and administered to survey. Data is analyzed using MS Excel application software. Findings: The questionnaire was responded by 3059 individuals. Response rate was 99. 09 %, among respondents 53 % males and 47 % females. Only 68. 7 % patients reported that they were aware of difference in qualified and unqualified dental practitioners, 56 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they ask about qualification of dental of practitioner before treatment whether he is qualified or unqualified, 43 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that qualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome, 29 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> treatment outcome more or less similar whether it qualified or unqualified, 24 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that unqualified dental practitioner’s treatment is better outcome. 66 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of socio-economic reasons, 23. 6 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because they feel more comfortable, 10. 4 % <b>individuals</b> <b>reported</b> that they like to visit unqualified dental practitioner because of unavailability of qualified dental practitioners in their areas. Conclusions: Especial awareness campaigns should be launch to ensure that the masses refrain from going to unqualified dental practitioners. We can help out concerned authorities to play their role to curb the practices of unqualified dental practitioners. Key words: awareness, un-qualified practitioners, public, outcom...|$|R
