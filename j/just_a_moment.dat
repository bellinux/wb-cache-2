25|$|Belvile, Willmore, Frederick, and Pedro {{break into}} Blunt's room {{and laugh at}} him. Blunt says that <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{before there was a}} wench in his chamber and shows them the ring Florinda gave him. Belvile recognizes the ring as the one he gave Florinda when they {{exchanged}} vows. The other men, unaware that the girl is Florinda, decide to let her out and have their way with her. They draw swords to see who has the longest. Don Pedro wins and unlocks Florinda's door.|$|E
25|$|Another {{scene in}} the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt to run around the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.|$|E
500|$|Harris {{became an}} ace on September 13 {{when he and}} Lt. James Neighbours led {{divisions}} in a dawn strike on Negros Island. Both divisions flew [...] above the bombers, Neighbors' planes positioned in front to provide close support while Harris's division covered the rear. By the time the strike force crossed over the coast of Negros, 's Air Group 8 was already engaging Japanese interceptors. Enemy aircraft came after Intrepids bombers <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Mary, {{and that}} is everything. Don't mind my talk--it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> {{irritation}} and doesn't mean anything. Kiss me--there, it's all gone now, and I am not complaining any more. What have you been getting? What's in the sack?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{the burly}} figure reappeared on the balcony.|$|R
500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with E! Online, assistant director and producer of Terminator Salvation, Bruce Franklin, {{said it was an}} isolated incident. [...] "If you are working in a very intense scene and someone takes you out of your groove ... It was the most emotional scene in the movie ... and for him to get stopped in the middle of it. He is very intensely involved in his character. He didn't walk around like that all day long. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and it passed", Franklin said.|$|E
2500|$|Takamisakari had a {{straightforward}} fighting style, rarely resorting to sidestepping {{at the initial}} charge. He favoured yotsu techniques, preferring a right-hand inside, left-hand outside grip on his opponent's mawashi (migi-yotsu), and 26 of his 41 wins between July 2007 and May 2008 were by yori-kiri, or a simple force out. [...] He was also known for his effort and technique {{at the edge of}} the ring, which often allowed him to win matches in which <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> earlier it appeared that he would be pushed out.|$|E

2500|$|As {{they are}} about to draw their swords to cut their heads in the climatic moment, a {{tremendous}} shout [...] "Shibaraku!" [...] (<b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment!)</b> can be heard loudly from behind a curtain (agemaku). The hero appears and steps out onto the hanamichi (a raised platform extending through the audience to the stage) in magnificent costume (featuring the Sanshō, the three squares symbol of the Naritaya, Ichikawa Danjūrō's acting family) and red striped makeup. Arriving at the stage, he sits on a stool (aibiki) and, in a special kind of monologue called tsurane, explains his story. It is made clear that he is capable of superhuman strength, being able to drive off some of Kiyohara's henchmen only by shouting at them with his eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{publications}} and authors have regarded Taki {{as one of}} the best female fighting game or even overall video game characters of them all for a variety of reasons. In 2003, GMR feature [...] "The GREAT Women of Gaming" [...] included Taki at fourth place, while play called her and Ivy [...] "arguably the finest females in all of 3D fighting." [...] In 2007, Rob Wright of Tom's Games chose Taki {{as one of the}} 50 greatest female characters in video games, calling her [...] "a skilled and noble warrior with a shining spirit and stunning beauty" [...] and suggesting that Zhang Ziyi should play her in then-planned live action adaptation of the Soulcalibur series (Dreamcast Magazine has previously suggested Michelle Yeoh). Patrick Toworfe of B-TEN ranked her as the gaming's ninth top female character in 2014, and WhatCulture's Joe Pring placed Taki at 23rd spot on his 2015 list of greatest female fighting game characters of all time, commenting: [...] "Ignore the ridiculously over-the-top bust size for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and you’ll realise how great a character Taki is." ...|$|E
