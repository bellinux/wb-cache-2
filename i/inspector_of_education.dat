40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the factors that influence the work satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>inspectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in the Northern Cape. This aim is achieved by firstly conducting a literature study on the nature of work satisfaction and factors responsible for inspector work satisfaction and/or work dissatisfaction. Secondly an empirical investigation is conducted on the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>inspectors</b> about factors influencing their work satisfaction. Finally, recommendations are made through which <b>inspectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> can achieve optimal work satisfaction for themselves. Findings from the literature study indicate that work context and work contents factors influence inspector work satisfaction. Work context factors mainly concern supervision and working conditions. Working conditions include aspects such as physical working conditions, leadership, interpersonal relationships, policy, participation in decision-making, salary, work safety, work security and the organizational climate. Work context factors relate to inspectors' needs for psychological growth and self-fulfilment viz., the needs for responsibility, recognition, promotion, the work itself and professional development. Findings from the empirical investigation indicate that the respondents are less satisfied in their jobs than is generally reported. Inspectors regard the satisfaction of work context factors as very important and are partly contended that these needs are satisfied. However there are numerous work context factors from which they derive relatively little work satisfaction, inter alia, working conditions with regard to some supervisory activities, participation in decision-making and strategic planning in the department <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> work security and work safety. The factors within the work context are experienced as mostly satisfying. The recommendations of this study emphasise the necessity of an effective line of communication between the Education Department and the regional office, and the Education Department should launch a penetrating investigation into the filling of vacancies at the level <b>of</b> <b>inspectors.</b> With the aim on participatory management as many as possible role-players should be involved at provincial level. With the aim of professional development of both newly appointed <b>inspectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and more experienced <b>inspectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> a professional inclusion program must be developed regarding better role and task fulfilment.
