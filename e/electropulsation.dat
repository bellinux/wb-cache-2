40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to introduce DNA into mammalian cells such as calcium phosphate and microinjection, with, however, limits (side effects, price, time consuming), (1). <b>Electropulsation,</b> a physical method based on the use of electric fields pulses has now proven to be convenient for many cell types (2). Although the molecular mechanisms of <b>electropulsation</b> are still to be elucidated, its main effect is to induce locally a permeable state of the electropulsed cell membrane. This permeabilization is only transient. As its life-time is strongly increased by decreasing the temperature, the conditions most commonly prescribed in the literature are <b>electropulsation</b> at 4 °C with a subsequent incubation of cells at 4 °C before culturing (2). Nevertheless, conflicting data on the temperature dependence of electrotransfection have been reported (2, 3, 4). In the present report, this was systematically investigated with Chinese Hamste...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells were}} pulsed by using brief intense square-wave {{electric}} field pulses. The electrical treatment induced a transient local permeabilization {{of the cell}} membrane. The growth of CHO cells after <b>electropulsation</b> in an iso-osmotic pulsing buffer with low ionic content was measured. Parallel experiments evaluated cell death {{which took place in}} the minute range after <b>electropulsation</b> (short-term death) and the cell death upon 24 h (long-term death). Short-term cell death was defined as the case of cells with membrane still permeable to Direct-blue at 15 min after <b>electropulsation.</b> It was observed only under stringent pulsing conditions where electropermeabilization of {{the two sides of the}} cell was triggered. The long-term cell death, i. e., the inability of some pulsed cells to grow was observed as soon as permeabilization had been triggered. The higher the permeabilization level of the cell population was, the higher the long-term cell death level was. The cell death was linearly related to the reciprocal of the electric field intensity, i. e., to the fraction of the membrane area electrically brought to the permeable state. From this work, it appeared that for high levels of permeabilization of a cell suspension, best cell survivals were obtained if limited alterations were triggered over a large area of the plasma membrane (single pulse with high intensity) than if a small area of the membrane was strongly altered (repetitive pulses with small intensity). The highest yield of viable permeabilized cells was achieved when using one single pulse of duration up to 1 ms...|$|E
40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{capacity}} to induce strong, sequence-specific, gene silencing in cells, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represent new potential therapeutic tools. This development requires, however, new safe and efficient in vivo siRNA delivery methods. In the present technical report, we show that electrically mediated siRNA transfer can suppress transgene expression in adult mice muscles. Using <b>electropulsation</b> for siRNA delivery opens {{the way for a}} targeted gene silencing on a broad range of tissues. Clinical applications of <b>electropulsation</b> for delivery of other classes of molecules are under trials. We reported that gene silencing was efficiently obtained in vivo in an adult mammal (mouse) with chemically synthesized siRNA after its electrical delivery. The associated gene silencing was followed on the same animal and lasted at least 11 days. Gene silencing was obtained in muscles not only on young adult mice but also on much older animals. No tissue damages were detected under our electrical conditions. Therefore, this method should provide an efficient approach for a localized delivery of siRNAs in various tissues and organ...|$|E
40|$|Nano-systems, {{often used}} in {{biomedical}} applications {{for the treatment of}} a broad category of illnesses, represent one of the nanomedicine approaches recently proposed to target specific drugs only in the region where the disease has been developed. Recently the use of this technique has been proposed with <b>electropulsation,</b> hence taking advantage of the enhanced permeabilization of the cell membrane and simultaneously control the release of the encapsulated drug by the nano-system. In this work, we focus our attention on the study of liposomes nano-systems controlled by the nanosecond pulses electric fields through a microdosimetric approach. The aim is to analyse the electric field necessary to porate a non-uniform distribution of 400 nm liposomes. The work has been carried out by randomly placing 30 liposomes between two electrodes with the application of a 10 nano-second electric field puls...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTreatment of {{recurrent}} or unresectable cutaneous and subcutaneaous tumors {{continues to be}} a major therapeutic challenge. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a palliative treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor nodules for which standard treatments (e. g. radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery) have failed or proved to be insufficient. ECT combines the <b>electropulsation</b> of tumor cells (by local application of electric pulses) and the administration of antineoplastic drugs such as cisplatin or bleomycin (either intravenous or intratumoral). The permeability of the cancer cells to these poorly permeant anti-tumor drugs is transiently increased up to a hundred-fold. ECT is thus an efficient loco-regional therapy for palliative treatment of unresectable recurrent tumor nodules with overall objective response rates of approximatively 80 - 90 % and has satisfactory cosmetic results. The next challenge for ECT is the treatment of deep-seated tumors and metastases. The joint therapy of ECT and electrotransfer of immune-stimulating genes or electro-photodynamic therapy could be a promising strategy for cancer eradication...|$|E
40|$|Smart drug {{delivery}} systems represent an interesting tool to significantly improve {{the efficiency and}} the precision {{in the treatment of}} a broad category of diseases. In this context, a {{drug delivery}} mediated by nanosecond pulsed electric fields seems a promising technique, allowing for a controlled release and uptake of drugs by the synergy between the <b>electropulsation</b> and nanocarriers with encapsulated drugs. The main concern about the use of electroporation for drug delivery applications is the difference in dimension between the liposome (nanometer range) and the cell (micrometer range). The choice of liposome dimension is not trivial. Liposomes larger than 500 nm of diameter could be recognized as pathogen agents by the immune system, while liposomes of smaller size would require external electric field of high amplitudes for the membrane electroporation that could compromise the cell viability. The aim of this work is to theoretically study the possibility of a simultaneous cell and liposomes electroporation. The numerical simulations reported the possibility to electroporate the cell and a significant percentage of liposomes with comparable values of external electric field, when a 12 nsPEF is use...|$|E
40|$|Gene electrotransfer is an {{efficient}} and reproducible nonviral gene transfer technique {{useful for the}} nonpermanent expression of therapeutic transgenes. The present study established optimal conditions for the electrotransfer of reporter genes into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from rat bone marrow by their selective adherence to tissue-culture plasticware. The electrotransfer of the lacZ reporter gene was optimized by adjusting the pulse electric field intensity, electric pulse type, <b>electropulsation</b> buffer conductivity and electroporation temperature. LacZ electrotransfection into MSCs was optimal at 1500 V cm(- 1) with pre-incubation in Spinner's minimum essential medium buffer at 22 degrees C. Under these conditions beta-galactosidase expression was achieved in 29 +/- 3 % of adherent cells 48 h post transfection. The kinetics of beta-galactosidase activity revealed maintenance of beta-galactosidase production for at least 10 days. Moreover, electroporation {{did not affect the}} MSC potential for multidifferentiation; electroporated MSCs differentiated into osteoblastic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages to the same extent as cells that were not exposed to electric pulses. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility of efficient transgene electrotransfer into MSCs while preserving cell viability and multipotency...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells in}} {{suspension}} {{were subjected to}} pulsed electric fields suitable for electrically mediated gene transfer (pulse duration longer than 1 ms). Using the chemiluminescence probe lucigenin, we showed that a generation of reactive-oxygen species (oxidative jump) was present when the cells were electropermeabilised using millisecond pulses. The oxidative jump yield was controlled by the extent of alterations allowing permeabilisation within the electrically affected cell area, but showed a saturating dependence on the pulse duration over 1 ms. Cell <b>electropulsation</b> induced reversible and irreversible alterations of the membrane assembly. The oxidative stress was only present when the membrane permeabilisation was reversible. Irreversible electrical membrane disruption inhibited the oxidative jump. The oxidative jump was not a simple feedback effect of membrane electropermeabilisation. It strongly controlled long-term cell survival. This had {{to be associated with}} the cell-damaging action of reactive-oxygen species. However, for millisecond-cumulated pulse duration, an accumulation of a large number of short pulses (microsecond) was extremely lethal for cells, while no correlation with an increased oxidative jump was found. Cell responses, such as the production of free radicals, were present during electropermeabilisation of living cells and controlled partially the long-term behaviour of the pulsed cell...|$|E
40|$|The RNA interference-mediated gene {{silencing}} approach is promising for therapies {{based on the}} targeted inhibition of disease-relevant genes. Electropermeabilization {{is one of the}} nonviral methods successfully used to transfer siRNA into living cells in vitro and in vivo. Although this approach is effective in the field of {{gene silencing}} by RNA interference, very {{little is known about the}} basic processes supporting siRNA transfer. In this study, we investigated, by direct visualization at the single-cell level, the delivery of Alexa Fluor 546 -labeled siRNA into murine melanoma cells stably expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a target gene. The electrotransfer of siRNA was quantified by time lapse fluorescence microscopy and was correlated with the silencing of egfp expression. A direct transfer into the cell cytoplasm of the negatively charged siRNA was observed across the plasma membrane exclusively on the side facing the cathode. When added after <b>electropulsation,</b> the siRNA was inefficient for gene silencing because it did not penetrate the cells. Therefore, we report that an electric field acts on both the permeabilization of the cell plasma membrane and on the electrophoretic drag of the negatively charged siRNA molecules from the bulk phase into the cytoplasm. The transfer kinetics of siRNA are compatible with the creation of nanopores, which are described with the technique of synthetic nanopores. The mechanism involved was clearly specific for the physico-chemical properties of the electrotransferred molecule and was different from that observed with small molecules or plasmid DNA...|$|E
40|$|International audienceElectropulsation {{increases}} membrane permeability for ions and molecules, including DNA or low-permeant cytotoxic drugs. This {{mechanism is}} exploited in Electrochemotherapy (ETC), a treatment that consists in exposing cutaneous or subcutaneous tumors to electric pulses {{in order to}} enhance delivery of chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin or cisplatin into cancer cells. ECT is currently disseminated in more than 130 cancer centers in Europe and notably applied to the treatment of cutaneous metastases and of tumors located in complex anatomic sites such as head and neck. However, the full development of this therapeutic approach requires proper understanding of electric field impact on biological tissues. While in vitro studies performed on isolated cells provide useful information on how field pulses induce biological membrane permeabilization, more realistic 3 D in vitro models are required to mimic the behavior of cells in a tumor or a tissue. 3 D models {{can be used as a}} convenient approach for optimization of <b>electropulsation</b> protocols, offering a partial alternative to in vivo studies performed on sacrified animals. We present different microfluidic platforms allowing dielectrophoresisassisted formation of cell aggregates of regular size and shape. When specific experimental conditions are met (medium composition, electric field intensity and frequency), negative dielectrophoresis (DEP) allows efficient concentration of cells towards electric field minima and subsequent aggregation. This bottom-up assembly strategy offers several advantages with respect to the targeted application: first, DEP offers precise control of cell spatial organization, which can be adjusted by optimizing electrode design. Then, rapid establishment of cell-cell interactions is allowed thanks to dipoledipole attraction forces between neighboring cells. Lastly, the electrodes used for DEP can also be subsequently used to perform cell aggregate electroporation or characterization by electrorotation or impedance spectroscopy. Three different electrode configurations will be presented. The first one is composed of a planar quadrupolar electrode array fabricated by selectively coating a bipolar electrode array with a thin micropatterned membrane playing the role of an insulating layer. The second aims at further exploiting 3 D effects by using thick electrodes made of carbon-doped PDMS. The last one is based on an original approach developed at EPFL, known as “liquid electrodes”. This configuration exploits planar electrodes fabricated on the bottom of deadend chambers placed on each side of a microfluidic channel and acting similarly to thick electrodes embedded in the channel walls...|$|E
40|$|Electroporation {{based on}} {{microfluidic}} technique has demonstrated to be widely used for genomics and proteomics study. Exogenous molecules {{can be delivered}} into cells by transiently permeabilizing cell membrane. On the other hand, by permanently disrupting cell membrane, electroporation {{could also be used}} for extracting cell contents for analysis. In this thesis, I explored using novel microfluidic devices for both gene delivery and cellular analysis. ^ One important advantage of our flow-through electroporation technique is that the sequence of the electric field variations (equivalent to the pulse pattern in <b>electropulsation)</b> can be conveniently adjusted by altering the geometry of the channel. To improve the transfection efficiency, the effects of the low field in the wide sections on transfection has been systematically investigated by varying the residence time (0. 18 s~ 3. 22 s) and field intensity (27 V/cm~ 160 V/cm) in wide sections. Besides dc electroporation, the use of continuous 10 - 10 k Hz ac field (based on either sine waves or square waves) has also been explored for electroporation. The results reveal that electropermeabilization becomes weaker with increased frequency. In contrast, transfection efficiency reaches its maximum (~ 71 %) at medium frequencies. It is postulated that the relationship between the transfection efficiency and the ac frequency is determined by electrophoretic movement of DNA in the ac field and variation of transfection under different electropermeabilization intensities. A droplet-based electroporation method has also been demonstrated for gene delivery. Cells are encapsulated into aqueous droplets and then electroporated when the cell-containing droplets flow through a pair of microelectrodes with a constant voltage established in between. The parameters and characteristics of the electroporation have been investigated. The delivering of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid into CHO cells has been deomonstrated. We envision the application of this technique to high throughput functional genomics studies. ^ Conventional biochemical analysis mainly focused on the expression level of cellular proteins from entire cells. However, it has been increasingly acknowledged that the subcellular location of proteins often carries important information. Here, microfluidic flow-through electroporation has been applied to breach cell membranes and extract cytosolic proteins selectively in a single step. This approach has been demonstrated to allow monitoring the translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus upon stimulation without subcellular fractionation. In order to extend the selective extraction of protein method to cells in adherent status, we also do the electroporation extraction to the cells cultured on the microfluidic channel. Laser induced fluorescence detection method has been used to quantify the amount of released proteins. Integrating both the electroporation and detection steps on one chip facilitates high throughput operation and detection Our method has been demonstrated effectively in detect the difference of the protein release resulted from different subcellular location, which has been also applied to detect the translocation of NF-κB upon stimulation. ^ Besides gene delivery and proteomics study, to illustrate microfluidic device as diagnostic tool, the rapid lysis of erythrocytes by hydrodynamic focus in microfluidic channel has been conducted to study the biomechanics. Our method has been demonstrated to effectively detect the erythrocytes with different rigidities and thus be promising in application of disease diagnosis involving erythrocyte rigidity. ...|$|E
