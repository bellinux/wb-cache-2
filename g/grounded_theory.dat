40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a multi-agent model for large crowd simulations {{that addresses the}} need for socially plausible coordination behavior. A computational model for multi-agent coordination informed by well-established common <b>ground</b> <b>theory</b> is proposed. We introduce the idea of macro- and micro-coordination strategies that allow agent-based simulations to adapt to different domains. Our agent model allows the selection of appropriate behaviors based on the spatiotemporal conditions of the agent-group’s environment. By showing that different micro-coordination strategies of individual groups {{has an influence on}} the overall distribution of a crowd, we demonstrate the importance of incorporating such models into multi-agent simulations of large crowd behaviors.

It is proposed that <b>theory</b> <b>grounded</b> AI systems should be patterned after the psychological developmental stages that infants and young children go through in acquiring naïve theories. Systematicity and productivity are properties of certain representational systems indicating the range of representations the systems can form.

5000|$|Since their {{original}} publication in 1967, Glaser and Strauss have disagreed {{on how to}} apply the <b>grounded</b> <b>theory</b> method, resulting in a split between Straussian and Glaserian paradigms.

Thereafter Strauss, together with Juliet Corbin, published Basics of Qualitative Research: <b>Grounded</b> <b>Theory</b> Procedures and Techniques in 1990. This {{was followed by a}} rebuke by Glaser (1992) who set out, chapter by chapter, to highlight the differences in what he argued was original <b>grounded</b> <b>theory</b> and why, according to Glaser, what Strauss and Corbin had written was not <b>grounded</b> <b>theory</b> in its [...] "intended form" [...] but was rather a form of qualitative data analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to present and test a theory of 2 ̆ 2 safe ground, 2 ̆ 2 which details the characteristics of parent-child interaction that lead to self-esteem and behavioral competence with {{a greater degree of}} specificity than existing <b>theories.</b> Safe <b>Ground</b> <b>Theory</b> details particular characteristics of parental responses to three different contexts of child behavior: positive child behavior, controllable negative child behavior, and mitigated negative child behavior (mistakes, accidents, or otherwise blame-mitigated behavior). Parental response characteristics are considered desirable {{within the framework of the}} theory if they are predicted to develop a sense of a metaphorical 2 ̆ 2 safe ground, 2 ̆ 2 and therefore to positively influence self-esteem and behavioral competence. 2 ̆ 2 Safe ground 2 ̆ 2 connotes a place free from harm, in which one can enjoy a secure well-being. To move away from the geographical metaphor and apply it directly to the issue at hand, it is the child 2 ̆ 7 s perception that certain types of parent-child interactions, namely positive ones, can be relied upon and elicited at will. To test the theory, a retrospective study was conducted with college students (participants were asked to recall their mothers 2 ̆ 7 behavior while they were in high school), and a new set of measures (the 2 ̆ 2 Safe Ground 2 ̆ 2 Scales,) which allows measurement of 12 independent variables relevant to safe <b>ground</b> <b>theory)</b> were introduced. On the whole, safe <b>ground</b> <b>theory</b> provided a better explanation for the influences of perceived maternal responses on outcome variables (self-esteem and behavioral competence) within the context of positive child behaviors than within the context of controllable negative or mitigated negative child behaviors. Metaphorically speaking, safe <b>ground</b> <b>theory</b> described interactions leading to safe ground per se better than it described those interactions that serve to either erode safe ground or to define its boundaries. ...|$|R
