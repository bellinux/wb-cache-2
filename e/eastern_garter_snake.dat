Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association.

2500|$|Because of {{its small}} size and {{localized}} distribution around streams, the {{northern two-lined salamander}} is preyed upon {{by a variety of}} animals. Predators include birds, such as the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), snakes such as the <b>eastern</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis) and ringneck snakes (Diadophis punctatus). Other important predators of the northern two-lined salamander larvae are other salamanders, such as the large, stream-dwelling larvae of the northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) and the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). Response to a predator is variable in E. bislineata [...] Some individuals, when confronted with a <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> will remain motionless when contacted by the head of the snake, but would engage in a protean flip, where the tail is held over the body when contacted by the snake's tongue. Tail autotomy is common in E. bislineata , {{as a result of a}} struggle with a predator. Losing part of the tail increases the likelihood of surviving the encounter with a predator. In some populations, up to 32% of animals had autotomized tails.|$|R
50|$|<b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are present}} {{throughout}} most of North America. They have a wide distribution due to their varied diets and adaptability to different habitats, with varying proximity to water; however, {{in the western part}} of North America, these snakes are more aquatic than in the <b>eastern</b> portion. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> populate a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, fields, grasslands, and lawns. They almost exclusively inhabit areas with some form of water, often an adjacent wetland, stream, or pond. This reflects the fact that amphibians are a large part of their diet.|$|R
50|$|Formerly, two {{subspecies}} of the Plains <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> {{were widely}} recognized, but most authorities have since dropped subspecies recognition.

However, the distinction between the two is weak, partly {{based on the number of}} scales and partly on slight coloration differences, with T. r. haydeni said to have cleaner markings and more ventral and neck scales. As the two subspecies share the same habitat in many regions of the United States, further complicated by their strikingly similar appearance, many now do not recognize the two subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|The Greenbelt {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse places in New York City. It is home to several species of amphibians; such as the eastern redback salamander, the green frog, the American bullfrog, and the grey tree frog; reptiles; such as the <b>eastern</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the eastern box turtle, and the {{northern}} water snake, as well as New York's state reptile, the common snapping turtle. On occasion northern [...] "black" [...] racer and eastern milksnakes are reported here. Both species are threatened elsewhere on Staten Island due to habitat destruction due to development. The Greenbelt provides year-round habitat native mammals like the gray squirrel, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the white-tailed deer. Permanent bird residents include the blue jay, northern cardinal, downy woodpecker, and black-capped chickadee, while northern flickers and other migrants use the Greenbelt as a stopover on seasonal migration routes. Raptors such as Cooper's hawks, redtail hawks, and great horned owls also call the greenbelt home. The waterways are rich in fish life, and such species found here include the largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, brown bullhead, black crappie, yellow perch, chain pickerel, as well as several darter species.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen <b>eastern</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{were each}} {{kept in a}} {{terrarium}} for 10 to 15 days inside a solenoid made of electrical wire and attached to a DC power source. When activated, the solenoid reduced the intensity and reversed {{the direction of the}} ambient magnetic field inside the aquarium. Food was placed in an L-shaped corridor attached to the aquarium before the solenoid was turned on. The time between activation of the solenoid and the first strike at the food was measured. Snakes that were exposed to the magnetic cue learned to associate it with the presence of food and were able to find the food faster than the control snakes. This suggested that T. sirtalis senses magnetic fields, although the mechanism used is unknown. Following the original observation, a 6 -coil magnetic field generator calibrated to the ambient geomagnetic field was constructed. It created an area of near-zero magnetic intensity within an eight-foot diameter arena. Sixty snakes were each placed {{in the center of the}} arena for 30 trials before the coils were turned on to observe the compass bearing they took as they moved to the arena perimeter. I also recorded which way they turned upon reaching the perimeter. The same snakes were observed for 15 trials after the coils were activated and magnetic cues were eliminated in the arena. Snakes displaced 1. 55 – 1. 7 km from home ranges changed from southwest headings to random directional choice when the null-field was in place (X 2 = 194. 49; CV = 14. 067; N = 1350). The tendency to turn counter-clockwise at the arena perimeter dropped from 92 % to 52 % and from 92 % to 49 % when the null-field was on in two separate sets of experiments. The reason for a magnetic bias in turning direction is unclear, but may have to do with maintaining a constant bearing that would lead a snake back to a primary shelter in a loop. The results of the second and third sets of experiments, involving 2700 trials, suggest that geomagnetism can be used by <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> for navigation locally and over relatively long distances. ...|$|R
