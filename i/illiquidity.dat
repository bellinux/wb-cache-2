5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market <b>illiquidity.</b> Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market <b>illiquidity</b> and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E

50|$|As kyat was {{indispensable}} for everyday transactions {{for the people}} in Myanmar, there was a steady demand for it even before the crises. With the crises making kyat-denominated bank deposits overly risky and virtually worthless (due to frozen accounts and <b>illiquidity</b> of the banks) the demand for the kyat increased and supply of kyat decreased. The kyat inevitably increased in price as it became scarcer. Economist Elliot Turner also notes that this scarcity of kyat was indicative of systemic <b>illiquidity</b> in the entire system due to the banking crises.|$|E
5000|$|The {{literature}} proposes {{an important}} distinction between <b>illiquidity</b> and insolvency. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is [...] "in default because of illiquidity". In this concept the default can be solved {{as soon as the}} assets which are [...] "only temporarily illiquid" [...] become liquid (again), which makes <b>illiquidity</b> a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.|$|E

50|$|The {{premise of}} the {{strategy}} is that the convertible is sometimes priced inefficiently relative to the underlying stock, for reasons that range from <b>illiquidity</b> to market psychology. In particular, the equity option embedded in the convertible bond may {{be a source of}} cheap volatility, which convertible arbitrageurs can then exploit.|$|E
50|$|Central banks provide {{loans to}} help the system cope with {{liquidity}} concerns, where banks are {{unable or unwilling to}} provide loans to businesses or individuals. Lending into <b>illiquidity,</b> but not insolvency, was articulated at least as early as 1873, in Lombard Street, A Description of the Money Market, by Walter Bagehot.|$|E
50|$|Balance sheet {{insolvency}} is seen {{as another}} {{possible explanation for the}} banking panic. However, data shows that most bank failures due to balance sheet insolvency happened between the panics between 1930-1933 while most bank failures due to <b>illiquidity</b> happened during the actual bank panics. Illiquidty shocks were observed by measuring increased hoarding.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{inherent}} {{structure of the}} banking system, banks transform maturity from liquid deposits to illiquid assets, which creates vulnerability to bank runs. Even in situations where banks might be solvent, {{in the short run}} bank runs create an <b>illiquidity</b> problem, where banks would need to borrow funds to meet the temporary deposit withdrawals. However, under this situation, it might be harder to obtain foreign funds, as foreign creditors may also panic depending on the degree of commitment to repay international debts. Moreover, the higher the level of short term debt the higher the exposure to <b>illiquidity</b> problems. This models is particularly related to the situation in emerging markets, because of the larger role of banks compared to other financial institutions in these economies and because it is more difficult for them to get emergency funds from world markets during crisis periods.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the causes}} of the {{depression}} that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable usury laws, which would discourage risky loans, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and central banks taking risks, securitization of mortgages, <b>illiquidity</b> and insolvency of the banking system, the housing bubble, blindness to warning signs of a crisis, and the preconceptions of ideology.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the fight}} to keep the bank open {{ultimately}} failed as the existing shareholders could not put up the minimum capital required to continue the bank. Urban Bank and Urbancorp Development Bank were ordered closed under Section 30(a) of Republic Act No. 7653, the New Central Bank Act. In the 52-year history of the Bangko Sentral (under both the old and New Central Bank Acts), Urban Bank and Urbancorp Development Bank were the only banks, according to Urban Bank, ever ordered closed for reasons of <b>illiquidity.</b> UBI {{remains one of the}} largest, if not the largest, bank in Philippine banking history to have been ordered closed. However, UBI asserts that the BSP [...] "even risked perjury before the Ombudsman to conceal this fact", {{that it was one of}} the biggest, if not the biggest, banks ever ordered closed for mere <b>illiquidity</b> and that, according to Urban Bank, was a very stable bank with a very good (or excellent) track record.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the {{definition}} of the risk profile will be increased by the realization of an all-risks mapping, including both the risks identified as part of pillar 1 of the reform Solvency II - underwriting risk, market risk, counterparty default risk, operational risk, intangible asset risk - but also other risks specific to each insurer - <b>illiquidity</b> risk, business risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, etc..|$|E
50|$|On 4 November 2015, {{the company}} filed for {{insolvency}} due to <b>illiquidity</b> and on 4 February 2016 insolvency proceedings were initiated {{and the company}} placed under its own administration. On 25 May 2016 the creditors agreed an insolvency plan, requested by the Court, an on 23 September 2016 insolvency proceedings were officially terminated. Since then the company is debt-free and regained full legal capacity.|$|E
50|$|A common {{method for}} {{estimating}} the upper bound for a security <b>illiquidity</b> discount is {{by using a}} Lookback option, where the premia {{is equal to the}} difference between the maximum value of a security during a restricted trading period and its value {{at the end of the}} period. When the method is extended for corporate debt it is shown that liquidity risk increases with a bond credit risk.|$|E
50|$|After {{considering}} these authorities, {{the court}} held that provisional sentence could not be granted on a surety bond which, while limiting the surety's liability to a prescribed maximum, covered a principal indebtedness in an indefinite amount, without even acknowledging that any at all existed. No subsequent certificate, as provided for in the bond, indicating the amount of the indebtedness, could cure the intrinsic <b>illiquidity</b> of such a document.|$|E
50|$|InPhonic {{attributed}} its bankruptcy filing, in part, to {{a recent}} default under a prepetition credit agreement, as well as <b>illiquidity</b> and declining revenues caused by unprofitable marketing activities and an inability to maintain adequate inventory {{of the most popular}} wireless devices. InPhonic’s top creditor list reads like a who’s who of the nation’s top technology companies. MSN, Yahoo!, Google, America Online and Verizon all rank among the debtor’s top ten creditors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Illiquidity</b> {{coupled with}} a {{contagion}} of fear {{is seen as the}} major factor in precipitating the financial crisis. A contagion of fear led to higher short-term demand for currency and further strained the liquidity of banks and as a result made them cash flow insolvent. The contagion also led banks to dump their earning assets to build up their reserves which led to the failure of some banks otherwise solvent.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} effect of sudden stops and third generation crises in emerging markets {{are related to}} financial institutions and sudden stops in short term capital inflows, in comparison to previous crises where the main features were related to fiscal imbalances or weakness in real activity. In this type of model, international financial markets play a key role, where small open economies face a problem of international <b>illiquidity</b> during the crisis episodes, associated {{with the collapse of}} the financial system.|$|E
50|$|Maturity {{mismatching}} occurs when, for example, a bank's liabilities come due in 30 days, but the bank's assets {{will not}} mature for 1 year. Bank notes and deposit moneys commonly have 30-day suspension clauses, allowing {{the bank to}} delay payment for 30 days. A bank that issues its money in exchange for short-term assets that are payable in 30 days will thus match the maturities of its notes (30 days) to those of its assets, and it will avoid <b>illiquidity</b> and possible insolvency.|$|E
50|$|The {{complexity}} of many mortgage-backed securitization structures has heightened the overall risk aversion of investors, resulting {{in what has}} become a broader <b>illiquidity</b> in global credit markets. These disruptions have led to a precipitous decline in sub-prime lending, a significant reduction in the availability of Alt-A loans, and higher interest rates on jumbo loans (see Chart 3). The tightening in mortgage credit has placed further downward pressure on home sales and home prices, a situation that now could derail the U.S. economic expansion.|$|E
50|$|While Urban Bank {{was closed}} {{on the basis of}} <b>illiquidity,</b> its {{officers}} were accused of having a hand in the closure, through accusations from the BSP and the PDIC against thirteen Urban Bank officers and employees, including Teodoro Borlongan. With the BSP and the PDIC acting as complainants, they filed a total of five criminal complaints before the Philippine Department of Justice, from June 26 until November 15, 2000. Four of the complaints were for alleged estafa while two were related to economic sabotage. All charges were filed after the closure of Urban Bank.|$|E
5000|$|Model risk {{does not}} only exist for complex {{financial}} contracts. Frey (2000) presents {{a study of}} how market <b>illiquidity</b> {{is a source of}} model risk. He writes [...] "Understanding the robustness of models used for hedging and risk-management purposes with respect to the assumption of perfectly liquid markets is therefore an important issue in the analysis of model risk in general."Convertible bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and high-yield bonds can often be illiquid and difficult to value. Hedge funds that trade these securities can be exposed to model risk when calculating monthly NAV for its investors.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, global macro traders and {{managers}} {{focus primarily on}} the risk side of trading. For macro traders and managers, the primary element in decision-making is risk, because when investing in such a speculative world {{there are so many}} risk factors and moving data points that they must take into account. Macro traders are not fundamentalists; they rely on risk management and staying liquid to avoid a liquidity crisis. In 2007 and 2008, with the credit bubble where there was a long period of low volatility and <b>illiquidity,</b> many global macro funds found themselves with liquidity problems.|$|E
50|$|Restricted {{stock is}} {{generally}} {{incorporated into the}} equity valuation of a company by counting the restricted stock awards as shares that are issued and outstanding. This approach {{does not reflect the}} fact that restricted stock has a lower value than unrestricted stock due to the vesting conditions attached to it, and therefore the market capitalization of a company with restricted stock outstanding may be overstated. However, restricted stock has less of an impact than stock options in this regard, as the number of shares awarded tends to be lower and the discount for <b>illiquidity</b> tends to be smaller.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ship was}} built in 2000 by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique in Saint-Nazaire, the sixth ship of the {{comprehensive}} eight ships [...] "R-Class" [...] for Renaissance Cruises shipping company and was named R Six. The ship was sold in early 2001 to the Cruise Company Invest. Due to <b>illiquidity</b> turned Renaissance Cruises end of September 2001 the operation and the R Six was launched mid-2003. She was then chartered to the cruise line Pullmantur Cruises and use of this under the marketing name for Blue Star Cruises (but not yet officially renamed). Since July 2005, the ship was called the Blue Dream.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} capital {{outflows}} can have particularly destabilising consequences for emerging markets. Unlike {{the banks of}} advanced economies, which typically {{have a number of}} potential investors in the world capital markets, informational frictions imply that investors in emerging markets are ‘fair weather friends’. Thus self - fulfilling panics akin to those observed during a bank run, are much more likely for these economies. Moreover, policy distortions in these countries work to magnify the effects of adverse shocks. Given the limited access of emerging markets to world capital markets, <b>illiquidity</b> resulting from contemporaneous loss of domestic and foreign investor confidence is nearly sufficient to cause a financial and currency crises, the 1997 Asian financial crisis being one example.|$|E
50|$|There {{may not be}} a {{sufficient}} amount of participants to issue and invest in this type of security. The market has not developed in part because there are few incentives {{to be the first to}} move. Being one of the initiators in this type of market implies taking risks and undergoing a learning process that many agents are not incentivized to do. Also, more countries need to issue these types of securities so that investors are able to diversify. Given these facts, there is scope for public intervention. For example, an initiative from multilateral institutions could play the role of first mover and coordinate issuances of GDP-linked bonds from different countries. There may, thus, be a discount reflecting <b>illiquidity.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{processing}} fees, many businesses resorted to using direct debit, {{which is then}} called electronic direct debit (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren, abbr. ELV). The point-of-sale terminal reads the bank sort code and account number from the card but instead of handling the transaction through the Girocard network it simply prints a form, which the customer signs to authorise the debit note. However, this method also avoids any verification or payment guarantee provided by the network. Further, customers can return debit notes by notifying their bank without giving a reason. This means that the beneficiary bears the risk of fraud and <b>illiquidity.</b> Some business mitigate the risk by consulting a proprietary blacklist or by switching to Girocard for higher transaction amounts.|$|E
