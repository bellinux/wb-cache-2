The model integrates the gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> into a single sequential Monte Carlo simulation.

The Monte Carlo model calculates reliability indices such as loss of load probability and expected energy unserved for the combined gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network.</b> The intention of this tool is to facilitate reliability analysis of integrated energy systems. Applications of this tool are demonstrated through a case study that quantifies the impact on the reliability of the GB gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> given uncertainties such as wind variability, gas supply availability and outages to energy infrastructure assets.

30|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on the coordinated planning and operation of the integrated <b>electricity</b> and gas <b>network.</b> A multi-objective optimization for combined gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> expansion planning was presented in [9]. The objectives were to minimize both investment cost and production cost of the combined system while taking into account the N- 1 network security criterion. The coordinated scheduling of <b>electricity</b> and gas <b>network</b> was described as a bi-level programming formulation in [10]. The objective of the upper-level problem is to minimize the operating cost of <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> while the scheduling optimization problem of gas network is embedded within the lower-level problem. In [11], an interval optimization based operating strategy for gas-electricity integrated energy systems was proposed considering demand response and wind uncertainty. In most of the previous research, only the gas-fired generator has been considered as the linkage between the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> and gas network. Reference [12] proposed the model of an integrated energy system (IES) with <b>electricity</b> <b>network,</b> gas network, and district heating and cooling units (DHCs) embedded, in which both the gas-fired generators and DHCs are regarded as the interconnections of the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> and gas network. Then a coordinate scheduling strategy was utilized to optimize conflicting benefits of the two networks. The simulation results verified that the coordinate scheduling strategy can obtain better solutions of the power generation cost and gas supply cost compared with the single objective optimization method.|$|R
