50|$|In the 1560s Flanders {{suffered}} from the Beeldenstorm, the iconoclastic fury that reached its peak in 1566. During the period of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds {{as part of the}} Protestant Reformation. Frans Floris who was at the time the leading Flemish history painter never recovered from the shock of seeing his artworks destroyed. Floris found himself in a downward spiral in both his personal and professional affairs. As Floris virtually stopped painting after 1566, a younger generation of artists seized the opportunity to take over <b>his</b> important <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> painting <b>in</b> the Habsburg Netherlands.

40|$|As France {{moved from}} the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, it found itself {{in the grip of}} anglomanie â a fascination with new English ideas in the domains of science and philosophy. Chief among the English thinkers it enthusiastically embraced was John Locke. On his visits to France and in his {{personal}} correspondence, Locke interacted with prominent French thinkers, scientists and savants of the day, such as Charles Barbeyrac and Pierre Magnol, and his works engaged in a critical dialogue with those of Descartes. However, Locke has been fÃªted {{to such an extent that}} <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the <b>history</b> of ideas <b>in</b> France is often overlooked. In Locke in France 1688 - 1734, Ross Hutchison re-examines and re-contextualises the precise nature and extent of Lockeâs influence in France by exploring how his ideas were incorporated into contemporary French debates and controversies in the transitional period from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century. Hutchison highlights the various channels of dissemination which brought Locke to the attention of the French, including translations of his major works and his personal friendships with French Protestant exiles. Hutchison also presents case studies of interactions in which Lockean ideas played a dominant role in the evolution of French thought, ranging from political theory to the nature of language, theories of education, and the relation between soul and matter.

50|$|Koch {{walked on}} to the Nebraska {{football}} team, where he played punter, and later would receive a scholarship {{before the start of}} the 2004 season. He did not see game action as a redshirt freshman in 2002, but served as the backup punter. As a sophomore in 2003, he backed up Kyle Larson at punter, but did not attempt a punt. Koch was Nebraska’s punter from 2004-05 after holding kickoff duties for 7 games in 2003. He was named to the 2005 2nd-team Academic All-Big 12 squad and the 2005 Big 12 Commissioner’s Spring and Fall Academic Honor Roll. He racked up a career-punting average of 44.1 yards (with 56 kicks inside the 20 and a long of 84 yards). As a senior, Koch put together the best campaign ever at <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> school <b>history,</b> as he broke the single-season punting average mark with a 46.5-yard average in 2005. The 2005 average bested the previous record of 45.1 yards per punt by former Bengals P Kyle Larson in 2003. Koch’s average ranked 2nd nationally and helped Nebraska to a No. 2 national ranking in net punting (39.9 avg.) As a senior, was a semifinalist for the Ray Guy Award. In his collegiate finale in the 2005 Alamo Bowl (12/28), Koch posted a 51.5-yard average on 8 punts against Michigan, including 5 punts over 50 yards each. He connected on at least 1 punt of 50 yards or more in 8 of 11 contests and surpassed the 48-yard barrier in every single game. He was the Huskers’ kickoff specialist for the 2nd half of the season and 18 of his 32 kickoffs resulted in touchbacks. In his final 6 games, opponents had just 10 returns totaling 165 yards. In December 2005 he earned a degree in business administration.|$|R
40|$|Despite <b>his</b> {{prominent}} <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the <b>history</b> of Soviet music, Aram Il’ich Khachaturian {{remains a}} neglected figure in Western scholarship. There {{are a number}} of reasons for this state of affairs (one such being the prevailing view, originating from ideologically dubious Soviet publications, that the composer aimed to write in a style designed to appease the authorities), and these have resulted in a general lack of academic interest in Khachaturian’s music. Nevertheless, an examination of many of the works reveals that the composer’s musical language is distinctive and meticulously organised, and consequently merits extensive reappraisal. This thesis offers the first detailed analytical assessment of Khachaturian’s symphonic and concertante works (three symphonies, three concertos, and three concerto-rhapsodies), which stand among the composer’s most important contributions to the Soviet musical canon. These substantial investigations consider issues of formal, harmonic, and motivic construction, and follow the chronological progression of such musical parameters as a means of drawing conclusions of Khachaturian’s changing perception of symphonic and concertante composition. In order to provide a framework for these extensive analyses, Khachaturian’s contemporary standing is assessed in the first chapter, and the composer’s works are contextualised within the history of their genres in the second...|$|R
40|$|Henry Purcell {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} as one of England’s greatest composers. Little is known about his life beyond his official appointments and their duties, but as a musician he excelled as a servant of the Court, the Church and the theatre, writing odes, welcome songs, sonatas, anthems, service music and incidental music, {{and a series of}} operatic extravaganzas which fascinated the public during the 1690 s. The Purcell Companion opens with four background chapters - by Andrew Pinnock, Jonathan Wainwright, Graham Dixon and Michael Burden - on <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> British musical <b>history,</b> on music <b>in</b> London during his lifetime, on his Italian connections and on his contemporaries. In the section on the music, Eric Van Tassel presents a new view of the church music, Bruce Wood re-assesses the odes, and Peter Holman writes perceptively about the instrumental music. On the theatre works, Edward Langhans considers their context, while Roger Savage studies the music for the operas and plays. Finally Andrew Parrott deals with aspects of performance, and the volume closes with a revision of Savage’s classic essay on producing Purcell’s ever-popular opera Dido and Aeneas. A bibliography details research undertaken on various aspects of Purcell’s life and career...|$|R
40|$|The new, {{strengthened}} political conviction {{to prove}} himself as a useful composer for his society motivated the composer Hans Werner Henze, born in 1926. He had an urgent longing for change, starting, therefore, his intense involvement directly with political undertakings in 1966. The leading musical aesthetic, “musica impura”, offered him the basis for which to conceptualize a new sort of music. Freed from {{the form of the}} traditional opera, Henze created a new form of stage art. This remains not only as an important achievement in his process of improving his art in the first ten years after his politicization, but it is, at the same time, the central result of his experimental intellect. Henze’s new form adhered particularly to the concept of action music, a term defining works in which political texts, action, music, and staging are all brought together by the musical composition. Through this, a series of stage compositions came in to being, particularly five works composed before 1976, whose experimental strength, work for work, has a varying intensity. The following investigation first asks what vision Henze had of his music during his intellectual development. From this, the research will look at his path to the new form from two angles: intellectual and musical. Second, it will examine the deeper question as to the original formulas and substantive understanding from which the term action music was conceptualized, and how Henze implemented these in his compositions. This work will endeavor to clarify the definitions of the terms and the characteristics of the concepts that one finds in all five of the afore-mentioned works. Further, the interest of the present research lies in the analytical investigation of the compositions, particularly within the aspect of the newer stage conception of the 1960 s and 70 s, with which Henze experimented intensively. In fact, his intellectual development paralleled his concentration on the developmental possibilities of these stage concepts. Because of this, each of the five compositions will be individually analyzed. In the end, the answer to these questions should show the meaning and importance of Hanzes artistic creation, and, further, present <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> music <b>history</b> for deeper discussion...|$|R
40|$|Imitatio et aemulatio : the Lhomme armé-tradition in {{the present}} and in the past as (inspirational) source for a renewed {{compositional}} language, renaissance of polyphony?How does a contemporary composer intercommunicate with music from the past? How can compositional ideas of the renaissance in particular polyphony influence the personal musical language? To what extent might music of a certain period serve as a source of inspiration and renewal for a contemporary composer, being very much aware of <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the <b>history</b> of western music?The Lhomme armé-Masses belong to the largest complex of polyphonic compositions based on the same melody. Within this context a number of these masses (Josquin (2), de la Rue (2), Compère) were utilized in this comparative study as case studies for the sake of their many-sidedcounterpointical treatment of this Lhomme armé-melody, the canon techniques in particular. On the other hand, analysis, interviews and profound study of secundary literature are the means of this comparative research of works of the 20 th and 21 rst century which were also inspired by and based on the same melody. Works which were opted for this comparison are the Missa Quinque super lhomme armé (Manneke,Vermeeren, DHollander, De Ley, Van Reyn, 2004), Peter Maxwell Davies Missa super Lhomme armé (1968 - 1971), Karl Jenkins The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace (1999) and Christopher Marshalls Lhomme armé:Variations (2003). The development of an artistic portfolio with five new compositions shapes the guideline for musical reflection upon this research: an oratorio, Heilige Seelenlust focusses on canontechniques; Antifona for fanfare examines the function of cantus firmus as fundamental for an entire composition; Ma fin est mon commencement tries to formulate a compositional answer on the prolationcanon of the second Agnus Dei of Josquins Missa super voces musicales; Agnus Dei for four voices and instruments emulates the proportion technique in the third Agnus Dei of the same Josquin Mass; finally, the 24 Emulations upon Lhomme armé for pianosolo are a symbiosis of all acquired insights of the previous works and stands for the final answer with regard to the question of finding an alternative model for a longer piece of music. These findings were stated on the base of articles, seminars and performances. They give concrete form to compositional answers on the (new) insights in polyphonic thinking and try to formulate on the other hand a contemporary vocal and instrumental interpretation of the research process, written down in this dissertation. status: publishe...|$|R
