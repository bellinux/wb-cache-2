Seasonal differences in pasture composition and nutritional implications. Dairyfarming Annual, Massey University: 46 - 56. This thesis {{presents the results of}} seven experiments or trials between August 1990 and November 1994 designed to study the causes and effects of the variation in nutrient content within dairy pasture in New Zealand and their impact on dairy cow lactation and reproductive performance. The work includes the results of two observational studies; a survey of seasonal variation in dairy pasture nutrients on four dairy farms; two controlled field trials of supplementation of pasture fed cows in seven commercial dairy herds (involving 1650 cows); an experiment recording changes in pasture nutrients with grazing, maturity and soil phosphate levels; and a replicated split plot trial measuring changes in pasture nutrients after nitrogen (N) application. Trials or experiments involved aspects of agronomy and pasture management, herd reproductive performance and dairy cow nutrition. A common theme of the work was examination of factors affecting the high crude protein levels present in the diets of dairy cows consuming fresh ryegrass/white clover pasture, measurement of this and testing of some practices that may affect the productive penalties caused by these high protein levels. Section 1 of the thesis deals with the initial observations (Chapter 1) and a survey of pasture nutrient changes through all seasons on four dairy farms (Chapter 2). The first chapter describes the initial observational studies over two springs (1990 and 1991) in nine commercial dairy herds and additional survey information from 35 herds (1991). There was a strong negative relationship between urea levels in blood (or milk) and milk production in three separate datasets using principal component analysis (PCA). Milk urea levels related closely to pasture protein levels and especially protein/soluble carbohydrate ratios in pasture. Herd reproductive performance was also worse in the herds with higher urea levels. For example, the four herds observed in 1990 averaged 23. 62, 24. 09, 20. 91 and 21. 88 % for pasture crude protein; 7. 38, 8. 20, 5. 85 and 6. 20 mmol/l for serum urea; and 0. 74, 0. 75, 0. 94 and 0. 91 kg milkfat/cow/day respectively over the 17 week period. "Empty" (non-pregnant) cow percentages for the herds were 10. 6 %, 4. 2 %, 1. 8 % and 3. 1 % respectively. Tentative conclusions were {{made on the basis of}} these findings relating especially to the potential negative effects of excess dietary crude protein in pasture on milk production and on herd reproductive performance. These conclusions were then explored in more depth and reported in subsequent chapters. Seasonal changes in pasture nutrients on dairy farms were measured by analysing pasture collected over two years from four dairy farms of varying soil type and climate (Chapter 2). Two of the farms were at Massey University and two in the Waikato district. All farms were of above average productivity for their district. Samples were collected every two weeks from each farm and represented pasture about to be consumed by cows on these farms. These were analysed for major nutrients or analytes (crude protein (CP), acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), soluble carbohydrates (SOLCHO), pectin, digestibility (DOMD), potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium) using near infra red spectrometry (NIRS). Highest pasture CP, DOMD, and SOLCHO levels were found in spring and autumn (ranging from 23. 6 - 25. 8 %, 75. 4 - 78. 1 % and 9 - 12 % DM respectively) with lowest ADF, NDF and pectin levels (ranging from 27 - 28 %, 36 - 38 % and 1. 8 % respectively). The converse applied to the summer period with 20 - 22 % CP, 70 - 71 % DOMD, 8 - 10 % SOLCHO, and 29 - 31 % ADF, 42 - 45 % NDF and 2 - 2. 5 % pectin. Calcium and magnesium levels were highest in summer (0. 8 % and 0. 2 % respectively compared to 0. 65 % and 0. 19 % respectively), and potassium higher in spring and winter (3. 2 %). The potential consequences for milk production from dairy cows calving seasonally are discussed, with particular reference to the imbalance in the rumen between rumen degraded protein and fermentable carbohydrates. Especially notable were the seasonal differences in protein levels and the changes in the type of carbohydrate available in late spring/summer. Soluble carbohydrate decreased, and fibre expressed as NDF and ADF increased in late spring and summer. Section 2 of the thesis deals with supplementation trials on 6 commercial dairy herds (Chapter 3) and another supplementation trial on a 7 th herd involving maize silage and concentrates (Chapter 4). Controlled supplementation trials on six commercial dairy herds (total 1380 cows) were carried out in spring 1992 to examine the reproductive and productive effects of supplementing pasture-fed cows with carbohydrates (either soluble carbohydrate or starch). Herds were split into treated and control groups on each farm to remove individual farm factors from the experiment and relatively low levels of either molasses (3 herds, 700 mls molasses/cow/day) or concentrate (3 herds, 1. 3 kg concentrate/cow/day) were fed for an extended period in spring (approximately 90 days, from 1 September to 25 November). Significant milk production and reproductive effects were measured when results were pooled for all herds. Immediate responses were approximately 0. 5 litres of milk per kg of supplement on average, but the main milk production response was observed later in the experiment (October and November) and was higher in better fed herds and those in better body condition. No effect was found on non-return rate or submission rate, but <b>empty</b> <b>cow</b> rates at the end of the mating season in the supplemented group were half those of the control groups (2. 7 % vs 5 %). These results may indicate considerable productive and reproductive advantage in supporting pasture fed cows through October/November with appropriate supplement when ryegrass is in the reproductive phase, and has reduced digestibility which is likely to limit intake of ME. Improving diet quality or ME concentration at this stage may help reduce the monthly decline from peak lactation which typically occurs at this time in most districts in New Zealand. Chapter 4 describes a controlled supplementation trial which was carried out in spring 1993 on a 240 cow commercial dairy herd where the diet was formulated according to recommended nutrient levels for high production (NRC, 1989). The diet was improved in content of "bypass" protein, soluble carbohydrate, lipid and minerals. The base diet for control and treated groups was pasture and maize silage. Both control and treated herds were offered the same amount of metabolisable energy (ME) - ie. the diets were iso-energetic. Improved milk production (2 litres milk) and reproduction (2. 7 % empty vs 6 %) occurred in response to the addition of the balancing concentrate in the treated group. There was a large carryover effect when the concentrate feeding ceased and the sole diet was pasture. Pasture dry matter assessment indicated the supplemented cows continued to consume more dry matter than control cows. The immediate response to supplementation was 1. 25 litres/kg DM of supplement, and with the carryover response added exceeded 2. 5 litres/kg DM of supplement. The immediate response improved after supplementation had continued for 2 - 3 weeks. This trial did not show substitution for pasture, but the converse. Improving the balance of dietary nutrients in pasture did improve performance. Section 3 of the thesis deals with aspects of grazing management, agronomy and the effects of application of nitrogen to pasture on the nutrients within pasture (Chapters 5 and 6). Variation in pasture nutrients from week to week was evident in the seasonal study presented in Chapter 2. More information regarding changes in pasture nutrients after grazing and as pasture matures was sought because this was considered a likely source of variation in productivity. In Chapter 5 nutrient levels in pasture were determined after grazing or in pasture left ungrazed by sampling every five days during spring from five sites located on two dairy farms. Sites were either grazed as part of normal rotation (3 sites) on the farm or were caged (2 sites) to prevent grazing. Conclusions from this study were limited by a lack of replication, but nevertheless highlighted reduced CP with maturity, increased NDF with maturity and immediately after grazing, reduced SOLCHO just after grazing and reduced digestibility with the advancement of spring into October. Pectin and calcium levels increased as spring advanced. The results were consistent with literature on the subject. The effects of the level of nitrogen fertiliser and the timing of application in spring on pasture nutrient composition were examined in the final experiment reported in Chapter 6. Nitrogen was identified from the literature as one of the main external influences likely to affect pasture protein levels. Nitrogen was applied as urea to small (2 m 2) plots at 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg N/ha and at varying times (15 August, 31 August and 14 September) in late winter/early spring to dairy pasture at the Massey University Dairy Research Unit. The trial was a replicated split plot design with levels of N randomised within starting dates. Significantly reduced ADF and NDF levels, reduced SOLCHO, reduced dry matter %, and increased CP levels occurred after N application. Higher N rates produced greater changes. Application of N earlier in winter resulted in greater effects on ADF (2 % difference vs 6 %), NDF (2 % difference vs 6 %) and CP (5 % vs 7 %) but lesser effects on SOLCHO (1. 5 % difference vs 0. 5 %) and these lasted longer in wintery conditions. Effects on SOLCHO were more marked later in the experiment. Brix values (a refractometer measurement of juice squeezed from the herbage sample) were also examined as part of this study to evaluate their usefulness as a rapid measure of SOLCHO concentration; results were inconclusive. The consequences of the effects of N on pasture for dairy cows are discussed and possible dietary or management improvements to minimise the consequences are suggested. The increased protein and reduced fermentable carbohydrate (reduced SOLCHO and reduced ADF or NDF) mean that poorer rumen fermentation could occur after N application, with lower amounts of bacterial tissue presented to the small intestine from ruminal fluid. A final summarising chapter (Chapter 7) combines the conclusions from the various studies, indicates the need for further information and discusses how this might be obtained. Studies presented in this thesis have not conclusively shown that high CP in pasture has damaging effects on productivity, but have indicated strong associations and various factors influencing pasture CP and also other pasture nutrients...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the issues pertaining to runoff ownership in Canterbury, focusing particularly on reasons for purchase, how the runoff was used, and profitability. Six case study farmers were selected and interviewed, following identification by industry key informants. Initial selection criteria were runoff ownership, and availability of comprehensive and reliable information. Final criteria included achieving diversity of situation in respect to land type and farming system. The runoffs were evaluated according to the net benefits they contributed to the overall dairying operation. Achieving greater business control was the major driver for runoff purchase. A secondary driver related to increased profitability opportunities, including both operating returns and capital gains. Farmers also enjoyed the diversity of operations and decision making challenges that runoff ownership provided. All case study farmers used their runoff for wintering purposes and supplying feed to the milking platform for lactating cows. Four farmers used the runoff for rearing their heifers, with three farmers pursuing dairy beef, carrying-over <b>empty</b> <b>cows,</b> and cash cropping activities. Three farmers also sold surplus feed on the open market. The relative amount of runoff area to milking platform area ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 98 ha (per Iha of milking platform). The value of runoff capital invested ranged from $ 1, 540 to $ 8, 645 per lactating cow (on peak numbers). These ratios were dependent on both the management activities undertaken on the runoff and the runoff's resources. Annual operating returns (EBIT) ranged between 3. 4 % and 6. 0 % for the 2004 / 05 year. These cash rates of return are comparable to returns generated through other capital appreciating assets. Capital gains ranged from 15. 5 % to 23. 9 % compounded per annum, from the year of purchase through to 2005, net of development expenditure. Currently these operating returns are less than the interest costs incurred, assuming the current market value is totally funded with debt capital. Runoff cashflow levels were found to become self-funding after a small period of time. Due to capital gains, a 4 % cash return on current market values is considerably greater when expressed across the historical purchase price (debt employed). The financial success of future runoff investments will depend strongly on market price movements for runoff-grown feed and the levels of capital gains that are achieved...|$|R

(BE, EstroginÂ®) juntamente com implante intravaginal de progesterona de 1 Âº uso (G 1 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 29; G 2 - PrimerÂ®, n= 26) e de 2 Âº uso (G 3 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 26; G 4 - PrimerÂ®, n= 24), no dia 6, 5 foi aplicado 150 mcg i. m. de Cloprostenol SÃ³dico (SincrocioÂ®), sendo a retirada do implante de P 4 no dia 8. Dia 9, ocorreu a aplicaÃ§Ã£o de 1 mg de BE i. m. e no dia 10 a tarde a IATF. O lote D 8 iniciou o protocolo de IATF no dia 25 / 11 / 2008 e foi tratado da mesma forma, Ã  exceÃ§Ã£o da aplicaÃ§Ã£o do luteolÃ­tico que ocorreu no oitavo dia. Os grupos foram formados: implante de 1 Âº uso (G 5 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 27; G 6 - PrimerÂ®, n= 28) e de 2 Âº uso (G 7 -SincrogestÂ®, n= 26; G 8 - PrimerÂ®, n= 24). Foram realizadas duas coletas de sangue (dia 0 e dia 9 do protocolo) para dosagem de progesterona plasmÃ¡tica atravÃ©s do mÃ©todo de radioimunoensaio. As taxas de prenhez dos grupos do lote D 6, 5 foram de 55, 17 %(G 1), 69, 23 %(G 2), 57, 67 %(G 3), 70, 83 %(G 4) (p= 0, 263). No lote D 8 os grupos G 5, G 6, G 7, G 8 deste lote apresentaram 44, 44 %, 67, 86 %, 46, 15 %, e 58, 33 % de prenhez (p= 0, 573). As taxas de prenhez para os lotes D 6, 5 e D 8 foram, de 62, 86 % e 54, 29 %. NÃ£o houve diferenÃ§a nas taxas de prenhez a IATF entre os lotes (p= 0, 262). O teste Qui-quadrado e o T-test foram utiizados para a anÃ¡lise estatÃ­stica dos dados. O ECC mÃ©dio dos dois lotes foi de 2, 66 (n= 210). NÃ£o houve influÃªncia do ECC sobre as taxas de prenhez a IATF (p= 0, 562). TambÃ©m nÃ£o houve diferenÃ§a estatÃ­stica na taxa de prenhez a IATF e de prenhez final dos animais conforme a idade e dias pÃ³s parto. Dezenove vacas apresentaram P 4 maior que 1 ng/ml no dia 0 (D 6, 5 = 7, com 5 vacas prenhez e 2 vazias; D 8 = 12, com 7 vacas prenhez e 5 vacas vazias) e quatro vacas do lote D 8 apresentaram P 4 maior que 1 ng/ml no dia 9 do protocolo (com 1 vaca prenhe). Os implantes da Primer Â® e SincrogestÂ® de primeiro e segundo uso foram eficientes para a sincronizaÃ§Ã£o da ovulaÃ§Ã£o das vacas com cria ao pÃ©. A antecipaÃ§Ã£o do luteolÃ­tico nÃ£o aumentou as taxas de prenhez a IATF e prenhez final. The {{objective of}} this work was to verify {{the effect of the}} anticipation of a luteolytic before the removal of the intravaginal device with progesterone (P 4) on the range of pregnancy in the artificial insemination in fixed time (TAI) of post partum cows compared to the IATF traditional protocols that use the luteolytic while removing P 4 and also verify the action and efficacy of the implants with a gram of progesterone of first and second use. 210 post partum cows beef cows of Montana breed were used with 48 - 98 days post partum. Out of these, 127 were multiparous cows and 83 were primiparous cows. The animals were divided in two lots of 105 cows, comparing 8 groups. The lot D 6, 5 was treated on the day zero (27 / 11 / 2008) with 2 mg of estradiol benzoate i. m. (BE, EstroginÂ®) together with the intravaginal implant of progesterone of first use (G 1 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 29; G 2 - PrimerÂ®, n= 26) and of second use (G 3 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 26; G 4 - PrimerÂ®, n= 24), on the day 6, 5 150 mcg i. m of Cloprostenol (SincrocioÂ®), the removal of the implant of P 4 on the day 8. On the day 9, there was an application 1 mg of BE i. m and on the day 10 the IATF. The lot D 8 (05 / 12 / 2008) was treated on the same way, except for the application of luteolitico, that occurred on the eighth day. The groups were formed this way: first use (G 5 - SincrogestÂ®, n= 27; G 6 - PrimerÂ®, n= 28) and second use (G 7 -SincrogestÂ®, n= 26; G 8 - PrimerÂ®, n= 24). Two blood sample collections were performed (Day 0 and Day 9 of protocol) for plasma progesterone dosage through the radioimunoensaio method. The ranges of pregnancy of the groups in the lot D 6, 5 were 55, 17 %(G 1), 69, 23 %(G 2), 57, 67 %(G 3), 70, 83 %(G 4) (p= 0, 263). In the lot D 8 the groups G 1, G 2, G 3, G 4 of this lot presented 44, 44 %, 67, 86 %, 46, 15 %, e 58, 33 % of pregnancy (p= 0, 573). The ranges of pregnancy for the lots D 6, 5 and D 8 were 62, 86 % e 54, 29 %. There was no difference in the ranges of pregnancy TAI between the lots (p= 0, 262). The test Qui- Quadrado and T-test was used for the statistics analysis of the data. The average body condition of the two lots was 2, 66 (n= 210). There was no influence of the body condition on the ranges od pregnancy TAI (p= 0, 562). There was no statistic difference in the range TAI and final pregnancy of the animals according to the age and post partum days. Nineteen cows presented P 4 maior que 1 ng/ml no dia 0 (D 6, 5 = 7, with 5 cows pregancy and 2 empty; D 8 = 12, with 7 cows pregnancy and 5 <b>cows</b> <b>empty)</b> and four <b>cows</b> of the lot D 8 presented P 4 maior que 1 ng/ml on the Day 9 of the protocol (with only one cow pregnant). The implants of PRIMER and SINCROGEST of first and second use were efficient for the synchronization of the ovulation of the post partum cows. The anticipation of luteolytic treatment did not increase pregnancy rates to TAI and also the final pregnancy rate...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of seasonal changes in thermal environment and pregnancy on the physiological responses of crossbred dairy cows (Butana x Friesian). Also, it was intended to examine the nycthermal changes in physiological parameters in highand low producing cows under local tropical conditions. In experiment 1, crossbred multiparous dairy cows were divided into four groups according to reproductive state (empty, early, mid and late pregnancy). The cows were exposed to a normal grazing programme under natural summer and winter conditions. The rectal temperature (Tr) and respiratory rate (RR) were significantlyhigher during summer than during at different stages of pregnancy; there was an increase in Tr and RR with the advance of pregnancy. The packedcell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin concentration (Hb) were significantly higher in summer; however, both parameters decreased in late pregnancy. The cows had higher total leukocyte count (TLC) in winter only during early pregnancy. The TLC was significantly higher in winter comparedto the respective summer value in early pregnancy. For all experimentalgroups serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and urea were significantly higher during summer than winter. Plasma glucose levels decreased with the advance of pregnancy. There was a tendency for decrease in triglyceride level with the advance of pregnancy. The urea level tended to behigher during early pregnancy in both seasons. The activity of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher, while alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was lower in empty group and late pregnancy during summer than during winter. The ALT activity increased significantly with the advance of pregnancy and the AST level was iv significantly higher during late pregnancy in both seasons. Serum calcium (Ca) level was higher in the empty group and mid pregnancy and serum phosphorus (P) level was lower in all experimental groups during summer. There was a decrease in Ca level and an increase in P level with advance of pregnancy. Serum magnesium (Mg) level was significantly higher during winter in empty and early pregnancy. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated in summer than in winter. Serum triiodothyronine (T 3) was higher in summer, and there was slight decrease with the advance of pregnancy in both seasons. Serum thyroxine (T 4) was lower in summer in all groups. Serum cortisol increased in response to summer heat load, and was higher during late pregnancy in both seasons. In experiment 2, twelve crossbred (Butana x Friesian) <b>empty</b> multiparous dairy <b>cows</b> were selected and divided into two groups (high and low producing dairy cows). The nycthermal changes in physiological parameters were monitored for 48 hours. Rectal temperature (Tr) increased in the afternoon (12 : 00 p. m.) in both groups. The high producing cows maintained higher Trvalues during the course ofthe study. Respiratory rate (RR) was increased the afternoon in both groups of cows; the high producing cows maintained higher RR values than low producing cows. Heamatocrit and Hb concentration were slightly higher in high producing cows than in low producing cows. Serum levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides showed no significant diurnal variation in both groups of cows. Serum urea concentration showed relative instability in both experimental groups. Serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and urea were lower in high producing cows than inthe low producing cows. AST and ALT showed irregular diurnal variation in the both high and low producing cows. The high v producing cows maintained slightly higher aminotransferase enzymes activity. Serum cortisol level was higher at 12 : 00 p. m and 6 : 00 p. m. compared to values monitored in the morning (6 : 00 a. m.) and night (12 : 00 p. m). The cortisol level was higher in high producing cows than in low producing cows. Serum insulin level did not reveal significant diurnal variation in both groups of cows. Highproducing cows maintained higher serum insulin level than in the low producing cows. The results indicated that under local tropical conditions when the temperature humidity index (THI) exceeds 75 during summer, dairy cows were exposed to heat stress conditions which affect thermoregulatory response, serum metabolite level and endocrine responses that could impact negatively productivity and reporoductivity performance. The stage of pregnancy had significant influence onthermoregulation, erythrocytic parameters, serum levels of Ca, P and cortisol. The nycthermal effect did not influence most of the parameters, because there was no critical change in climatic conditions during the course of the study. High milk yield influenced thermoregulation, blood constituents and endocrine responses...|$|R
