40|$|Lignocellulose {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} carbon sources in nature. This naturally-occuring substance is an underutilized source of bioenergy. A major bottleneck in biofuel processing is the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose into its ultimate <b>fermentable</b> <b>product,</b> glucose. Cellulomonas fimi is a well-studied soil organism known for its capabilities to efficiently hydrolyze cellulose. Recently sequenced genomes of Cellulomonas fimi and Cellulomonas flavigena have allowed analysis to reveal previously unidentified cellulases from several glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. This study also includes the expression of secreted cellulases from families GH 5, 6, and 9 at the protein level by the native organism after growth in media supplemented with carboxymethylcellulose or soluble xylan. In order to find enzymes with novel qualities, the cloning and expression of these newly identified cellulases from C. fimi and C. flavigena were done. One of these enzymes is Celf_ 1230 (Cel 6 C), a putative cellobiohydrolase from the glycoside hydrolase family 6. Using substituted cellulose derivatives as substrates, we have characterized Celf_ 1230 to be a thermostable enzyme with endoglucanase activity...|$|E

In this work the effect of process conditions (size distribution of the wheat straw, temperature and time) was evaluated against production of <b>fermentable</b> <b>products.</b> RESULTS: The use of milled wheat straw fractions as a raw material containing blends of different particle size distribution showed that the latter had an influence on the final sugars in the hydrolysate. Improved values of glucose (21. 1 %) and xylose yields (49. 32 %) present in the hydrolysate were obtained with treatment severity factors of 2. 77 and 3. 36, respectively. Mathematical models were developed aimed at establishing the effect of process conditions on monosaccharide concentration and its degradation in the liquor. CONCLUSION: This work shows {{that the use of}} wheat straw blends with various particle sizes has a significant effect on the extraction of <b>fermentable</b> <b>products.</b> The effect of treatment severity, which takes into account both processing time and temperature was also evaluated. These results are of importance for process design. ALBAN programm...|$|R

40|$|A Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements’ for the Degree of B. Sc. in MicrobiologyCellulolytic {{microorganisms}} such as fungi {{and bacteria}} {{are responsible for}} much of the cellulose degradation in soils. Despite this vast number of cellulase producers, there is a deficiency of microorganisms that can produce significant amount of the three cellulase enzyme specifities i. e. endoglucanases, exoglucanases and cellobiases to efficiently degrade cellulose to <b>fermentable</b> <b>products.</b> Little emphasis has been given to cellulase production from bacteria despite their extremely high natural diversity, which endows them with the capability to produce stable enzymes. Soil samples were collected from National parliament area & BRAC nursery. The soil samples were inoculated separately and from each, only a single bacterial isolate was obtained. The three isolates were screened for cellulolytic activity using Congo red stain on Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plates inoculated with the isolates. All the isolates were found to hydrolyze Carboxymethylcellulose. A Gram stain test carried out identified the three isolates as Gram-positive rods. Morphological and biochemical analysis indicated that they all associated mainly with members of the Bacillus sp. Isolates from BRAC nursery (CDB 3, CDB 4 & CDB 5) selected for further functional studies bore the two enzyme specificities of a cellulase enzyme system. A crude enzyme extract was found to hydrolyze Avicel and CMC with enzyme activities of 0. 326 ml/mg, 0. 374 ml/mg, 0. 352 mi/mg and 0. 203 ml/mg, 0. 206 ml/mg and 0. 147 ml/mg respectively. Optimum temperature for activity measured over 60 minutes was found to be 30 °C with relatively high activity at both 37 °C and 60 °C.

40|$|Milk {{is highly}} perishable, thus necessitating its {{immediate}} consumption, mostly fresh, or processing into <b>fermentable</b> <b>products</b> such as yoghurt, butter or cheese {{which may have}} improved keeping quality and nutritive value. A small-scale milk processing model at the Dairy Research Programme, National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI), Ahmadu Bello University, Shika, Zaria in Northern Nigeria was initiated in June 1993 utilizing milk produced by the dairy herd. Milk collection from smallholder dairy farmers was incorporated into the milk processing scheme to boost the quantity of milk available. Since the commencement of the milk collection programme started, the sales and expenditure records had not been analysed to assess the financial implications of the model. Therefore this study was carried out to ascertain the effects of milk product, year and season of production on the profitability of milk collection and processing. It was evident that a total income of 1, 259, 867 Naira (1 US$= 25 Naira) was realised from the combined sales of yoghurt, cheese, butter and pasteurised milk with yoghurt accounting {{for most of the}} income (1, 151, 907 Naira) and cheese the least (1, 460 Naira). When the cost of production was deducted from total income, an overall profit of 447, 202 Naira was realised over the four year-period with the highest profit obtained during the wet rainy season (June-September) and least gross margin during the dry season (February-May). Yearly differences were also significant (P< 0. 01) with 1998 producing the most profit of 235, 872 Naira. It was concluded that overall, the NAPRI milk collection and processing model was a profitable and viable venture, and since consumer preference for yoghurt was over and above that of cheese, butter and pasteurised milk, a strengthening of yoghurt production capability was suggested. Finally, as the highest gains were recorded during the wet season, an expansion of the milk collection and storage facilities to handle the extra milk should be embarked upon...|$|R
40|$|Black liquor is a {{significant}} water pollution source, and many investigations related to black liquor have been performed over the years. Recovering cotton pulping black liquor (CPBL) is difficult due to its low lignin content. This study presents corn stover pretreatments using CPBL alone and {{in combination with other}} agents to improve the cost-effectiveness of the biomass-to-sugar conversion. The results showed that 78. 4 %, 74. 9 % and 82. 1 % of the lignin was removed after pretreatment with sodium hydroxide (SHP), CPBL (CPBLP) and CPBL combined with sodium sulfite (SS-CPBLP). Accordingly, the glucose and xylose contents in the pretreated corn stover increased to more than 62 % and 24 % after CPBLP and SS-CPBLP, respectively, which was comparable to SHP. Moreover, the total sugar yield of CPBLP and SS-CPBLP was 66. 4 % and 75. 3 %, which was 2. 9 % and 11. 8 % higher than that of SHP (63. 5 %), respectively. The lignin content in the black liquor rose from 6. 9 g/L to 17. 8 g/L, and the sulfonation degree of the black liquor reached 0. 8 mmol/g after SS-CPBLP, which had a positive effect on further lignin utilization. The results indicate that the use of CPBL for corn stover pretreatment not only efficiently produced <b>fermentable</b> sugar <b>products,</b> but also presented a solution to the CPBL pollution issue. Thus, this process represents a method of waste recycling with high industrialization potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is {{traditionally}} used in northern Europe {{as a source}} of fermentable extract to beer production. In Italy during the last ten years the number of brewery and micro-brewery has grown exponentially in parallel with the interest in malt and beer production whit local raw materials. Traditionally durum wheat varieties (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) are used to pasta and bread production and few papers are present on durum wheat malting and brewing processes. This preliminary work is aimed to the development of durum wheat malt obtained from an ancient sicilian wheat variety and the study of some quality parameters for malt and wort production. The durum wheat variety “Simeto” was grown and harvested in 2015 in Sicily (Italy). The trials to produce a pale wheat malt were carried out on laboratory scale using 500 g of grains. Three consecutive cycles of steeping (16 hours) and air rest (8 hours) at 15 °C was used to obtain a 45 % of steeping degree. The grains were germinated for 5 days at 95 % of RH and 15 °C of temperature. The green malt was dried during kilning phase with initial temperature of 35 °C (8 hours) and gradually increased to 43 °C (16 hours). During the last 9. 5 hours of kilning the sample was divided in two parts to test two different final drying temperatures of 43 (SM 43) and 70 °C (SM 70). The rootlets were manually removed from the wheat malt and the samples were milled to make the chemical and physical analysis on wheat,wheat malt and congress wort derived from them. Humidity, betaglucan content betaglucanase activity, extract, colour, pH and apparent attenuation limit were determined according to Analytica EBC protocols. The main drawback during mashing with wheat malt are due to high-molecular-weight polymers (principally arabinoxylans and betaglucans). “Simeto” wheat show a betaglucan content of 0. 54 ± 0. 01 % w/w and after malting process be even lower, 0. 16 ± 0. 01 and 0. 13 ± 0. 04 % w/w, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The betaglucanase activity found on SM 43 was 165. 84 ± 4. 47 U/kg while for SM 70 was 142. 22 ± 5. 21 U/kg. These differences are probably due to the final drying temperature (70 °C) that partially inactivate betaglucanase enzymes. Extract (%) obtained from EBC congress wort show no significant difference between SM 43 and SM 70, respectively 81. 22 ± 1. 65 and 81. 68 ± 0. 87 % on d. b., in accordance with those reported in literature for typical pale wheat malt (81. 00 - 86. 00 % d. b.). The wort color found for both durum wheat malts was very pale, 3. 04 ± 0. 69 and 3. 28 ± 0. 15 EBC units, respectively for SM 43 and SM 70. The results show that “Simeto” wheat variety was suitable to pale malt production. The different temperatures used at the end of kilning phase do not significantly influence the qualitative parameters except for the betaglucanse activity. The malts production from ancient durum wheat varieties, could represent a new interesting way to further enrich the sources of <b>fermentable</b> <b>products</b> encouraging the maintenance of biodiversity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for ferric iron reduction with <b>fermentable</b> substrates, fermentation <b>products,</b> and complex organic matter as electron donors was investigated with sediments from freshwater and brackish water {{sites in the}} Potomac River Estuary. In enrichments with glucose and hematite, iron reduction was a minor pathway for electron flow, and fermentation products accumulated. The substitution of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide for hematite in glucose enrichments increased iron reduction 50 -fold because the fermentation products could also be metabolized with concomitant iron reduction. Acetate, hydrogen, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, methanol, and trimethylamine stimulated the reduction of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide in enrichments inoculated with sediments but not in uninoculated or heat-killed controls. The addition of ferric iron inhibited methane production in sediments. The degree of inhibition of methane production by various forms of ferric iron {{was related to the}} effectiveness of these ferric compounds as electron acceptors for the metabolism of acetate. The addition of acetate or hydrogen relieved the inhibition of methane production by ferric iron. The decrease of electron equivalents proceeding to methane in sediments supplemented with amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides was compensated for by a corresponding increase of electron equivalents in ferrous iron. These results indicate that iron reduction can outcompete methanogenic food chains for sediment organic matter. Thus, when amorphous ferric oxyhydroxides are available in anaerobic sediments, the transfer of electrons from organic matter to ferric iron can be a major pathway for organic matter decomposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbon and}} energy {{metabolism}} {{of the human}} pathogen Clostridium difficile is poorly understood. Amino acid metabolism by the Stickland reactions has previously {{been described as a}} primary source of energy in a number of Clostridium species, especially when grown in a medium containing only amino acids. Deeper insights may be gained by metabolic analyses using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platforms, but such experiments are best performed in well-defined growth media. A number of C. difficile strains have been successfully cultivated on defined media but these media provide an excess of nutrients, particularly in terms of amino acid provision, resulting in undesirable background growth in the absence of glucose. To overcome these challenges, three variants of a defined medium were developed that contain the essential nutrients that support the growth of this bacterium, {{in the presence of a}} carbon and energy source such as glucose together with an LC-MS/MS method that will simultaneously measure all twenty amino acids. Since the focus in this study was amino acid utilisation, a comprehensive and most effective technique that will provide as much information as possible for understanding the metabolic requirements of eight Clostridium difficile strains (CD 630 ∆erm, DH 196, R 20291, EK 15, EK 28, R 12801, L 26, O 17 Serotype F) and two transposon mutants (CRG- 2979, CRG- 3887) was required. Due to high water solubility and the range of ionic characteristics of amino acids, an aqueous normal phase chromatographic method was considered to simultaneously separate a mixture of amino acids without derivatisation. Aqueous normal phase chromatographic method represents an important new technology with a capability of the silica-hydride-base stationary phases, offering a distinct advantage for practical application with a high degree of reproducibility and long-term stability of polar and non-polar compounds. The developed methods were subsequently adapted to study amino acid utilisation in the presence or absence of a fermentable carbohydrate and/or selenium. OD determinations were performed by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (or OD 600) using a Biomate 3 spectrophotometer. The concentration of individual amino acids remaining in the spent C. difficile culture media was measured after 24 h and/or 48 h using the developed LC-MS/MS method in order to determine which amino acids were being utilised by these organisms and in which order. This analysis should give further insight on the importance of amino acids for the survival of this bacterium in the gut, which may possibly lead to discovery of novel <b>fermentable</b> <b>products</b> and metabolic pathways and/or eventually aid in the successful control of the disease. Data obtained for CD 630 ∆erm, DH 196, R 20291, EK 15, EK 28, R 12801, L 26, O 17 Serotype F strains showed that they all grew on the fully defined medium, with different growth profiles in terms of lag phase, growth rate, and maximum OD reached. The LC-MS/MS data generated suggest that cysteine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, serine, threonine and tyrosine are preferentially utilised, both in the presence and absence of glucose. Several other amino acids, including asparagine, glycine, phenylalanine, proline and valine were also utilised but to a lesser extent. Notable in this study was the lack of glutamate utilisation, except by strain L 26, and the excretion of alanine after its initial uptake by most of the tested stains. The excretion of alanine may be due to the use of pyruvate as an amino acceptor during the degradation of preferentially fermented amino acids, whereas, glutamate is not a substrate for most C. difficile strains. Thus, LC-MS/MS profiling confirmed that these organisms derive most of their carbon and energy from the fermentation of a selected range of amino acids. Given the importance of selenium-dependent Stickland reactions to the growth of this bacterium, further studies were undertaken to evaluate the metabolism of amino acids by two different C. difficile strains (630 ∆erm, R 20291) and two transposon mutants CRG- 2979 (defective in hadB, encoding one of the two subunits of hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase required for reductive degradation of leucine) and CRG- 3887 (defective in selA encoding selenocysteine synthase) in the presence or absence of glucose/selenium. LC-MS/MS data reveal that amino acid utilisation was affected by the presence of selenite, notably proline utilisation, which could be explained by the presence of the enzyme proline reductase and the lack of glycine consumption, known to be selenium-dependent. The non-utilisation of glycine could be explained by the presence of proline which represses the formation of the necessary enzyme systems required for glycine degradation. Data generated for CRG- 2979 reveals that this mutant could only thrive in the presence of selenium when glucose is present, possibly due to the presence of proline replacing leucine as the major Stickland acceptor. The results of the transposon mutant CRG- 3887, were much of a surprise too, because this mutant was predicted to be deficient in proline and glycine breakdown which is also reliant on selenoenzymes. This suggests the presence of selenium independent proline fermentation pathway although this hypothesis is not supported by the existing literature. Experimental data provided further evidence about the ability of this bacterium to obtain its carbon and energy in the absence of a fermentable carbohydrate; by Stickland reactions and that the presence or absence of certain amino acids could repress the utilisation or biosynthesis of other amino acids...|$|R
