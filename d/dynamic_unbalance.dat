In order {{to study the}} influence of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> of wheelset on the stability, ride quality, and curving performance for a high-speed car, a detailed dynamic model of a high-speed EMU car is established using the software SIMPACK. The analysis results indicate that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> of the wheelset significantly influences the dynamic performance of the high-speed car. The increase in <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> of the wheelset will decrease the hunting critical speed, worsen the vertical ride quality, and increase the wheelset lateral force, derailment coefficient, and wheel unloading ratio.

40|$|Reaction {{wheels are}} {{rotating}} devices {{used for the}} attitude control of spacecraft. However, reaction wheels also generate undesired disturbances {{in the form of}} vibrations, which may have an adverse effect on the pointing accuracy and stability of spacecraft (optical) payloads. A disturbance model for reaction wheels was developed at Moog Bradford by combining empirical and theoretical models. The empirical data is obtained from a highly accurate reaction wheel characterization test setup from the European Space Agency and includes disturbance signals of ball bearings transmitted through the structures of the reaction wheel assembly. The theoretical model is derived from the equation of motion of a rigid rotor and a disc supported by two ball bearings including static, <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalances,</b> structural modes and gyroscopic effects of the wheel rotor. To fully model the disturbance signature of the wheel, the bearing stiffness is formulated as a function of ball pass frequency and the flexibility of the supporting structural items like the reaction wheels housing are included. Finally, the empirical model is added into the theoretical model as excitations to form a full disturbance model for reaction wheels. The resulting combined model is then validated by tests on different types of Moog Bradford reaction wheels. The validated disturbance model is used to evaluate the pointing performance of spacecraft as well as to predict micro-disturbance performance for future reaction wheel designs...|$|R

40|$|Aerostatic {{bearings}} {{are generally}} {{used in the}} field of high speed applications. The Helium Refrigerator/Liquefier (HRL) needs turbines as expansion machines to produce cooling effect which is further used for production of liquid helium. Cryogenic turbines are significantly smaller in size compared to those for room temperature applications but rotational speed is very high, about few hundred thousands of rpm and hence these have contact less gas bearings or magnetic bearings. This project involves the design and analysis of the aerostatic bearings with horizontal shaft configuration. In the aerostatic bearings, pressurized helium gas is passed through the bearings. Based on this pressure and temperature and the rotational speed of the turbines, the shaft of the turbine rotates without contact with bearing wall and the leakage between process gas and bearing gas is minimum. For different normal and offnormal operations, speeds will be different and hence the flow parameters for bearing gas flow will be controlled via control valves and the bearing should be designed to provide such contactless rotation. In this study, a theoretical analysis is presented for the load capacity, stiffness, flow rate of aerostatic journal bearing and thrust bearing with pocketed orifice. Effects of orifice diameter, radial clearance, inlet pressure and outlet pressure on load capacity, mass flow rate and stiffness have been analyzed. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>unbalances</b> like whirling of the shaft have also been covered in this study.

40|$|Disturbances in {{reaction}} wheels have been long a crucial aspect for many scientific observation missions. An accurate and reliable disturbance model {{to understand and}} evaluate the influence of reaction wheel disturbances to the spacecraft is critically needed. Several reaction wheel disturbance models have been developed over time, using both empirical and theoretical approaches [1][2]. These models are able to capture the main features of disturbances such as ball bearing vibrations, unbalance of the rotor and the resonances of the structures. However, because the disturbance measurement equipment was limited in both stiffness and sensitivity, the empirical model output was not effective. In addition, the empirical model algorithm did not include structural resonances. This paper presents an improved disturbances measurement process and a reliable disturbance model by combining an empirical and a theoretical disturbance model. The empirical model is obtained from several wheel types (18 Nms – 45 Nms) at Moog-Bradford using a microvibration test based on a dedicated reaction wheel characterization table at ESA. With {{the state of the}} art micro-vibration test facility, the empirical data has a good accuracy to be used to derive an empirical model. The empirical model also includes the transmissibility of vibration sources through up to two wheel structural resonances in all six disturbance forces and moments. The theoretical disturbance model is derived from the equation of motion of a rigid rotor and disc supported by two ball bearings. This model formulates the static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalances</b> of the wheel and the structural modes including gyroscopic effects of the rotor. Finally, the vibrations from ball bearings, which were obtained by the empirical model, are added to the theoretical model to form a combined disturbance model.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{measurement}} {{rotating speed}} exceeds 0. 3 times natural frequency, the SNR of vibration signal will be enhanced obviously in <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> measurement. The calibration method proposed by authors {{can reduce the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> measurement error due to different rotor's mass and different rotating speed along with enhancing vibration signal when rotating speed is above 0. 3 times natural frequency. The relation between unbalance mass and sensors’ signal is affected by several elements such as system damping, rotor's mass, rotating speed and so on. When rotating speed exceeds 0. 3 times natural frequency, these elements cannot be all ignored. Meanwhile increasing rotating speed can bring advantage of enhanced vibration signals. And in this situation calibration result at one fixed rotating speed cannot reach permanent effective in a wide speed range. Thus an improved calibration method is presented here based on Cubic B-spline interpolation method. Cubic B-spline's characteristics fit the systems very well based on physical model and can help in getting more accurate interpolation results. Finally, experiments on CAB 590 general balancing machine (SCHENCK, Germany) were set up and the improved permanent calibration method was proved effective and accurate enough...|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} {{vibration}} transmission {{characteristics of a}} flexible carbody and its suspended equipment, a vertical mathematical model of high-speed electric multiple unit was established with equipment excitation considered. And the <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> and impact turbulence excitation from equipment were {{taken into account in}} a single-stage and two-stage vibration isolation system, respectively. Results show that the excitation transferred to carbody increases with suspension stiffness but decreases with the equipment mass increasing; the vibration transmission can be reduced by increasing the equipment mass or reduce the suspension stiffness. To avoid vibration resonance, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>unbalance</b> frequency of equipment should be out of the possible range of the carbody flexible modes, and a small stiffness should be applied to reduce the impact turbulence. A small stiffness, however, would result in a large movement of the equipment which is limited by the static deflection requirement, while a great stiffness will transfer high frequency vibration. Therefore, a preferred stiffness should make the suspension frequency of equipment a bit greater than the first bending mode of carbody. Additionally, a 3 D rigid-flexible coupled dynamics model was built to verify the mathematical analysis, and they show good agreements. Results show that a two-stage isolation could reduce the excitation transmission and make the vibration of carbody and equipment acceptable.|$|E
