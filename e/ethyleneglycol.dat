40|$|Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) was photooxidized in a photo-Fenton {{system and}} results {{compared}} with the dark reaction. The products were analysed using GPC and HPLC. In the absence of light, PEG samples needed 490 min to reduce their w by 50 %, whereas under UV irradiation, only 10 min were necessary. The exponential decay of w with a concomitant increase in polydispersity and number of average chain scission, characterized a random chain scission mechanism. The degradation products of PEG in both systems showed the presence of lower molecular weight products, including smaller <b>ethyleneglycols</b> and formic acid.

40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigado o mecanismo de fotodegradação de polímeros e também a ação de agentes estabilizantes. Foi investigada a degradação oxidativa de polímeros solúveis em água como poli(vinilpirrolidona), PVP; poli(acrilamida), PAM e poli(etilenoglicol), PEG na presença de peróxido de hidrogênio, reagente de Fenton e sal de ferro. O PVP apresentou a menor fotoestabilidade enquanto a PAM apresentou a maior fotoestabilidade. O sal de ferro não promoveu a degradação. As soluções de PEG foram fotooxidadas com os sistemas UV/H 2 O 2, Fenton e foto-Fenton e as amostras foram analisadas por GPC e HPLC. A análise por GPC das soluções de PEG mostrou que em todas as condições oxidativas usadas, a fotooxidação leva a uma queda acentuada da Mw, caracterizando um mecanismo de quebra de cadeia aleatório. Para os três sistemas usados, a polidispersidade aumenta após a degradação, confirmando o mecanismo de quebra aleatória de cadeia. As medidas de GPC também mostraram que a velocidade de degradação é muito maior com o sistema foto-Fenton (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), seguida pelo sistema UV/H 2 O 2 (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). O uso do reagente de Fenton apresentou a menor velocidade de degradação (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Os produtos de degradação do PEG, nos três sistemas analisados, foram analisados por HPLC, sendo identificados produtos de menor peso {{molecular}}, entre eles, EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, e os ácidos glicólico e fórmico. O mecanismo envolve um processo consecutivo em que os etilenoglicóis de maior peso molecular dão origem aos de menor peso molecular. Etilenoglicóis de cadeia curta foram usados com sucesso como moléculas modelo para prever o mecanismo de fotodegradação do PEG. Fenóis primários combinados com antioxidantes secundários contendo fósforo são os sistemas estabilizantes mais efetivos, amplamente usados na estabilização do processamento e na aplicação de olefinas a longo prazo. O mecanismo de reação de hidrólise dos antioxidantes fosfito, escolhidos para diferenciar na estrutura química e no conteúdo de fósforo, é investigado através da espectrometria de massas. Substituintes diferentes em torno do átomo de fósforo mostram um efeito significativo na estabilidade dos fosfitos com substituintes fenol, produzindo estruturas hidroliticamente estáveis. The aim of {{this work}} was to investigate polymer photodegradation mechanisms and stabilizing agents. The course of photooxidative degradation of some water soluble polymers (poly(vinylpyrrolidone), PVP; poly(acrylamide), PAM and poly(ethylene glycol), PEG) {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide, Fenton reagent and iron salt has been investigated. PVP showed the lowest photostability while PAM had the greatest photostability. Iron salt was not efficient promoting degradation. PEG has been photooxidized in Fenton, photo-Fenton and UV/H 2 O 2 systems. Samples were analysed using GPC and HPLC. GPC analysis of PEG solutions showed that in all oxidizing conditions used, the photooxidation of PEG aqueous solutions leads to an abrupt decrease of Mw, which means that the degradation of PEG implies a random chain scission mechanism. Polydispersity increases after degradation in all the systems used, confirming a random chain scission mechanism. GPC analysis also showed that the rate of degradation is much higher for the photo-Fenton system (kd = 1, 010 - 4 mol. g- 1. min- 1), followed by UV/H 2 O 2 system (kd = 3, 610 - 5 mol. g- 1. min- 1). Fenton reagent has the lowest degradation rate (kd = 1, 110 - 6 mol. g- 1. min- 1). The degradation products of PEG in all oxidizing systems, were analyzed by HPLC and lower molecular weight products were detected, i. e., EG, 2 EG, 3 EG, 4 EG, glycolic and formic acids. The mechanism involved a consecutive process, were the larger <b>ethyleneglycols</b> gave rise, successively, to smaller ones.

Antigen-antibody complexes inhibited the ingestion of IGSRC and leishmania, not latex and GSRC. Rat macrophages {{were made to}} bind radio-iodinated GBSA (GIBSA). The uptake of glutaraldehyde-treated albumin was proportional to the amount of substrate the cells were incubated with over a wide concentration range.

The binding of IGSRC and leishmania to macrophages involved large areas where the interacting membranes were separated by a low density gap of constant width. The interaction of GSRC and latex with macrophages was much more patchy and irregular. Further, no redistribution of the macrophage surface polysaccharides seemed associated with the binding of GSRC.

Material and Methods: A total of 139 participants were included in the study, i. e., occupationally exposed dental professionals, students of the 3 rd, 4 th and 6 th year of dental medicine, and occupationally unexposed dental patients. They were patch-tested with methacrylic monomers and formaldehyde. The results were subjected to statistical analysis (p < 0. 05). Results: From the allergic to formaldehyde students of the 3 rd and 4 th year of dental medicine, 46. 2 % were also sensitized to MMA. Among the group of patients, the incidence of cross-sensitization to formaldehyde and methacrylic monomers was as follows: to TEGDMA – 20. 6 %, to <b>ethyleneglycol</b> dimethacrylate – 20. 7 %, to 2 -HEMA – 20. 7 % and to tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate – 24. 1 %.

Abstract: <b>Ethyleneglycol</b> diformate {{was obtained}} by esterification of <b>ethyleneglycol</b> with an excess of formic acid using an azeotropic mixture with organic solvent to remove the water. The yields obtained with benzene, toluene and dichlorometane as reaction solvents, {{in the presence of}} p-toluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst, were unsatisfactory, even using 98 % formic acid. With diisopropylether and commercial 80 % formic acid we obtained 100 % conversion of <b>ethyleneglycol</b> and 90 % yield of the diformate. The purification of the diformate by fracional distillation, liquid chromatography, or reaction with calcium hydride was not possible. Liquid-liquid extraction with water followed by vacuum distillation furnished the dry diformate with a minimum purity of 98 %. The decomposition of <b>ethyleneglycol</b> was studied in toluene, in the presence and absence of sodium formate the maximum conversion was 1. 6 % at 300 °C and 9. 3 % at 350 °C. The principal product was water in a proportion of 1 : 1 to the converted <b>ethyleneglycol.</b> The presence of the formate ion strongly accelerated the conversion. At 250 °C and 350 °C its conversion was aproximately 30 and 10 times higher respectively. The formation of ethanol, methanol, carbon dioxide and monoxide, hydrogen and light hydrocarbons was observed in lower quantities, besides the formation of <b>ethyleneglycol</b> mono- and diformate. The decomposition of <b>ethyleneglycol</b> diformate was studied in toluene in the presence and absence of sodium formate between 250 °C and 300 °C for 15, 30 and 60 min 100 % of conversion was observed after 30 min at 300 °C in the presence and 90 % after 60 min at 300 °C in the absence of sodium formate. The principal product, formed by hydrolysis of its precursor, was the monoformate, but carbon monoxide and dioxide, water and ethylene were also detected. At 300 °C hydrogen, <b>ethyleneglycol,</b> ethanol and ethane were also formed. Sodium formate strongly catalyzed the hydrolysis reactions and the water-gas shift reaction. It was verified through mass balances that, in general, the decomposition reactions are accompanied by polimerization to smaller and larger extents.

40|$|A reactor network {{design is}} being given for the {{catalytic}} manufacture of <b>ethyleneglycol.</b> This relatively new process has a potential for major cost savings above the common, industrially applied, hydration of ethyleneoxide at high temperatures. To generalize {{the design of the}} plant, the reactor section of the catalytic <b>ethyleneglycol</b> plant is optimized by postulating a reactor network superstructure, which embeds all possible structural and operadonal configuradons. Because of the presence of fixed-bed reactors, the mathematical formulation of the superstructure results in a system of algebraic and differential equations, which are discretized by the method of orthogonal collocadon on finite elements. Hence, the reactor network synthesis problem that is formulated based upon this superstructure is a large-scale non-linear programming problem. Inequality constraints are added to comply with prescribed requirements and the objecdve function is formulated to balance both the operating and the capital costs associated with the reactor secdon. The mathematical formulation of the superstrucmre is optimized with the optimization package GAMS. The optimal reactor section of the catalytic <b>ethyleneglycol</b> plant features two recycle reactors in series followed by a plugflow reactor and a flasher, whose top-stream is recycled to the first reactor in the serial configuration. The characteristics of this configuration are proven to be physically logical. The optimal reactor section offers a 16 % higher yearly profit when compared to the heuristic design. The costs {{associated with the use of}} the catalyst are the main cost determining factor, while the maximum temperature limit in the reactors is the major restrictive constraint. Apart from the ethylene glycol reactor section, the GAMS-model is able to optimize reactor networks for any kinetic mechanism and for any objective function (with or without a flasher), without requiring any extra programming effort to change the number of reactors.

In a parallel investigation, similar IPNs with only 0. 1 % branching agent showed clearly phase separation.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{exploitation of}} resveratrol is hindered by rapid phase-II conjugative metabolism in enterocytes and hepatocytes. One {{approach to the}} solution of this problem relies on prodrugs. We report the synthesis and characterization {{as well as the}} assessment of in vivo absorption and metabolism of a set of prodrugs of resveratrol in which the OH groups are engaged in the formal (−OCH 2 OR) or the more labile acetal (−OCH(CH 3) OR) linkages. As carrier group (R) of the prodrug, we have used short <b>ethyleneglycol</b> oligomers (OEG) capped by a terminal methoxy group: −O–(CH 2 CH 2 O) n–CH 3 (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6). These moieties are expected to exhibit, to a degree, the favorable properties of longer polyethyleneglycol (PEG) chains, while their relatively small size makes for a more favorable drug loading capacity. After administration of formal-based prodrugs to rats by oral gavage, significant concentrations of derivatives were measured in blood samples over several hours, in all cases except for n = 0. Absorption was maximal for n = 4. Complete deprotection to give resveratrol and its metabolites was however too slow to be of practical use. Administration of the acetal prodrug carrying tetrameric OEG chains resulted instead in the protracted presence of resveratrol metabolites in blood, consistent with a progressive regeneration of the parent molecule from the prodrug after its absorption. The results suggest that prodrugs of polyphenols based on the acetal bond and short <b>ethyleneglycol</b> oligomers of homogeneous size may be a convenient tool for the systemic delivery of the unconjugated parent compound...|$|E

The relative activity of the glucoamylase entrapped in the resin was affected by the proportion of enzyme and prepolymers in the immobilization system. The entrapped glucoamylase showed about 4. 5 times higher K_m value and about 2. 5 times lower V_ value compared with the native glucoamylase (pH 4. 5, 35 ℃, substrate : maltose).
