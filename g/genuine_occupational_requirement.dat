2500|$|Harassment and {{victimisation}} {{cannot be}} justified, but in principle {{there are exceptions}} or justifications for all forms of direct and indirect discrimination. Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement</b> because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement,</b> to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement</b> for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E

50|$|People being {{recruited}} {{to the fire}} service went through a rigorous fitness test. Very few officers were aged over 45 and none were over 50 years old. The fire service had an age limit of joining the fire service set at 30 years old. It argued this was a <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement,</b> {{for the purpose of}} ensuring fitness.

50|$|Richards J {{held that}} the {{implementation}} was adequate, though it was stressed that the exceptions would be tightly construed.First, the <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirements</b> could apply where the employers were not satisfied an applicant met its requirements, as well as where they did not in fact. Second, it was rejected that a church group under r 7(3) could dismiss a gay cleaner, dismiss a science teacher for being a lesbian or not employ a gay person at a bookshop with holy scripts, even though people may have strong convictions. Nor could a Muslim group refuse a librarian post to someone appearing to be gay. It was ‘clear from the Parliamentary material that the exception {{was intended to be}} very narrow; and… is on its proper construction, very narrow.’ That so, because it is a derogation from the equal treatment principle. Third, {{there is a difference between}} a religious organisation, such as a faith school where there can be no discrimination, and ‘for the purposes of an organised religion’ where there can. Fourth, ‘so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion’ would be an objective rather than a subjective test under r 7(3)(b)(ii).|$|R
50|$|In {{employment}} law, a {{bona fide}} occupational qualification (BFOQ) (US) or bona fide <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement</b> (BFOR) (Canada) or <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> qualification (GOQ) (UK) is a quality or an attribute that employers are allowed to consider when making decisions on the hiring and retention of employees - a quality that when considered in other contexts would constitute discrimination and thus be in violation of civil rights employment law. Such qualifications must be listed in the employment offering.|$|R

50|$|The Judge held EERBR 2003 did {{not apply}} to {{arbitrator}}s, but even if it did, it would be a <b>genuine</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement</b> under EERBR 2003 r 7. The Court of Appeal, Moore-Bick LJ for Aikens LJ and Buxton LJ, held an arbitrator appointment was a contract for provision of services, and ‘a contract personally to do any work’ which satisfied the definition of ‘employment in EERBR 2003 r 2(3), and that a party appointing an arbitrator was an ‘employer’ under r 6(1). Thus, restricting to Ismaili’s was contrary to r 6(1)(a)(c) and the exception in r 7 {{did not apply}} because being Ismaili was unnecessary for discharging an arbitrator’s functions. Because this would make the whole agreement substantially different the arbitration clause as a whole was void under EERBR 2003 Sch 4, para 1(1).|$|E
5000|$|Lord Clarke {{held that}} an arbitrator’s {{position}} could not {{fall under the}} EERBR 2003 (now the EA 2010 s 13) because {{it had to be}} construed in light of the aim of Directive 2000/78, and the jurisprudence of the ECJ. This drew a clear distinction, beyond the requirement of work for a wage in Lawrie-Blum, between those in a subordinate position, as in Allonby, and independent providers of services. An arbitrator was not subordinate, and not even a contract personally to do work. No part of the agreement was invalid.

It is argued that the CJEU had four main options in answering the questions referred by the national courts in these cases: it could have found that the employer’s rules in these cases constituted direct discrimination; it could have held that there was no direct discrimination but that there might be indirect discrimination, but that a very strict justification test should be applied; it could have concluded that there might be indirect discrimination and that a very lenient justification test should be applied; or, it could have found that the wish of customers not to have services provided by an employee wearing a headscarf is a <b>genuine</b> and determining <b>occupational</b> <b>requirement.</b> The CJEU appears to have chosen the third option, and in doing so, has missed the opportunity to take a strong lead in providing protection against religion or belief discrimination and against discrimination of minorities...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} <b>occupational</b> {{interactional}} <b>requirements</b> influence work-home enrichment. We identify two manifestations of work-home enrichment: through objective indicators of how employees allocate their time at home, and through perceptual reflections of employees on their work-home enrichment. We conceptualize <b>occupational</b> interactional <b>requirements</b> as restorative properties {{of jobs that}} provide employees with resources that they transfer to the home domain. In terms of objective indicators, our results indicate that employees transfer these resources by spending more time in resource depleting activities of caring for household members, and less time in resource replenishing activities of socializing and relaxing. This suggests that <b>occupational</b> interactional <b>requirements</b> facilitate reallocating time in the home domain. In terms of perceptual reflections, we observe that <b>occupational</b> interactional <b>requirements</b> spark employees’ vitality, which enriches their life at home. Our results attest to considering workplace interactions as resource replenishing features of jobs that provide benefits across work and life boundaries...|$|R

30|$|As Heijke and Borghans (1998) point out, {{broadening}} VE programmes {{has both}} advantages and disadvantages. The broader, or less specialised, the programme, the easier the adaptation to both <b>occupational</b> <b>requirements</b> outside the programme’s specific occupational domain and future innovations within the domain itself. A narrow programme, however, provides {{a high degree}} of specialisation in a particular discipline or specific occupation. Graduates who obtain a job in such an occupation shortly after graduation will perform better than other graduates with a broader education. If there is insufficient work in this specific occupation, they will need to resort to a different one. There, they are not likely to perform as well and will find it more difficult to adapt than those with broader training who find work in this occupation. In broadening an education programme, the lower costs of adaptation to different <b>occupational</b> <b>requirements</b> are offset by lower performance in a specialist occupation. The question of broad versus narrow education programmes therefore involves an economic trade-off between these two implications of the programme for future labour market positions.|$|R
