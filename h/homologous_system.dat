40|$|BACKGROUND: The small GTP binding protein Ras has {{important}} roles in cellular growth and differentiation. Mutant Ras is permanently active and contributes to cancer development. In its activated form, Ras interacts with effector proteins, frequently initiating a kinase cascade. In the lower eukaryotic Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Byr 2 kinase represents a Ras target {{that in terms of}} signal-transduction hierarchy can be considered a homolog of mammalian Raf-kinase. The activation mechanism of protein kinases by Ras is not understood, and there is no detailed structural information about Ras binding domains (RBDs) in nonmammalian organisms. RESULTS: The crystal structure of the Ras-Byr 2 RBD complex at 3 A resolution shows a complex architecture similar to that observed in mammalian <b>homologous</b> <b>systems,</b> with an interprotein beta sheet stabilized by predominantly polar interactions between the interacting components. The C-terminal half of the Ras switch I region contains most of the contact anchors, while on the Byr 2 side, a number of residues from topologically distinct regions are involved in complex stabilization. A C-terminal helical segment, which is not present in the known mammalian <b>homologous</b> <b>systems</b> and {{which is part of the}} auto-inhibitory region, has an additional binding site outside the switch I region. CONCLUSIONS: The structure of the Ras-Byr 2 complex confirms the Ras binding module as a communication element mediating Ras-effector interactions; the Ras-Byr 2 complex is also conserved in a lower eukaryotic system like yeast, which is in contrast to other small GTPase families. The extra helical segment might be involved in kinase activation...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of bacterial genomes encode {{a high number}} of two-component systems controlling gene expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. The Gram-positive soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum contains two <b>homologous</b> two-component <b>systems</b> (TCS) involved in the haem-dependent regulation of gene expression. Whereas the HrrSA system is crucial for utilization of haem as an alternative iron source, ChrSA is required to cope with high toxic haem levels. In this study, we analysed the interaction of HrrSA and ChrSA in C. glutamicum. Growth of TCS mutant strains, in vitro phosphorylation assays and promoter assays of PhrtBA and PhmuO fused to eyfp revealed cross-talk between both systems. Our studies further indicated that both kinases exhibit a dual function as kinase and phosphatase. Mutation of the conserved glutamine residue in the putative phosphatase motif DxxxQ of HrrS and ChrS resulted in a significantly increased activity of their respective target promoters (PhmuO and PhrtBA respectively). Remarkably, phosphatase activity of both kinases was shown to be specific only for their cognate response regulators. Altogether our data suggest the phosphatase activity of HrrS and ChrS as key mechanism to ensure pathway specificity and insulation of these two <b>homologous</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|The repressible Saccharomyces cerevisiae acid {{phosphatase}} (APase) coded by the PHO 5 gene is a cell wall glycoprotein {{that follows the}} yeast secretory pathway. We used in vitro mutagenesis to construct a deletion (delta SP) including the entire signal sequence and four amino acids of the mature sequence of APase. An APase-deficient yeast strain was transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the PHO 5 /delta SP gene. When expressed in vivo, the PHO 5 /delta SP gene product accumulated predominantly as an inactive, unglycosylated form located inside the cell. A large part of this unglycosylated precursor underwent proteolytic degradation, but up to 30 % of it was translocated, core glycosylated, and matured {{by the addition of}} mannose residues, before reaching the cell wall. It appears, therefore, that the signal sequence is important for efficient translocation and core glycosylation of yeast APase but that it is not absolutely necessary for entry of the protein into the yeast secretory pathway. mRNA obtained by in vitro transcription of PHO 5 and PHO 5 /delta SP genes were translated in vitro in the presence of either reticulocyte lysate and dog pancreatic microsomes or yeast lysate and yeast microsomes. The PHO 5 gene product was translocated and core glycosylated in the heterologous system and less efficiently in the <b>homologous</b> <b>system.</b> We were not able to detect any translocation or glycosylation of PHO 5 /delta SP gene product in the heterologous system, but a very small amount of core suppression of glycosylated material could be evidenced in the <b>homologous</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
