50|$|House crows roost communally near human habitations {{and often}} over busy streets. A study in Singapore {{found that the}} {{preferred}} roost sites were in well-lit areas {{with a lot of}} human activity, close to food sources and in tall trees with <b>dense</b> <b>crowns</b> that were separated from other trees.

5000|$|The Chinese {{and more}} so the Japanese {{chestnuts}} are both often multileadered and wide-spreading, whereas European and especially American species tend to grow very erect when planted among others, with little tapering of their columnar trunks, which are firmly set and massive. When standing on their own, they {{spread on the}} sides and develop broad, rounded, <b>dense</b> <b>crowns</b> at maturity. The two latter's foliage has striking yellow autumn colouring.|$|R
50|$|The tree {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 20 m and is {{distinguished}} by its very <b>dense</b> spherical <b>crown</b> and pubescent leaves. Its compact branch structure helps the tree conserve moisture.|$|R

50|$|The nest {{is placed}} in the <b>dense</b> <b>crown</b> of a low {{understorey}} tree where there are many twigs and stems to support its bulk, or in thorny or stinging trees, the crown of a tree fern, or in the upwardly cupped fronds of a bird's nest fern.|$|E
50|$|Cinnamomum cambodianum (Tep porou, Tep pirou or Tepirou) is a non-scented {{species of}} cinnamon, native and endemic to Cambodia. Commonly {{referred}} to as Cambodia cinnamom, C. cambodianum is an evergreen tree with a large, <b>dense</b> <b>crown,</b> growing 15-25 metres tall. The straight, cylindrical bole can be 30-80 cm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{grows to}} {{approximately}} 35 metres in height and 0.7 metre in diameter. It is evergreen and unbuttressed {{and has a}} <b>dense</b> <b>crown</b> and pink flowers. It grows primarily in riparian zones in forests along rivers. It {{can also be found}} in drier areas, including roadsides, pastures, and woodlands.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of this role of {{disturbance}} is in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the western United States, where surface fires frequently thin existing vegetation allowing for new growth. If fire is suppressed, douglas fir (Pesudotsuga menziesii), a shade tolerant species, eventually replaces the pines. Douglas firs, having <b>dense</b> <b>crowns,</b> severely limit the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor. Without sufficient light new growth is severely limited. As the diversity of surface plants decreases, animal species that rely on them diminish as well. Fire, in this case, is important not only to the species directly affected but also to many other organisms whose survival depends on those key plants.|$|R
50|$|Owing to its {{resistance}} to the original strain of Dutch elm disease, 'Vegeta' was planted in large numbers across Amsterdam after the Second World War {{as a replacement for}} 'Belgica' (Belgian Elm), but was itself eventually replaced by the Dutch cultivar 'Dodoens' following the arrival of the more lethal strain of DED in the early 1970s. http://www.amsterdamsebomen.nl. 'Vegeta' is also known to have been introduced to Eastern Europe during the 19th century; it was marketed (as U. montana vegeta) in Poland by the Ulrich nursery, Warsaw, and survives in several arboreta. The cultivar has also been planted in avenues in Thessaloniki, Greece, where it is pollarded and pruned to produce a lower, <b>denser</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A mallet is a small-tree form of Eucalyptus {{found in}} Western Australia. Unlike the mallee, it is single-stemmed and lacks a lignotuber. Trees {{of this form}} have a {{relatively}} long, slender trunk, steeply-angled branches, and often a conspicuously <b>dense</b> terminal <b>crown,</b> and sometimes form thickets.|$|R
50|$|According to Sprague's research, {{because of}} the {{location}} of the great oak tree with <b>dense</b> <b>crown</b> that crossed the trajectory of the shot from the 6th Floor of the building onto Elm Street, it is unlikely that Lee Harvey Oswald could fire from the window near where the rifle was subsequently found.|$|E

5000|$|The bark {{is fairly}} typical of ironbarks, being rough, hard and furrowed. But {{somewhat}} paler than some ironbarks. Also, the bark can be almost corky in some trees.

50|$|Melaleuca nesophila {{is a large}} shrub {{or small}} tree growing to 4.7-6 m in height by 4-5 m in width. It has greyish-white, papery bark and a <b>dense</b> <b>crown</b> which often reaches to the ground. Its leaves are {{arranged}} alternately, 11-26 mm long, 4-9 mm wide, flat, elliptic to narrow egg-shaped with rounded ends.|$|E
50|$|A {{small tree}} {{with a dark}} <b>dense</b> <b>crown</b> of leaves, up to 15 metres tall and with a trunk {{diameter}} of 25 cm. The trunk is irregular, sometimes fluted and buttressed and multi stemmed. Dark coloured bark, tough to touch with wrinkles, bumps and vertical lines. Small branches dark green to black, leaf buds with soft hairs.|$|E
5000|$|Litvinov {{noted that}} the tree [...] "differed little from U. glabra Mill." [...] :U. minor except in its erect {{branches}} and <b>dense</b> oblong <b>crown.</b> The leaves were [...] "generally smaller" [...] and the branches [...] "smooth and lighter in colour". As with the hybrid U. × androssowii, its compact branch structure helps the tree conserve moisture.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Pioneer' is {{a fast-growing}} tree {{distinguished}} by a <b>dense,</b> globular <b>crown,</b> which as it matures becomes more broad than tall, like its U. glabra parent, and casting a heavy shade. The leaves are deep green, and similar in shape to the Wych Elm, colouring {{yellow and red}} in the fall. The perfect, apetalous wind-pollinated flowers appear in early March.|$|R
30|$|The 12 -year FRI {{was within}} the range the {{historic}} pre-settlement FRI of 2 to 15 years for this region and forest type (Beaty and Taylor 2001). Within our plots, 100 % of black oak sprout clumps arising after the 2000 Storrie Fire were top-killed in the 2012 Chips reburn. Outside our sample plots, very few sprout clumps were not top-killed (i.e., only partially consumed crown). During our assessment of Storrie Fire-origin sprout clumps in 2015, we noticed that bark was still present {{on some of the}} fire-killed sprout stems; their bark was thin (less than ∼ 6 mm thickness), suggesting that the cambium was vulnerable to heat damage at this young age. The combination of thin bark, <b>dense</b> <b>crowns</b> (Crotteau et al. 2015), and highly volatile foliage (Engber and Varner 2012) likely contributed to the high top-kill rate of sprout clumps in the Chips reburn.|$|R
