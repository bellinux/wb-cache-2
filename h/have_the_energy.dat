The reason that two particles can have the same energy is that a [...] particle can have a spin of 1/2 (spin up) or a spin of −1/2 (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level.

2500|$|Fatty acids, {{stored as}} {{triglycerides}} in an organism, {{are an important}} source of energy because they are both reduced and anhydrous. The energy yield from a gram of fatty acids is approximately 9 kcal (37 kJ), compared to 4 kcal (17 kJ) for carbohydrates. Since the hydrocarbon portion of fatty acids is hydrophobic, these molecules can be stored in a relatively anhydrous (water-free) environment. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated. For example, 1 g of glycogen can bind approximately 2 g of water, which translates to 1.33 kcal/g [...] (4 kcal/3 g). This means that fatty acids can hold more than six times the amount of energy per unit of storage mass. Put another way, if the human body relied on carbohydrates to store energy, then a person would need to carry 31kg (67.5 lb) of hydrated glycogen to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> equivalent [...] to 4.6kg (10lb) of fat.|$|E

60|$|But {{although}} I {{believe that}} all this is true, I believe no less firmly that really vital and radical reform requires some vision beyond the immediate future, some realization of what human beings might make of human life if they chose.

Every man who has really sincere desire for any great amelioration in the conditions of life has first to face ridicule, then persecution, then cajolery and attempts at subtle corruption.

Had the latter been first occupied, it is doubtful whether the rocks and lagoons of the seaboard would ever have been settled. No man would have turned from the prairie sward of the Pacific to the seamed elopes of the Atlantic edge.
