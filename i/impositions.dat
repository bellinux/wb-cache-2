5|$|There {{were also}} {{conflicts}} between the king and the Scots, whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism. James, Charles's predecessor as King of Scotland, {{made it clear that}} he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English <b>impositions</b> on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637. This led to the First Bishops' War between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops' War with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.|$|E

5|$|Other {{sections}} of society included the nobility, clergy, and townsmen. Nobles, both the titled nobility and simple knights, exploited the manors and the peasants, {{although they did}} not own lands outright but were granted rights to the income from a manor or other lands by an overlord through the system of feudalism. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these lands, or fiefs, came to be considered hereditary, and in most areas {{they were no longer}} divisible between all the heirs as had been the case in the early medieval period. Instead, most fiefs and lands went to the eldest son. The dominance of the nobility was built upon its control of the land, its military service as heavy cavalry, control of castles, and various immunities from taxes or other <b>impositions.</b> Castles, initially in wood but later in stone, began to be constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries in response to the disorder of the time, and provided protection from invaders as well as allowing lords defence from rivals. Control of castles allowed the nobles to defy kings or other overlords. Nobles were stratified; kings and the highest-ranking nobility controlled large numbers of commoners and large tracts of land, as well as other nobles. Beneath them, lesser nobles had authority over smaller areas of land and fewer people. Knights were the lowest level of nobility; they controlled but did not own land, and had to serve other nobles.|$|E

40|$|In {{everyday}} conversation, much {{communication is}} achieved using indirect language. This {{is particularly true}} when we utter requests. The decision to use indirect language is influenced {{by a number of}} factors including deniability, politeness, and the degree of <b>imposition</b> on the receiver of a request. In this paper we report the results of an eye-tracking experiment examining the influence on reading of the degree of <b>imposition</b> of a request. We manipulate whether context describes {{a situation in which the}} level of <b>imposition</b> on the receiver of the request is high (which thus motivates the use of indirect language) with one in which the level of <b>imposition</b> is low (and thus does not motivate the use of indirect language). We compare the comprehension of statements that are phrased indirectly with the comprehension of statements that are phrased more directly. We find that statements phrased indirectly are read more quickly in contexts where the level of <b>imposition</b> on the receiver is high versus when the level of <b>imposition</b> is low. In contrast, we find the processing of statements phrased directly does not vary as a function of level of <b>imposition.</b> This indicates that readers use pragmatic knowledge to guide interpretation of indirect requests.

50|$|An {{element that}} is an {{essential}} component within the Conversational Constraints Theory emphasizes the role of minimizing <b>imposition.</b> The theory discusses cross-cultural differences that have been observed when studying communicative strategies in different cultures. For instance, members within collectivistic cultures view face-supporting behavior. One way this is done is through minimizing <b>imposition</b> as an important component when a member is {{in pursuit of a}} goal. There is ample reason to believe that individualistic cultures, on the other hand, do not consider face-supporting behaviors to be as important to goal oriented behavior. Conversational Constraints Theory suggests that feminine individuals place more value on minimizing their <b>imposition.</b> In contrast, individuals that are masculine tend to place less value on minimizing their <b>imposition.</b> In addition, the theory also reports that the more an individual requires approval within a given context, the higher the amount of importance they will place on minimizing their <b>imposition.</b> This occurs when the individuals are minimizing their <b>imposition</b> on hearers in a social-relational conversational constraint. In addition, this can occur in a task-oriented conversational constraint. Returning to the issue of research about conversational constraints across different cultures, researchers have noted specific concerns which are to be addressed.|$|R

25|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court {{struck down}} the <b>impositions</b> {{of the death penalty}} in each of the {{consolidated}} cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{social theory}} {{contains}} {{a tension between}} the realization of human freedom {{and the necessity of}} social rules. Liberal political theorists of the seventeenth century, such as Hobbes and Locke, saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary <b>impositions</b> that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive {{on one side of the}} road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender our freedom for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a state of nature. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, {{likewise}} {{observed that}} attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The {{situation of the}} non-electors in England — their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection {{with those who are}} electors, and their representatives — their security against oppression resulting from this connection, and the necessity of imagining a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained — the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question — should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary <b>impositions,</b> their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} climate change has {{occupied}} environmental economists {{to a large extent}} over the last decade. Among various economic and legal instruments that have been proposed for dealing with or mitigating the phenomenon, the <b>imposition</b> of energy taxation is of particular interest. Energy taxes are considered as a cost-effective instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, there are only few countries that proceeded to their implementation, due to the possible negative effects that may arise from their <b>imposition.</b> In this dissertation, the macroeconomic and sectoral effects, accruing from the <b>imposition</b> of an energy tax in Greece, are examined. For this purpose, an input-output model of the Greek economy has been developed, whose structure is based on the environmental input-output tables of the Greek economy. In the model, the <b>imposition</b> of an energy tax is being examined under eight different scenarios, whose differentiation is due to either the different - depending on the case - level of the energy tax or the exemption of branches or energy inputs from energy taxation. The empirical results show that the effects on the economic variables are mostly positive. Some of the empirical results are summarized in the following: It has been proved that, the level of prices rises, while the <b>imposition</b> of a progressive tax generates greater variations in the economic variables, compared to the case of a constant tax <b>imposition.</b> In addition, the implementation of energy taxation exemptions in various mild forms of energy induces minimal changes in variables. At last, the exemption of branches with high-energy consumption from the <b>imposition</b> of an energy tax causes a smaller shock for the Greek economy related to the case of the low-energy consumption branches exemption or the case of a common energy tax <b>imposition</b> in all branches. ...|$|R
