40|$|Abstract: Based on {{electrical}} and chemical analysis in oils of some fault transformers in Shenzhen, it {{indicates that the}} corrosive sulfur contained in insulating oils may cause faults.

At last it would wear out coil insulation. Experiments indicate that adding passivator to insulating oil is an effective method to solve the problem. Passivator can form a protection layer {{on the surface of}} copper, which can avoid copper corrupting and can stop copper deposition in the presence of potentially corrosive sulfur compounds as well. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Power {{transformer}} {{consists of}} components which are under consistent thermal and electrical stresses.

Insulation degradation will shorten the life-span of the transformer. Currently there are two methods of detecting the winding deformation which are Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) and Low Voltage Impulse Test (LVI).
