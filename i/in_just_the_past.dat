40|$|Management Information Systems often {{referred}} to as MIS is the people-oriented use of computers in business. MIS is both a field of study and a career path. It combines the foundations of computing, analysis, and business in to one field of study. MIS is a major that is growing in popularity; however, it is still unknown to many undergraduates. This thesis includes both research and creative aspects. The information gathered by research was used to generate the requirements for an information portal relating to the MIS program at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). A portal is a one stop shop for information, resources, and tools relating to a specific topic, in this case, MIS. The primary purpose of the information portal is to be a resource of vital information relating to the MIS program at UNI. This portal is directed towards three primary audiences: prospective students, current students, and alumni. The portal provides information relating to what MIS is, why to choose MIS as a major, what MIS majors can do, and what the MIS program at UNI entails. In addition, the portal provides current undergraduates with key resources for success such as potential employers, what alumni have done, and job opportunities. An information portal for the MIS program at the College of Business Administration at UNI (also referred to as UNIBusiness) does already exist; however, there are some issues with the current portal. The existing portal has not been maintained in some time and as such, it is not always the best source of information. In addition, technology has changed greatly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few years which has rendered the existing portal outdated. Currently the existing portal is not a centralized information source; information relating to MIS is currently scatted across the UNIBusiness site. Finally, the desires and expectations of students have changed greatly over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few years. Since the portal is geared primarily towards students, it must meet their desires and expectations. It is a combination of these factors that prompted this thesis, the creation of an information portal for the MIS program at UNI...|$|R

The Russia Balance Sheet provides comprehensive, balanced, and accurate information on all key aspects of Russia's developments and their implications for the United States and other nations. The book argues that, after the strained Bush-Putin years, the Obama administration must seize the initiative to define both its policy toward Russia and the agenda for the many multilateral meetings already planned. * The book offers policy prescriptions for both the United States and Russia. It is imperative that the Obama administration establish an explicit Russia policy rather than subordinating it to other issues in order to enable the administration to make necessary tradeoffs and follow up on promises. An interagency group for Russia has been created under the leadership of the National Security Council's senior director for Russia; this group should determine the Russia policy and issue an NSC directive. As a new Russia policy is crafted and an NSC directive on Russia adopted, President Obama should make a public statement on his Russia policy. * Ideally, President Obama would declare his determination to finally persuade the US Congress to graduate Russia from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. As for Russia, it should accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to secure its successful international integration and an improvement of its legal standards. The Kremlin needs to introduce transparent procurement procedures for major investments to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks. Property rights must be reinforced and renationalization stopped to ease the problems in banking and energy production. Finally, with the first full-scale summit between Presidents Obama and Medvedev to take place in Italy in July 2009, the authors argue that the two presidents should recommit to fulfilling the April 2008 Sochi Declaration and to reestablishing a broader organized cooperation mechanism between the two countries, like that of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, to promote action and accountability. ...|$|R
40|$|Behind {{the media}} and {{political}} attention focused on California prisons, which are plagued with severe levels of crowding, and a federal court {{order to reduce the}} inmate population by over 40, 000, lies one of California's best-kept secrets: the state's youth correctional custodial population has declined over 80 % <b>in</b> <b>just</b> over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade. <b>Just</b> since 2004 <b>the</b> California Youth Authority (CYA) population declined by over 5, 000 inmates. The state has already closed five major juvenile facilities and four forestry camps for juvenile offenders. A number of factors have contributed significantly to the drop in the population of the CYA. The most frequently cited is the very negative media publicity in the early 2000 s about the conditions inside facilities, the case of Farrell v. Harper in 2003, and realignment legislation passed in 2007 that required that more youthful offenders be managed at the county level. However, the CYA population began declining as early as 1997. The trend towards increased costs for counties to send youth to the CYA, and doubt that the CYA was an appropriate setting for many of the youth being sent there, had already begun in the late 1990 s. While no single factor accounts for the drastic change in the CYA population, the research presented here points to multiple forces that came together in the mid- to late- 1990 s and early 2000 s to change public perception, judicial behaviors, probation programs, sentencing policies, and state funding streams. We also find that this population reduction is particularly notable because it did not result in an increase in juvenile crime, as some had erroneously predicted...|$|R
