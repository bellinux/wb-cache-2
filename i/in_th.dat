25|$|How these {{different}} methods operate, {{the forms of}} antigen expressed, and the different profiles of T-cell help is not understood. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection {{were responsible for the}} induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence shows no dose-related differences <b>in</b> <b>TH</b> type. The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells can differentiate to secrete IL-12 (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses). pDNA injected by needle is endocytosed into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 cytokine production, while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The dental series th, nh, lh {{are always}} laminal (that is, {{pronounced}} by touching with {{the surface of}} the tongue just above the tip, called the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental with the tip of the tongue visible between the teeth, as <b>in</b> <b>th</b> in English; dental with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French t, d, n, l. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.|$|E

In {{his review of}} State of Confusion, Rolling Stone critic Parke Puterbaugh said that the song [...] "sums up the bittersweet mood that wafts through [...] in calming counterpoint to its more turbulent moments." [...] George Kalogerakis, also of Rolling Stone, [...] said in his review of the album [...] that the song was an [...] "undeniable winner," [...] claiming that [...] "hearing [...] <b>in</b> <b>th</b> crackling live version is like running into [...] old friend." [...] AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the song {{as one of the}} [...] "quieter moments" [...] on State of Confusion where the album [...] "came to life," [...] praising its [...] "buoyant nostalgia." [...] On the band's Rolling Stone biography, the song was called [...] "delightfully nostalgic." [...] Author Rob Jovanovic called the song [...] "incredibly catchy" [...] and said that, as the song's title suggested, it [...] "made [...] want to move his feet." [...] Andrew Hickey said in his book, Preservation: The Kinks' Music 1964–1974, that the track was a [...] "great pop song." [...] Thomas M. Kitts praised its [...] "big band sound" [...] in his book, Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else.|$|E

[...] The UKRC and other women's networks provide female role models, resources and support for activities that promote science to girls and women. The Women's Engineering Society, a professional association <b>in</b> <b>th</b> UK, has been supporting women in engineering and science since 1919.

Immense quantities of earth had to be moved to secure these forms of surface and it was turned to account thus:- At the boundary of the fruit garden a thick retaining wall was built; in front of this the back wall for a range of glass running right across the garden was built leaving room for fruit rooms, sheds stoke holes etc. between the two walls.

40|$|Social {{withdrawal}} {{has been}} associated with adjustment difficulties across development. Although much is known about shyness, little is known about preference-for-solitude; even less is known about its relations with adjustment across different periods of adolescence. We examined whether preference-for-solitude might be differentially associated with adjustment difficulties in early and late adolescence. Self- and parent-reports of withdrawal motivations and adjustment were collected from 234 eighth graders (113 boys; M age = 13. 43) and 204 twelfth graders (91 boys; M age = 17. 25). Results from structural equation modeling demonstrated that above and beyond the effects of shyness, preference-for-solitude was more strongly associated with adjustment difficulties <b>in</b> 8 <b>th</b> grade than <b>in</b> 12 <b>th</b> grade. Preference-for-solitude was associated with greater anxiety/depression, emotion dysregulation, and lower self-esteem <b>in</b> 8 <b>th</b> grade; these relations were not found <b>in</b> 12 <b>th</b> grade. Although preference-for-solitude was associated with lower social competence <b>in</b> both 8 <b>th</b> and 12 th grades, this relation was significantly stronger <b>in</b> 8 <b>th</b> grade than <b>in</b> 12 <b>th</b> grade. Findings suggest preference-for-solitude has closer ties to maladjustment in early adolescence than in late adolescence. Interventions targeting preferred-solitary youth in early adolescence may be particularly fruitfu...|$|R
