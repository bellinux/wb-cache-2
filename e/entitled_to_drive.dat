Those under 18 are prohibited from permanent employment in the public service, however there is no minimum age to undertake other work. As Niue has no labour law for those employed in the private sector, children who take on employment outside of the public service have no legal protection from poor working conditions or exploitation.|$|E

5000|$|Momo {{died from}} a {{motorcycle}} accident in the weeks {{following the end of}} the making of the film. The motorcycle that had the fatal accident, a Honda CB750, was lent by his friend Eleonora Giorgi, who left for a trip; the actress was later investigated for reckless expectations because Momo was not yet 18 years of age and was not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a motorcycle, according to the regulations at the time. Some time later, the singer Patrizio Sandrelli dedicated a song to his memory, which had some success, [...] "Fratello in amore" [...] ("Brother in Love"). Alessandro is buried in the cemetery of Verano, in Rome, along with his father Gabriele.|$|E

50|$|Credit default swaps (CDS) {{also played}} a {{significant}} role in the run up to the crisis. The buyer of a CDS is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the principal of the bond in the case of default. A key characteristic of a CDS is that the buyer does not have to hold a bond in order to purchase a CDS. As a result, this financial instrument allowed pessimists <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> asset prices very low. Standardization of CDS facilitated large quantities of trades.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} where, {{during each}} period of driving between any two consecutive daily rest periods, or between a daily rest period and a weekly rest period, {{there are at}} least two drivers in the vehicle to do the driving. For the first hour of multi-manning the presence of another driver or drivers is optional, but for the remainder of the period it is compulsory. This allows for a vehicle to depart from its operating centre and collect a second driver along the way, providing that this is done within 1 hour of the first driver starting work.Vehicles manned by two or more drivers are governed by the same rules that apply to single-manned vehicles, apart from the daily rest requirements.Where a vehicle is manned by two or more drivers, each driver must have a daily rest period of at least 9 consecutive hours within the 30-hour period that starts at the end of the last daily or weekly rest period.Organising drivers’ duties in such a fashion enables a crew’s duties to be spread over 21 hours. The maximum driving time for a two-man crew taking advantage of this concession is 20 hours before a daily rest is required (although only if both drivers are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> 10 hours). Under multi-manning, the ‘second’ driver in a crew may not necessarily be the same driver fromthe duration of the first driver’s shift but could in principle be any number of drivers as long as the conditions are met. Whether these second drivers could claim the multi-manning concession in these circumstances would depend on their other duties. On a multi-manning operation the first 45 minutes of a period of availability will be considered to be a break, so long as the co-driver does no work.|$|E

He later claimed that the trip was not [...] "a love trip, but a serious attempt to get rid of hate. Hatred prevents us from knowing reality as it is". He spent 23 nights in Israel and concluded that [...] "real co-operation" [...] between the two nations should be possible. Though the book sold more than 60,000 copies, a bestseller by Egyptian standards, it provoked controversy, and Salem was subsequently ostracized from the Egyptian intellectual community and expelled from its Writer's Syndicate {{as a result of his}} [...] "propaganda." [...] He did not have a play or movie script produced in Egypt after the book's publication, though he continued to contribute columns to foreign media such as the London-based Al Hayat. Salem's memoir was later adapted by Ari Roth into the play Ali Salem <b>Drives</b> <b>to</b> Israel, which had its world premiere in the US in 2005.|$|R
