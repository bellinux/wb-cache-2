40|$|Context => Passive {{samplers}} {{applied to}} groundwater are synonymous with "no-purge sampling" (ITRC, 2007). They {{can be classified}} as: - Devices that rely on diffusion and sorption to accumulate contaminants in the sampler (time-integrated samples) - C 1; - Devices that recover a <b>grab</b> <b>well</b> water sample (instantaneous measurement) - C 2; - Devices that rely on diffusion of contaminants across the sampler membrane to reach and maintain equilibrium with medium - C 3. Scientific literature shows the existence of many types of passive samplers. Studies on their effectiveness {{have been carried out}} in the USA, Germany, Denmark, etc. and they can be used in routine to monitor contaminated groundwaters. By contrast, no guidelines for the use of these samplers have been published yet in France. Objectives => We proposed to evaluate the metrological and economic relevance of passive samplers in the context of groundwater monitoring, especially for VOCs contaminations. Results => To evaluate their advantages/limitations, we tested three of them: - Passive Diffusion Bags (C 3) (Vroblesky, 2001); - Ceramic dosimeters (C 1) (Weiss, 2006); - SorbiCells (C 1) (De Jonge, 2005). These samplers have been tested over a one-year period in an industrial site contaminated by chlorinated solvents. Parameters like water table level, exposure time of the samplers, levels of contamination, etc. are considered in the study. Nine campaigns of measurements are performed to evaluate the metrological quality of these samplers. Comparisons are carried out with conventional methods of sampling. The results will then be the subject of a comparison and statistical tests. Procedures for the use of passive samplers, including handling, laboratory calibration, field deployment, advantages/disadvantages will then be published in France...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons behind}} the continual growth of the phenomenon of famers ‘planting’ cheap and substandard houses on farmland in rural China repeatedly and without government permission. The practice has been commonly interpreted by local governments as schemes instigated by greedy farmers to maximise compensation payments from the government when their properties are requisitioned for public infrastructural or private development projects. Researchers however have found that such practices are measures farmers learnt from others to insure themselves against land <b>grabs</b> as <b>well</b> as inadequate compensation offered by local governments and developers. Their vulnerability however also spanned a growing illegal industry where farmers short of cash were lured into participating in organised ‘house planting’ projects although they could be caught and put in jail by local authorities.

TR programs are robust and opportunity <b>grabbing</b> so <b>well</b> suited to hu-man/robot or robot/robot co-operative tasks. TeleoR has extensions motivated {{by the need to}} program communicating robotic agents with an extended range of task behaviours that can be cleanly programmed. Our goal was to do this without losing the elegance and simplicity of Nilsson’s language. We also {{wanted to be able to}} give TeleoR a formally defined operational semantics, building upon one we had given for TR (see Chapter 6 of [9]). The extensions, their semantics, and their implementation were developed in parallel. A methodology we can recommend. In this paper we motivate and illustrate the TR extensions in TeleoR that facilitate the programming of more complex behaviours of single task communicating robotic agents. In other papers we will describe and illustrate the quite simple further extensions to support concurrent multi-tasking, with multiple robotic resources being shared by the tasks, and we will give the formal semantics. ...|$|R

40|$|Ammodytes hexapterus or Pacific sand lance (PSL) are {{forage fish}} that {{spend most of}} their time buried in benthic {{substrate}} (Robards 1999). PSL exhibit a peculiar behavior of actively swimming into sandy substrates as a refuge to avoid predation (Gidmark et al. 2010, Robards 1999, Blaine 2006). A sand wave field was identified in the San Juan Channel, WA in 2004 and discovered to be a suitable habitat for PSL. The San Juan Channel sand wave field is non-uniform and is composed of different substrate types. While physical attributes of the sand wave field have been explored (Greene et al. 2011), there is little known about how PSL use various substrate types as habitat. I am asking the question: How does benthic substrate composition influence the abundance and distribution of Pacific sand lance in the San Juan Channel sand wave? Samples were collected from the San Juan Chanel sand wave with the use of a Van Veen grab. The abundance and size of PSL were examined in each <b>grab</b> as <b>well</b> as the substrate composition. There were apparent trends of PSL abundance decreasing as the amount of gravel increased, and increasing as the amount of sand increased in the sample (Fig 1).
