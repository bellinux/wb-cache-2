60|$|The last is {{especially}} {{the case with}} the Poke or <b>Garget</b> (Phytolacca decandra). Some which stand under our cliffs quite dazzle me with their purple stems now and early in September. They are as interesting to me as most flowers, {{and one of the most}} important fruits of our autumn. Every part is flower, (or fruit,) such is its superfluity of color,--stem, branch, peduncle, pedicel, petiole, and even the at length yellowish purple-veined leaves. Its cylindrical racemes of berries of various hues, from green to dark purple, six or seven inches long, are gracefully drooping on all sides, offering repasts to the birds; and even the sepals from which the birds have picked the berries are a brilliant lake-red, with crimson flame-like reflections, equal to anything of the kind,--all on fire with ripeness. Hence the lacca, from lac, lake. There are at the same time flower-buds, flowers, green berries, dark purple or ripe ones, and these flower-like sepals, all on the same plant.|$|E

40|$|Phenomenal {{change in}} the Library Information Service (LIS) {{industry}} is currently changing the way information is being disseminated and used in schools by pupils. Celebration School is among the schools in Zimbabwe and developing countries heavily affected by technology {{and yet at the}} same time need to fulfil its curriculum activities at the school. The emerging technologies like social networks (Facebook, MXit, MySpace, BiNu, and Whats app) are bringing in new crop of users yet challenging in library and information field. As a school, we must create enabling environments that promote strong development to ensure a viable future and systems that feeds into curriculum and teaching methods. Celebration school like any other private schools in Zimbabwe and other developing countries comprises of users born with and without technology and are at an advanced level of access information that is far beyond the norm of the society they are living in. Gone are the days when teachers used to be the only information providers. The emerging of other data and information capturing technology like podcasting is also posing to way information should be delivered by both the library and teaching community. Libraries remain and integral part in promoting education and also enlightening learning. Libraries support the curriculum, promote literacy development, and foster lifelong reading habits among children through the development of carefully selected print collections and the infusion of educational technology. The thrust of this article it attempts to evaluate the emerging technologies which include e-books and audio-visual materials, have positively and negatively affected the information delivery system and libraries in schools and among the pupils, it will also proffer the technology syndrome among the pupils and how can it be used to their advantage. An analysis of the survey focusing on the integrating the use of modern <b>gargets</b> (tablets, ipads, androids, IPhones/Smart phones and all the <b>gargets</b> used by teenagers) to delivery and share information amongst the school going teenagers will be shared. To be adopted at each stage of association development. This article discusses how libraries can underpin technology in the quest for information dissemination. The author also provides tangible solutions or recommendations for a functioning and effective modern school library that meet the school’s curricula and user community need. It also postulates how the Open Access initiative (OAI) can be used to overcome the shortage of resources in this era where books are expensive.

40|$|Wireless {{technology}} has advanced tremendously {{over the past}} decade, introducing {{a wide array of}} devices with networking abilities. Adhoc networks are dynamically created and maintained by a group of wireless enabled devices (<b>gargets)</b> with out the assistance of pre-existing infrastructure like Base Station (BS) for communication purposes. In this study, we consider the issue of performance enhancement of wireless networks in terms of `overhead messages per node and power consumption`. Minimizing power consumption is an important challenge in mobile networks. Wireless network interface is often a device`s single largest consumer of power. To fulfill the above requirements, we have designed a topology management scheme for Adhoc wireless networks. In our topology management scheme, MARI(Mobile Agents with Routing intelligence) nodes are selected in such a way that, the MARI nodes have maximum power level among their one hop neighbors and all non-MARI nodes are with in the transmission range of MARI nodes. These MARI nodes have the routing intelligence i. e. they make all decisions relating to routing. The gateway nodes having sufficient power level are selected so that they can forward packets between MARI nodes. Gateway nodes do not have routing intelligence. These MARI and gateway nodes stay continuously awake to route the packets of other member nodes...|$|R

Open cuttings near the tunnel were well advanced but delayed due to the very hard rock encountered. Spring and Mineral Creek bridges were delayed...an average of 784 men were employed.By 1879 it was reported that good progress had been made on Section One, however delays were experienced due to the difficult nature of the rock at the tunnel site. On Section One the major work was the tunnel at Cherry Gully. This construction work known locally as the big tunnel.|$|E

It was one of the major works on the second contract of the line to Stanthorpe. By the end of 1879 it was noted that:The heading of No. 2 tunnel at 84 miles 20 chains was excavated to about one-third of the total length, and a large number of bricks had been prepared in readiness for the lining.Section Two of the contract did not involve the difficulties that were encountered on the works around the Cherry Gully tunnel. was a case where the going was much easier. In common with railway construction of the time a camp would have been situated nearby to act as labour base for its workings. On Section Two some 325 men were employed at this time. In 1880 Minister for Works, John Macrossan visited the railway works and made an inspection as far as Garget's Camp. The Stanthorpe Border Post and Stannum Miner reported on his visit:The construction camps were temporary townships, and were supplied with drinking establishments, sometimes a school, contractor stores even places of worship. Some of the hotels were recorded by local correspondents and give an idea of some of the places. Edmund Power had a drinking establishment on the Second Section at Telegraph Road crossing, and also John Commerford opened the North Australian Hotel, Main Camp, at the New Tunnel on the 2nd section.Life in the camps could be a perilous affair at times, especially where hot tempers were concerned. A dispute over the return of the loan of a few shillings lead to the shooting of John O'Neil a sub-contractor on Section Two. The individual who shot O'Neil, Felix was a Frenchman. The Stanthorpe Border Post noted that O'Neil died in agony nearly six hours after the shooting. Felix made no attempt to escape. Rather he was caught by O'Neil's mates, after Felix had a leisurely breakfast, and was preparing to ride to Stanthorpe.|$|E
40|$|A {{streptococcus}} {{epidemic of}} moderate extent and severity {{was characterized by}} clinical symptoms different from the usual septic sore throat, though the organism found was culturally Streptococcus epidemicus. The infection was traced to the milk from a single quarter of the udder of a cow in a dairy of 112 cows producing an otherwise excellent grade of raw milk. A number of the milkers on the dairy farm were found infected. It was impossible to trace the infection of the cow's udder {{to any one of}} the milkers, though such an infection seems probable since the streptococcus isolated from the cow was in every respect like streptococci isolated from patients and milkers, and different from those usually found in normal cows or cows with <b>garget.</b> Certain recommendations are made to safeguard producers of raw milk against the occurrence of such epidemics...|$|E
40|$|Somatic cell counts (SCC) from a day’s milk is {{the best}} {{indicator}} {{of the extent to}} which the gland is involved in fighting a mastitis infection. The DHI program provides a monthly SCC which identifies those cows with subclinical mastitis. The DHI SCC is highly correlated to losses in milk yield. The DHI SCC program assists dairy farmers in monitoring herd subclinical mastitis status, progress in mastitis control programs such as milking practices or equipment, cow environment and dry cow therapy, and can be used in making decisions regarding cow segregation and culling. Mastitis is usually found in two forms. The first is obvious since clinical mastitis is easily recognized. Milk is abnormal, from appearance of flakes or clots to <b>garget</b> and quarters may be swollen or sensitive. However, most mastitis is subclinical. The milk appears to be normal. Bacteria usually, but not always, can be isolated in milk. Milk yield is depressed, and composition may be altered. Subclinical mastitis may become clinical. There are 15 to 40 cases of subclinical mastitis for every clinical case...|$|E

They are supposed to be associated with emotions, human qualities, seasons, festivals and passion in our life. I n India, there are more than 450 plants that can yield bright colors. Natural dyes are environment friendly such, turmeric, the brightest ofnaturally occurring yellow color is a powerful antiseptic which revitalizes the skin, (R. Siva, 2007) PunicagranatumL. (Anar) LawsoniainermisL. (henna), and manyother common natural color yielding plants(Hussein, 1997) The present study mainly focuses on some important plants having color yielding potential. As many as 25 species were screened for coloiouring. These species belonging to 25 genera and 18 families are presented in this paper. The botanical names, family,vernacular name and parts from which color is obtained and the colours fixed after treating withrecommended mordents. Natural colorants derived from flora and fauna are believed to be safe because of its nontoxic, non-carcinogenic and biodegradable in nature (Cristea&Vilarem, 2003). Different parts of the plants were used for the extraction of dyes such asbark, leaves, flowers, etc and different types of mordents were used for fixing the dye into the fabric. Study of available literature shows that several studies werecarried out on natural color yielding plants in the recent past. (A. Rashmiel. al., 2004, Debajitand Tiwari 2005, Gour 2008 and <b>Garget</b> al., 2010) color yielding plants are not properly studied with reference to Madhya Pradesh, (Tiwariand Bharat 2008), (Choudhary and Upadhyay 2011) Present work is undertaken to study the color yielding plants of Sehore district...|$|E
