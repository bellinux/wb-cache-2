50|$|<b>E-authentication</b> is a government-wide {{partnership}} that {{is supported by}} the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. <b>E-authentication</b> works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials. Those credentials or <b>e-authentication</b> ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003 memorandum was issued through the Office of Management and Budget. Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse. That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.|$|E
50|$|When {{developing}} electronic systems, {{there are}} some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) <b>E-Authentication</b> Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require <b>e-authentication,</b> and determine a proper level of assurance.|$|E

50|$|Tokens generically are {{something}} the claimant possesses and controls {{that may be}} used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In <b>e-authentication,</b> the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for <b>e-authentication</b> is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.|$|E

SAML 1.0 is of more than historical interest, however, since the US Federal <b>E-Authentication</b> Initiative has adopted SAML 1.0 as its core technology.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} <b>e-authentication</b> methods {{that can be}} used to {{authenticate}} a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize multifactor authentication (MFA).

50|$|Generally speaking, the {{approaches}} adopted in E-commerce authentication are {{basically the same}} as <b>e-authentication.</b> The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field {{that focuses on the}} transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.|$|E
5000|$|The term digital {{authentication}} {{refers to a}} group of processes where the confidence for user identities is established and presented via electronic methods to an information system. It is also referred to as <b>e-authentication.</b> The {{digital authentication}} process creates technical challenges because of the need to authenticate individuals or entities remotely over a network.The American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a generic model for digital authentication that describes the processes that are used to accomplish secure authentication: ...|$|E
50|$|DS Logon (DoD Self-service Logon or DSL) is a secure, {{self-service}} logon ID {{created by}} the Defense Manpower Data Center as an enterprise identity credential that allows individuals affiliated with the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) access to several websites using a single username and password. A DS Logon supports the Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Directive and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <b>e-Authentication</b> guidance providing {{a high level of}} authentication assurance in situations where Common Access Card (CAC) authentication is not available.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{authentication}} is {{the process}} of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Digital authentication or <b>e-authentication</b> may be used synonymously when referring to the authentication process that confirms or certifies a person's identity and works. When used in conjunction with an electronic signature, it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and identity theft has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.|$|E
50|$|A Credential Service Provider (CSP) is {{a trusted}} entity that issues {{security}} tokens or electronic credentials to subscribers. A CSP forms {{part of an}} authentication system, most typically identified as a separate entity in a Federated authentication system. A CSP may be an independent third party, or may issue credentials for its own use. The term CSP is used frequently {{in the context of}} the US government's eGov and <b>e-authentication</b> initiatives. An example of a CSP would be an online site whose primary purpose may be, for example, internet banking - but whose users may be subsequently authenticated to other sites, applications or services without further action on their part.|$|E
50|$|In an <b>e-authentication</b> model, a {{claimant}} in an authentication protocol is a subscriber to some CSP. At some point, {{an applicant}} registers with a Registration Authority (RA), which verifies {{the identity of}} the applicant, typically through the presentation of paper credentials and by records in databases. This process is called identity proofing. The RA, in turn, vouches for {{the identity of the}} applicant (and possibly other verified attributes) to a CSP. The applicant then becomes a subscriber of the CSP. The CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each subscriber and the associated tokens and credentials issued to that subscriber. There is always a relationship between the RA and CSP.|$|E
40|$|In June 2009 {{a working}} group of cross-agency subject matter experts was formed to {{identify}} and analyze the issues around <b>E-Authentication</b> and formulate recommendations for their resolution. The workgroup agreed that system owners have differing interpretations of <b>E-Authentication,</b> are investigating different solutions, and are often unable to work with agencies on <b>E-Authentication</b> implementations. As a result, some agencies have implemented compensating controls for meeting respective assurance levels. Therefore, a unified approach must be developed for meeting <b>E-Authentication</b> and single sign-on requirements, and consistently enable agencies to implement <b>E-Authentication</b> for Federal systems that are managed outside the agency, i. e. FedTraveler, eOPF, Employee Express, eQIP, CVS. This unified approach will: Establish a common understanding among system owners of what <b>E-Authentication</b> is and the value it provides for agencies; Explain/clarify OPM/GSA's role in supporting implementation of E-Authentication; Provide a standard description/definition of a common process and steps for agencies working with OPM/GSA on implementing <b>E-Authentication...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>E-Authentication</b> Mission: Public {{trust in}} the {{security}} of information exchanged over the Internet plays {{a vital role in}} the E-Gov transformation. <b>E-Authentication</b> makes that trust possible. <b>E-Authentication</b> is setting the standards for the identity proofing of individuals and businesses, based on risk of online services used. The initiative will focus on meeting the authentication business needs of the E-Gov initiatives, building the necessary infrastructure to support common, unified processes and systems for government-wide use. This will help build the trust that must be an inherent part of every online exchange between citizens and the Government. <b>E-Authentication</b> Establishes Baseline Technical Approach The <b>E-Authentication</b> Initiative has established a baseline technical architecture for the provision of authentication services to Federal agency IT systems.

30|$|In recent times, {{public and}} {{commercial}} organizations invest on secure electronic authentication (<b>e-authentication)</b> systems to reliably verify identity of individuals. Biometrics {{is one of}} the rapidly emerging technologies for <b>e-authentication</b> systems [1]. However, {{it is almost impossible to}} discuss biometrics without addressing the associated security and privacy concerns [2, 3]. Biometric data, stored either in a smart card or in a central database, incurs security and privacy risks due to increased number of attacks against identity management systems in recent years [2 – 5]. Security and privacy concerns on biometrics limit their widespread usage in real-life applications.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the amount of plagiarism and cheating in high-stakes assessment has increased with the introduction of e-assessments (QAA, 2016), which means that authenticating student identity and authorship is increasingly important for online distance higher education. The investigation reported in this paper focuses on the implementation and use in the UK of an adaptive trust-based e-assessment system known as TeSLA (An Adaptive Trust-based e-Assessment System for Learning) currently being developed by an EU-funded project involving 18 partners across 13 countries. TeSLA combines bio-metric instruments, textual analysis instruments and security instruments. This study based on Responsible Research and Innovation - RRI examines the attitudes and experiences of UK students who used the TeSLA instruments. In particular, it considers whether the students found the <b>e-authentication</b> assessment to be a practical, secure and reliable alternative to traditional proctored exams. Data includes pre- and post- questionnaires completed by 328 students of The Open University, who engaged with the TeSLA keystroke analysis and anti-plagiarism software. The findings suggest a broadly positive acceptance of these <b>e-authentication</b> technologies. However, based on statistical implicative analysis, there were important differences in the students’ responses between genders, between age groups and between students with different amounts of previous e-assessment experiences. For example, men were less concerned about providing personal data than women; middle-aged participants (41 to 50 years old) were more aware of the nuances of cheating and plagiarism; while younger students (up to 30 years old) were more likely to reject <b>e-authentication...</b>|$|E
