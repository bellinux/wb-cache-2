40|$|Spring mounds on Earth and on Mars could {{represent}} optimal niches of life development. If life ever occurred on Mars, ancient spring deposits would be excellent localities {{to search for}} morphological or chemical remnants of an ancient biosphere. In this work, we investigate models of formation and activity of well-exposed spring mounds in the Mechertate-Chrita-Sidi El Hani (MCSH) system, eastern Tunisia. We then use these models to explore possible spring mound formation on Mars. In the MCSH system, {{the genesis of the}} spring mounds is a direct consequence of groundwater upwelling, triggered by tectonics and/or hydraulics. As they are oriented preferentially along faults, they can be considered as <b>fault</b> <b>spring</b> mounds, implying a tectonic influence in their formation process. However, the hydraulic pressure generated by the convergence of aquifers towards the surface of the system also allows consideration of an origin as artesian spring mounds. In the case of the MCSH system, our geologic data presented here show that both models are valid, and we propose a combined hydro-tectonic model as the likely formation mechanism of artesian-fault spring mounds. During their evolution from the embryonic (early) to the islet (“island”) stages, spring mounds are also shaped by eolian accumulations and induration processes. Similarly, spring mounds have been suggested to be relatively common in certain provinces on the Martian surface, but their mode of formation is still a matter of debate. We propose that the tectonic, hydraulic, and combined hydro-tectonic models describing the spring mounds at MCSH could be relevant as Martian analogs because: (i) the Martian subsurface may be over pressured, potentially expelling mineral-enriched waters as spring mounds on the surface; (ii) the Martian subsurface may be fractured, causing alignment of the spring mounds in preferential orientations; and (iii) indurated eolian sedimentation and erosional remnants are common features on Mars. The spring mounds further bear diagnostic mineralogic and magnetic properties, in comparison with their immediate surroundings. Consequently, remote sensing techniques can be very useful to identify similar spring mounds on Mars. The mechanisms (tectonic and/or hydraulic) of formation and evolution of spring mounds at the MCSH system are suitable for the proliferation and protection of life respectively. Similarly, life or its resulting biomarkers on Mars may have been protected or preserved under the spring mounds...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} faulting along the Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> zone, which {{is located in the}} Coast Ranges of northern California, about 25 km north of Clear Lake (and 50 km north of the Geysers Steam Field), 75 km east of the San Andreas fault, and generally 10 to 25 km west of the zone of Coast Range thrust <b>faults.</b> The Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> appears to be restricted to an exposed 40 km long northwesterly trending belt of melange located within an undetermined thickness of Franciscan rocks. The fault forms the northwesterly end of a southeasterly trending continuous fault system, including the Green Valley fault and probably the Calavaras fault. A lineation of microearthquake epicenters along the belt of melange shows that the Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> is active. Hypocentral locations and focal mechanisms were estimated carefully for a limited number of microearthquakes along the belt of melange that were recorded at nearby stations. The hypocenters, obtained by a group hypocentral algorithm, are located along a nearly vertical, 2 - to 3 -km-wide zone that extends downward to depths of about 12 km. Most of the focal mechanisms obtained indicate right-lateral, strike-slip displacements which are in accord with the inferred Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> zone. The remaining focal mechanisms indicate predominantly dip-slip motions with fault planes of variable strike, most of which differ from the inferred fault.

40|$|Mono Basin is a northward-trending {{structural}} depression lying immediately east of {{the central}} Sierra Nevada (California) that extends from {{the northern edge of}} Long Valley Caldera towards the center of Mono Lake. The Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain forms a prominent 17 -km-long arcuate ridge within the Mono Basin. Recent studies have proposed that the volcanism and tectonism in this area is likely interrelated. Stratigraphic data suggest that a series of strong earthquakes occurred during the North Mono-Inyo eruption sequence of 1350 A. D. Geological data are consistent with rupture of the Hartley <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> during the eruption sequence. The temporal proximity of these events suggests the possibility of a causal relationship. We use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to generate a three-dimensional model of the Mono Basin and investigate the feedback mechanism between dike intrusion and slip along the Hartley <b>Springs</b> <b>fault.</b> First we combine the potential of the FEM with the Okada (1992) analytical solution for a homogeneous elastic flat half-space to validate our model.

40|$|International audienceFourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) micro-analysis of pseudotachylytes (i. e. friction-induced melts {{produced by}} seismic slip) from the Nojima fault (Japan) reveals that earthquakes almost instantaneously expel 99 wt% {{of the wall}} rock CO 2 content. Carbon is exsolved because it is upersaturated in the friction melts.

This extraordinary release of CO 2 can cause a flash fluid pressure increase in the fault plane, and therefore enhance earthquake slip or trigger aftershocks; it may also explain the anomalous discharge of carbon monitored in nearby <b>fault</b> <b>springs</b> after large earthquakes.

40|$|New {{geologic}} mapping, structural studies, geochronology, and diffusion erosion modeling {{along the}} Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault,</b> California, {{shed light on}} its Quaternary faulting history. The Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault,</b> a 26 - km-long, predominantly north-northeast-striking, west-northwest−dipping normal fault bounding {{the eastern side of}} Deep Springs Valley, cuts Jurassic batholithic rocks nonconformably overlain by middle Miocene to Pleistocene stream gravels, coarse-grained sand, tuffaceous sand, unwelded to partially welded tuff, and Bishop ash, as well as Quaternary coarse- to fine- grained alluvial fan deposits. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology yields ages of 3. 09 ± 0. 08 Ma for the unwelded tuff and 753 ± 4 ka for the Bishop ash. Holocene debris flows, a landslide, and recent alluvium bury the youngest fault scarp. The Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> is characterized by multiple fault planes and fault scarps that become progressively younger toward the basin. The dip of the fault plane varies from 20 ° to 87 ° and fault-plane and striation measurements indicate an average orientation of N 23 E, 47 NW, and N 77 E, 49 SW, respectively. The offset of Bishop ash and underlying tuff across the Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> indicates horizontal extension and vertical slip rates of ∼ 0. 7 and ∼ 0. 9 mm/yr, respectively, since the eruption of the Bishop Tuff, and ∼ 0. 2 and ∼ 0. 2 mm/yr, respectively, since the eruption of the unwelded tuff. If the vertical slip rate since the eruption of the Bishop Tuff has remained constant through time, then slip along the Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> began ca. 1. 7 Ma. Younger fault scarps {{to the west of the}} bedrock fault cut Quaternary deposits; scarp offset ranges from 0. 8 to 17. 5 m, and scarp slope angle ranges from 8 ° to 37 °. Topographic profiling of the smallest, least eroded fault scarps, with an average surface offset of 2. 7 m, indicates that these scarps developed as the result of a single earthquake and ruptured an ∼ 20 - km-long segment of the fault. Radiocarbon analyses on detrital charcoal, located in the footwall block of one of these scarps, yield an age of 1. 960 ± 0. 055 ka. Diffusion erosion modeling of these fault scarps yields an elapsed time of 1. 7 ± 0. 5 k. y. since these fault scarps formed. Making reasonable assumptions about the depth of this earthquake and shear modulus, we estimate a moment magnitude, MW ≈ 7. 0, for this earthquake. The Deep <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> is one of several displacement-transfer normal faults that define a zone of distributed deformation between subparallel right-lateral strike-slip faults east of the Sierra Nevada that make up the northern part of the Eastern California Shear Zone.

40|$|Mono Basin is a northward {{trending}} graben situated {{east of the}} Sierra Nevada {{and west}} of Cowtrack Mountains, extending from {{the northern edge of}} Long Valley Caldera towards the Bodie Hills. From a hydrographic perspective, the Mono Basin is defined by all streams that drain into Mono Lake. The Mono-Inyo Craters forms a prominent 25 -km-long volcanic complex from the NW corner of Long Valley caldera to the southern edge of Mono Lake. The late Quaternary Hartley <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> occurs along the Sierran range front between June Lake and the northern border of Long Valley Caldera. Recently it has been proposed that the manifestation of the volcanic and of the tectonic activity in this area is likely interrelated. According to Bursik et al (2003), stratigraphic data suggest that during the North Mono-Inyo eruption sequence of ~ 1350 A. D., a series of strong earthquakes occurred across the end of the North Mono explosive phase {{and the beginning of the}} Inyo explosive phase. Moreover, geological and geomorphic features of the Hartley <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> are consistent with rupture of the fault during the eruption sequence. We use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate a three-dimensional model and investigate the feedback mechanism between dike intrusion and slip along the Hartley <b>Springs</b> <b>fault.</b> We first validate our numerical model against the Okada (1985) analytical solution for a homogeneous and elastic flat half-space. Subsequently, we evaluate the distribution of local stress changes to study the influence of the Inyo Dike intrusion in ~ 1350 A.

To this end, we considered the standard Coulomb stress change as failure criterion.

In this presentation, we highlight the preliminary results of our analysis and discuss the possible future developments of this study...|$|R
40|$|The northernmost and {{relatively}} youthful {{segment of the}} San Andreas fault system is situated within a 100 + km wide zone of northwest trending strike-slip faults that includes, from west to east, the San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>faults.</b> Although the San Andreas fault is the principal strike-slip fault in this system, it has been virtually aseismic since the 1906 earthquake. Moderate levels of seismicity locate to the east along the Maacama fault and, to a lesser extent, the Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> at focal depths typical of other strike-slip faults within the San Andreas fault system in central California. North of the San Andreas fault system, within the Cape Mendocino area, earthquakes occur at depths of up to 40 km and primarily reflect internal deformation of the subducting Garda slab, and slip along the Mendocino Fracture Zone. Seismicity along the Maacama and Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>faults</b> is dominated by right-lateral to oblique-reverse slip along fault planes that dip 50 °- 75 ° to the northeast. The northern extent of seismicity along these faults terminates near the surface projection of {{the southern edge of}} the Garda slab. The onset of seismicity along these faults {{may be related to the}} abrupt change in the elastic thickness of the North American plate as it enters the asthenaspheric window. The Maacama and Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>faults</b> are strike-parallel with active reverse faults within the forearc region of the Cascadia subductian zone. This preexisting structural fabric of northwest trending reverse faults in the forearc area appears to have strongly influenced the initial slip and complexity of these faults. Continuation of the moderately dipping Maacama fault to the southeast along the steeply dipping Healdsburg and Rodgers Creek fault zones and the near-vertical Hayward and Calaveras fault zones in the San Francisco Bay area suggests that these faults evolve toward a more vertical dip to minimize the shear stresses that tend to resist plate motion...|$|R

40|$|Fault creep, {{depending}} on its rate and spatial extent, {{is thought to}} reduce earthquake hazard by releasing tectonic strain aseismically. We use Bayesian inversion and a newly expanded GPS data set to infer the deep slip rates below assigned locking depths on the San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>Faults</b> of Northern California and, for the latter two, the spatially variable interseismic creep rate above the locking depth. We estimate deep slip rates of 21. 5 ± 0. 5, 13. 1 ± 0. 8, and 7. 5 ± 0. 7 mm/yr below 16 km, 9 km, and 13 km on the San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>Faults,</b> respectively. We infer that on average the Bartlett <b>Springs</b> <b>fault</b> creeps from the Earth's surface to 13 km depth, and below 5 km the creep rate approaches the deep slip rate. This implies that microseismicity may extend below the locking depth; however, we cannot rule out the presence of locked patches in the seismogenic zone that could generate moderate earthquakes. Our estimated Maacama creep rate, while comparable to the inferred deep slip rate at the Earth's surface, decreases with depth, implying a slip deficit exists. The Maacama deep slip rate estimate, 13. 1 mm/yr, exceeds long-term geologic slip rate estimates, perhaps due to distributed off-fault strain or the presence of multiple active fault strands. While our creep rate estimates are relatively insensitive to choice of model locking depth, insufficient independent information regarding locking depths {{is a source of}} epistemic uncertainty that impacts deep slip rate estimates...|$|R
