50|$|The award {{consists}} of a medal suspended from a blue ribbon; the ribbon is suspended from a silver colored bar bearing {{the design of a}} <b>double</b> <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> knot. The medal is a silver ship's wheel with a compass inscribed inside the wheel and bearing the Sea Scouting emblem consisting of the universal BSA insignia superimposed on an anchor.|$|E
50|$|Quartermaster is {{the highest}} rank {{attainable}} by a Sea Scout and is equivalent to Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America). The Sea Scout must attend at least three quarters of all Ship meetings and special activities over eighteen months, demonstrate marlinspike seamanship and leadership skills, demonstrate the ability to teach Sea Scouting skills, complete a Quartermaster Leadership Service Project (community service project) and pass a council level board of review. The Quartermaster emblem is a medal consisting of the Sea Scout emblem on a ship's wheel that is suspended from a solid dark blue ribbon that is in turn suspended from a bar bearing {{the design of a}} <b>double</b> <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> knot. In 2011, 40 Sea Scouts attained the rank of Quartermaster, compared with over 51000 Eagle Scouts.|$|E
50|$|The knot can be tied using doubled {{lines for}} an even flatter, more {{elaborate}} appearance. A <b>doubled</b> <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> was used to ornamentally secure the lanyards on the breastplate of the US Navy Mark V diving helmet during inspection and between dives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carrick</b> <b>bend</b> loop or <b>Carrick</b> loop is a knot {{used to make}} a {{reliable}} and stable loop {{at the end of a}} rope. It is formed by the rope end turned around forming a loop and attaching to the main part using a <b>carrick</b> <b>bend.</b> The <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> itself consists of a small loop of the main part and a small loop of the end woven together in a basket weave pattern and then tightened.|$|R
50|$|Knots {{carrying}} the name single <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> can be characterised as {{being able to}} be arranged flat so that they look the same as the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> except for variations in which ropes go under which at the intersections.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, {{with so many}} permutations, the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> {{is prone}} to being tied incorrectly.|$|R
50|$|The name single <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> {{has been}} used and even {{recommended}} by many different people to refer to different knots with a similar general form to the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend.</b> All of these knots are weaker and less secure {{for the purpose of}} a bend which is the connection of two rope ends. Several have other properties which make them desirable for specific uses.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>carrick</b> <b>bend,</b> {{also called}} full <b>carrick</b> <b>bend,</b> sailor's knot, and anchor bend, {{is perhaps the}} nearest {{thing we have to}} a perfect bend. It is symmetrical, it is easy to tie, it does not slip easily in wet material, it is among the strongest of knots, it cannot jam and is readily untied. To offset this array of excellencies is the sole {{objection}} that it is somewhat bulky. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> has a {{reputation}} for strength, some tests have shown it to be as weak as 65% efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The fully {{interwoven}} diagonal <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> is {{the most}} secure variation. All other forms are inferior and not recommended as bends.|$|R
5000|$|The eight {{crossings}} {{within the}} <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> allow for many similar-looking knots to be made. The lines in a [...] "full" [...] or [...] "true" [...] <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> alternate between over and under at every crossing. There are also two ways the ends can {{emerge from the}} knot: diagonally opposed or from the same side. The latter form is also called the double coin knot. The form with the ends emerging diagonally opposed is considered more secure.|$|R
50|$|The <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> loop is reliable, {{and easy}} to untie, {{but there are no}} {{advantages}} over other loops that are easier to tie.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> is a knot {{used for}} joining two lines. It is {{particularly}} appropriate for very heavy rope or cable {{that is too}} large and stiff to easily be formed into other common bends. [...] It will not jam even after carrying a significant load or being soaked with water. [...] As with many {{other members of the}} basket weave knot family, the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend's</b> aesthetically pleasing interwoven and symmetrical shape has also made it popular for decorative purposes.|$|R
50|$|It {{takes the}} form of a <b>Carrick</b> <b>bend</b> knot {{connecting}} two ropes but the Wake knot shows the knot joining a rope and a strap.|$|R
50|$|The diamond knot {{is usually}} {{tied with a}} <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> as a first step. This results then in a knife lanyard knot {{which can be used}} as a button hole, as well as a button. There is however a tying method that does not require a <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> as a first step, and does not produce a lanyard loop that needs to be reduced when used as a button. This method {{provides}} just the button, a spherical basket weave knot, in the style of Turk's head knot or diamond knot.|$|R
50|$|When {{the ends}} of the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> are {{connected}} together, or more practically hidden behind the knot, it becomes a carrick mat. This same configuration {{is also one of the}} most basic Turk's head knots.|$|R
50|$|Knots {{which have}} been called single <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> in various {{knotting}} books include the reef knot, the sheet bend, the granny knot, the thief knot, and even several arrangements that fail to form a knot at all, and simply fall apart.|$|R
5000|$|Bourne Academy is {{situated}} on Edinburgh Crescent, {{to the north}} of the town next to the Leisure Centre. The school badge represents the [...] "Wake knot", a heraldic device referring to the Wake family, previous Lords of the Manor of Bourne, and similar to the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a knot is {{intentionally}} capsized as {{a method}} of tying another knot, as with the [...] "lightning method" [...] of tying a bowline. Some knots, such as the <b>Carrick</b> <b>bend,</b> are generally tied in one form then capsized to obtain a stronger or more stable form.|$|R
5000|$|The ends are {{traditionally}} seized to their standing part using a round seizing. For expediency, {{a series of}} double constrictor knots, drawn very tight, may also be used. [...] When seizing the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend,</b> both ends must be secured to their standing parts or the bend will slip.|$|R
50|$|The <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> is {{generally}} {{tied in a}} flat interwoven form as shown above. Without additional measures it will collapse into a different shape when tightened, {{a process known as}} capsizing, with the degree of capsizing depending on the looseness of the weave. This capsized form is both secure and stable once tightened, although it is bulkier than the seized form below. Incomplete capsizing resulting from a tight weave produces a form that is likewise secure and stable, but which is more difficult to untie, countering {{one of the advantages of}} the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend.</b> When the knot is allowed to capsize naturally under tension, considerable slippage of line through the knot can occur before tightening, so the knot should be set carefully before loading to avoid this slippage in use.|$|R
50|$|In the {{interest}} of making the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> easier to untie, especially when tied in extremely large rope, the ends may be seized to prevent the knot from collapsing when load is applied. This practice also keeps the knot's profile flatter and can ease its passage over capstans or winches.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reef}} knot and granny knot, the {{standing}} ends enter the short side, {{while in the}} double coin knot and the sheet bend, the standing ends enter the long side. Therefore, any of these knots {{could be used for}} a lanyard. In the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend,</b> which is otherwise similar to the double coin knot, the standing ends enter opposite long sides.|$|R
50|$|The diamond knot {{begins as}} a <b>Carrick</b> <b>bend</b> with the ends exiting diagonally {{opposite}} each other. When the steps below are completed the knot is rearranged and tightened so that the ends emerge from the knot parallel and opposite their own standing part. A Chinese button knot is often tied in a very similar manner, but without leaving a loop at the end.|$|R
50|$|The carrick mat is a flat woven {{decorative}} knot {{which can}} be used as a mat or pad. Its name is based on the mat's decorative-type <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> with the ends connected together, forming an endless knot. A larger form, called the prolong knot, is made by expanding the basic carrick mat by extending, twisting, and overlapping its outer bights, then weaving the free ends through them. This process may be repeated to produce an arbitrarily long mat.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{decorative}} variation, both standing ends enter {{from one side}} and both working ends exit from the other. In this configuration the knot {{is known as the}} Josephine knot (macrame) or double coin knot (Chinese knotting). This form of the <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> is found depicted in heraldry, sometimes with the tails of heraldic serpents woven (or [...] "nowed") into this knot. [...] In heraldry the knot is associated with Hereward the Wake and is known under the name Wake knot. It is depicted in the coat of arms of Bourne Town Council, Lincolnshire.|$|R
5000|$|This knot's name {{dates back}} to at least 1783, when it was {{included}} in a nautical bilingual dictionary authored by Daniel Lescallier. [...] Its origins prior to that are not known with certainty. There are several possible explanations for the name [...] "Carrick" [...] being associated with this bend. The Elizabethan era plasterwork of Ormonde Castle in Carrick-on-Suir shows numerous <b>carrick</b> <b>bends</b> molded in relief. Or the name may come from Carrick Roads—a large natural anchorage by Falmouth in Cornwall, England. The name {{may also have been}} derived from the Carrack, a medieval type of ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will please to {{overlook}} the fellow's manners sir," [...] said Fid, very coolly interposing his own hand, and just as deliberately pocketing the offering [...] "but I needn't tell as old a seaman as your Honour, that Guinea is no country to scrape down the seams of a man's behaviour in. Howsomever, I can say this much for him, which is, that he thanks your Honour just as heartily {{as if you had}} given him twice the sum. Make a bow to his Honour, boy, and do some credit to the company you have kept. And now, since this little difficulty about the money is gotten over, by my presence of mind, with your Honour's leave, I'll just step aloft, and cast loose the lashings of that bit of a tailor on the larboard fore-yard-arm. The chap was never made for a topman as you may see, sir, by the fashion in which he crosses his lower stanchions. That fellow will make a <b>carrick</b> <b>bend</b> with his legs as easily as I could do the same with a yarn of white line!" ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the loss}} to Chelsea, United welcomed Everton to Old Trafford on 21 November. With Berbatov out injured, this gave Michael Owen {{a spot in the}} {{starting}} 11. Tomasz Kuszczak also started ahead of Ben Foster due to Van der Sar's injury. United had early chances but found it very difficult to put the ball {{in the back of the}} net. Everton created few chances and were saved by Leighton Baines and Joseph Yobo in the first 20 minutes as the Toffees held on. United turned possession into goals in the 35th minute when Evra's cross was laid off by the head of Antonio Valencia to Darren Fletcher, who emphatically drilled home a spectacular half-volley past the outstretched and former Red Tim Howard in goal for the Merseysiders. Michael Owen had a half chance to extend the lead for United shortly before half time when he timed his run perfectly to stay onside and latch onto Wayne Rooney's skilful flick. However, he would have done well to score from the tight angle as Howard quickly rushed out to block his shot. <b>Carrick</b> <b>doubled</b> the champions' lead with a low left-foot drive; Giggs' cross found a way back to him after a poor shot from Rooney and took a few touches before he picked out an unmarked Carrick at the edge of the box. Valencia made it 3-0 eight minutes later with a deflected shot off Baines that wrong-footed Howard. Scholes laid it off to him as the Ecudorian made no mistake in wrapping up a comprehensive victory.|$|R
50|$|United set {{the pace}} {{at the start of}} the second leg, but it was City who made the better chances. Nevertheless, the first half passed without a goal, and United took the lead after seven minutes of the second half; City won a corner, which Craig Bellamy went across to take, but the Welsh forward was struck by {{missiles}} thrown from the United crowd. When the corner was eventually taken, the ball was cleared to Wayne Rooney, who beat his marker with a sharp turn before hitting a long diagonal ball to Ryan Giggs on the right wing. The Welshman played the ball into the box, where neither Nani nor Michael Carrick were able to get shots away, but the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the edge of the penalty area and the veteran hit a low shot into the bottom corner of the net. <b>Carrick</b> <b>doubled</b> United's lead with 20 minutes left to play, passing the ball in off the far post after a lay-off from man-of-the-match Darren Fletcher, but Carlos Tevez drew City level on aggregate five minutes later as he stretched his leg around Rio Ferdinand to flick home Craig Bellamy's left-wing cross. With the scores level going into injury time, the tie was set for a further 30 minutes of play, but Giggs played a short corner before receiving the return ball and crossing into the six-yard box, where Wayne Rooney had stolen in to head past Shay Given. The goal secured a 3-1 win for United (4-3 on aggregate) and a place in the 2010 Football League Cup Final, their second League Cup final in a row and their third in five years.|$|R
