5|$|One of {{the causes}} of insurer losses is the lower income, older and sicker enrollee population. One 2016 {{analysis}} reported that while 81% of the population with incomes from 100-150% of the federal poverty level signed up, only 45% of those from 150-200% did so. The percentage continued to <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> income rose: 2% of those above 400% enrolled.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's <b>decline,</b> <b>as</b> it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting {{that by the time}} the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.|$|E

5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population <b>decline,</b> <b>as</b> more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the salt}} {{extraction}} activities gradually went into <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt {{produced in the}} Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may <b>decline,</b> <b>as</b> these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I, the British {{upper class}} was in <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> the reduced {{workforce}} meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became {{more expensive to}} service and consequently many were converted to foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build Bourdon House in its place. Mayfair attracted commercial development after much of the City of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.|$|E
5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|In Belgium, {{the growth}} of the {{religion}} quickly begin to slow down, even to <b>decline,</b> <b>as</b> indicated by the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused {{because of a lack of}} dressed members and/or money.

On 12 September 1968, Chiprovtsi was officially proclaimed a town by the National Assembly of Bulgaria. In Socialist times, the town had a factory that {{produced}} AK-47 magazines and employed about 400 people. After the democratic changes in 1989, mining was discontinued again {{due to a lack}} of funds, the factory was closed and the carpet industry has been in <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Caxias {{became a member}} of the Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order and finally the Conservative Party. He was elected senator in 1846. The Emperor {{appointed}} him president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) in 1856; he briefly held that office again in 1861, but fell when his party lost its parliamentary majority. Over the decades Caxias witnessed the growth and zenith of his party, then its slow <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> internal conflict divided it.

However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.|$|E

5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's <b>decline</b> <b>as</b> a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
