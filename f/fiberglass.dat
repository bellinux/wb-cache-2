5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, <b>fiberglass</b> and {{borosilicate}} glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing <b>fiberglass</b> in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade <b>fiberglass</b> in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade <b>fiberglass,</b> with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Not all fiberglasses contain boron, but on {{a global}} scale, most of the <b>fiberglass</b> used does contain it. Because the {{ubiquitous}} use of <b>fiberglass</b> in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fiberglass</b> Space Race cabinet was {{designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the <b>fiberglass</b> cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the <b>fiberglass</b> cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Ride clones {{operate with}} two steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains, each {{containing}} eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train.|$|E
5|$|Boric acid (also {{known as}} orthoboric acid) H3BO3 {{is used in}} the {{production}} of textile <b>fiberglass</b> and flat panel displays and in many PVAc- and PVOH-based adhesives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fiberglass</b> is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the <b>fiberglass</b> use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|Nylon {{used in the}} Block I suits was {{replaced}} in the Block II suits with Beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from <b>fiberglass</b> and coated with Teflon.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the tower}} was {{topped with a}} glass lantern, which was {{replaced}} with a <b>fiberglass</b> one in 1973. The original lantern is now held by the Nelson Bay Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 {{would also}} make greater usage of {{composite}} materials in its construction. During its development, several areas using metal were re-designed to use <b>fiberglass,</b> {{and there were}} numerous upgrades to various mechanical parts.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and <b>fiberglass</b> forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, <b>fiberglass,</b> rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Challenge {{operated}} {{with several}} steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats {{for a total}} of 32 riders per train. The trains front seat gave a mouth resemblance while the rest gave off resemblance to hands. All the Hungarian Horntail trains resembled a blue ice dragon while all the Chinese Fireball trains resembled a red fire dragon.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing <b>fiberglass</b> covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, mostly to the rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to apply a <b>fiberglass</b> coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E
5|$|Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers. Like graphite-reinforced plastic, the composite material is {{commonly referred to as}} <b>fiberglass.</b> The glass can be {{in the form of a}} chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.|$|E

5|$|Intimidator {{operates}} {{with three}} open-air stadium style steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats each {{for a total}} of 32 riders per train. Additionally, the trains are themed after Dale Earnhardtâ€™s 1998 RCR No. 3 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} can increase wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or <b>fiberglass</b> or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span potential damage points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital {{and must be}} well attached to walls.|$|E
5|$|Nemesis Inferno {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains, each containing seven cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 28 riders per train. Two seats on Nemesis Inferno have been modified to cater for larger riders.|$|E

5|$|Krake {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains. Each train has three cars that can seat six riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 18 riders per train. The seats are black and each have a brown over-the-shoulder restraint. On each train, there are a pair of tubes that allow the water to be shot into the air as the train reaches the bottom of the first drop. Also, the trains for the roller coaster were manufactured in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Kumba {{features}} four {{steel and}} <b>fiberglass</b> trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 32 riders per train. The block sections only allow for three trains to be on the track at any one time, meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.|$|E
5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with <b>fiberglass</b> bellies and backs with a natural or man-made core.|$|E
5|$|Nitro {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and <b>fiberglass</b> trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. The structure of the trains are coloured blue, red, and yellow; the seats are black and the restraints are yellow. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Nitro has no floor on its trains.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man-made materials as <b>fiberglass,</b> carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new <b>fiberglass</b> boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began to lay a plan of attack.|$|E
