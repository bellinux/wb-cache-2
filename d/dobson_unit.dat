50|$|A later {{examination}} in 1995 {{of units}} {{for use in}} atmospheric chemistry by the Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry, {{a part of the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, discouraged the use of special names and symbols for units that {{are not part of the}} SI and are not products of powers of SI base units. Although it overlooked the 1982 article it concurred with the view that the <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> should eventually be replaced by an appropriate SI unit and that the unit mmol m-2 was the most convenient and least cumbersome option. It expressed the hope that this unit would eventually supplant the <b>Dobson</b> <b>Unit.</b> However, as of March 2017, there is little evidence that this has occurred; for example the <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> is still used by NASA and by the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center in their reporting of total ozone amount.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> (DU) is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth's atmosphere. It originated, and continues to be primarily used in respect to, atmospheric ozone, whose total column amount, usually termed [...] "total ozone", and sometimes [...] "column abundance", is dominated by the high concentrations of ozone in the stratospheric ozone layer. One <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> is equal to the number of ozone molecules needed to create a pure layer of ozone 0.01 millimeters thick at STP - standard conditions for temperature and pressure.|$|E

50|$|NASA uses a {{baseline}} value of 220 DU for ozone. This {{was chosen as}} the starting point for observations of the Antarctic ozone hole, since values of less than 220 <b>Dobson</b> <b>units</b> were not found before 1979. Also, from direct measurements over Antarctica, a column ozone level of less than 220 <b>Dobson</b> <b>units</b> {{is a result of the}} ozone loss from chlorine and bromine compounds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>Unit</b> {{is defined}} as the {{thickness}} (in units of 10 µm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at STP. This is sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' A typical column amount of 300 DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3 mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP. The <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> is named after Gordon Dobson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism monochromator to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer, has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Dobson {{units are}} often used to {{describe}} total column densities of sulfur dioxide, which occurs in the atmosphere in small amounts due to the combustion of fossil fuels, from biological processes releasing dimethyl sulfide, or by natural combustion such as forest fires. Large amounts of sulfur dioxide may be released into the atmosphere as well by volcanic eruptions. The <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> is used to describe total column amounts of sulfur dioxide because it appeared {{in the early days}} of ozone remote sensing on ultraviolet satellite instruments (such as TOMS).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Dobson</b> <b>Unit</b> is {{the total}} amount of a trace gas per unit area. In {{atmospheric}} sciences, this is referred to as a column density. How, though, do we go from units of molecules per cubic meter, a volume, to molecules per square centimeter, an area? This must be done by integration. To get a column density, we must integrate the total column over a height. Per the definition of Dobson Units, we see that 1 DU = 0.01 mm of trace gas when compressed down to sea level at standard temperature and pressure. So if we integrate our number density of air from 0 to 0.01 mm, we find the number density which is equal to 1 DU: ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Dobson</b> <b>Unit</b> is {{not part}} of the SI International System of Units. To address this shortcoming, a brief study in 1982 {{examined}} a number of alternative SI-based units suitable for column amounts of not only ozone but any gas in any planetary atmosphere and proposed the use of the unit of mole per square metre for all cases. Examples range from Earth's trace gases at levels of micro moles per square meter to Venus's carbon dioxide at mega moles per square meter. Typical values of total ozone in the Earth's atmosphere are conveniently represented in millimoles per square metre (mmol m-2.) One DU is equivalent to 0.4462 mmol m-2. One DU is also equivalent to 2.687×1020 molecules per square metre.|$|E

By studying meteorites {{he noticed that}} the temperature profile of the tropopause was not constant, as had previously been believed (hence the name stratosphere). In fact there was, he showed, a region where the temperature sharply rose. This, he proposed, was happening because UV radiation was heating ozone in what has become known as the ozone layer.He noted the connection between sunspots and weather, and measured the ultraviolet levels of our star. He built the first Dobson ozone spectrophotometers and studied the results over many years. The <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit,</b> a unit of measurement of vertically integrated atmospheric ozone density, is named after him. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a semi-eponymous model of atmospheric currents that explains the distribution of ozone by latitude.|$|E
30|$|The VMR {{gives the}} amount of a trace gas in parts per million (ppmv), e.g. 10 ppmv means 10 ozone {{molecules}} per 1 million air molecules. The TOC is measured in Dobson units (DU). One <b>Dobson</b> <b>unit</b> “refers to a layer of gas that would be 10 m thick under standard temperature and pressure” (Liu et al. 2007) and is equal to 2.69 10 ^ 16 ozone molecules/cm^ 2, or 2.69 10 ^ 20 ozone molecules/m^ 2 (Liu et al. 2007).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ratio is}} {{determined}} by turning the R-dial, which can be rotated a full 300°, on the instrument. The spectrometer compares two different wavelength intensities, UVB (305 nm) and UVA (325 nm), in order to calculate the amount of ozone. When turned, the R-dial filters and blocks out {{the light of the}} UVC wavelength until the intensity of the two wavelengths of light are equal. The ratio of the two wavelengths at incidence can be calculated once the filtered intensities are the same. The results are measured in <b>Dobson</b> <b>Units,</b> equal to 10 µm thickness of ozone compressed to Standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP) in the column. If all of the ozone in the atmospheric column one was measuring were compressed to STP, the thickness of the compressed atmosphere in mm would equal an answer in <b>Dobson</b> <b>Units</b> divided by 100.|$|R

Two broad regions of significant MJO signal are identified in the tropics, one in the western Pacific and the other in the eastern Pacific. Over both regions, MJO variations in tropospheric ozone represent 5 - 10 <b>Dobson</b> <b>Unit</b> (DU) peak-to-peak anomalies. These variations are significant compared to mean background amounts of 20 DU or less over most of the tropical Pacific.

Using a radiative transfer model treating clouds as scattering media, we investigate the e>ects of assuming opaque Lambertian clouds and employing a Partial Cloud Model (PCM) on Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) ozone retrievals, especially for tropical high-re?ectivity clouds. Assuming angularly independent cloud re?ection is good because the Ozone Retrieval Errors (OREs) are within 1. 5 % {{of the total}} ozone (i. e., within TOMS retrieval precision) when Cloud Optical Depth (COD) ¿ 20.

OMI provides daily ozone profiles for the entire sunlit portion of the earth at a horizontal resolution of 13 km× 48 km for the nadir position. The retrieved profiles have sufficient accuracy in the troposphere to see ozone perturbations caused by con-vection, biomass burning and anthropogenic pollution, and to track their spatiotemporal transport. However, to achieve such accuracy it has been necessary to calibrate OMI radi-ances carefully (using two days of Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder data taken in the tropics). The retrieved profiles contain ∼ 6 – 7 degrees of freedom for signal, with 5 – 7 in the stratosphere and 0 – 1. 5 in the troposphere.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of ozone is {{examined in the}} latest version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOSCCM) using old and new ozone-depleting substances (ODS) scenarios. This version of GEOSCCM includes a representation of the quasi-biennial oscillation, a more realistic implementation of ozone chemistry at high solar zenith angles, an improved air/sea roughness parameterization, and an extra 5 parts per trillion of CH 3 Br to account for brominated very short-lived substances. Together these additions improve the representation of ozone compared to observations. This improved version of GEOSCCM was used to simulate the ozone evolution for the A 1 2010 and the newStratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) 2013 ODS scenario derived using the SPARC Lifetimes Report 2013. This new ODS scenario results in a maximum Cltot increase of 65 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), decreasing slightly to 60 pptv by 2100.
