5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At <b>goods</b> <b>receipt</b> the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the <b>goods</b> <b>receipt</b> of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining quantity of unused material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|E

30|$|The {{literature}} review shows that much {{research has been}} done in the field of HPPS. However, most of the studied HPPS only use optimization models at the top level, while base-level decisions result from disaggregating top-level decisions. While Guimaraes (2013) ignores demand uncertainty, most of the studied HPPS assume certain demand {{at the beginning of a}} planning interval and uncertain demand in later periods (e.g., Stadtler 1988; Vogel et al. 2017). Only few HPPS consider demand uncertainty at the level at which it occurs: the short-term production planning and scheduling level (e.g., Fransoo 1993; Seipl 2009). However, the HPPS of Fransoo (1993) can only be applied to planning problems with stationary demands and assumes lost sales. Thus, non-fulfilled demand from the past does not influence current production planning decisions. The HPPS of Seipl (2009) can be applied to production planning problems with non-stationary demand. Furthermore, Seipl (2009) assumes that non-fulfilled demand from the past is backordered and must be fulfilled with the next <b>goods</b> <b>receipt,</b> prior to current period demands. Thus, the production planning problem considered in this article is closely related to the one studied in Seipl (2009).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent past, {{there seems}} to have an {{increased}} demand for improvements in current Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions. One potential area is enhancing existing master and transaction data models in ERP. This paper presents an integrated approach to represent both master and transaction data, which in turn helps improving applications within ERP system environment. Master and transaction data are modeled using unitary structures, integrating individual data elements and structures and associated functions. Functional tasks of transaction data are incorporated at structural level for improved planning and scheduling of components, such as component allocation and <b>goods</b> <b>receipt</b> processes in the production order cycle. Further, enhancement of master and transaction data can allow for forward planning of many components involved in various functional applications in ERP. Thus, potential improvements include simultaneous planning of many components (materials, resources, operations and project activities), forward planning across many applications and finite loading of resources as part of overall planning. The implementation of unitary structures in an ERP system {{can be carried out}} using additional links between existing data models. Once developed and implemented in an ERP system, data and information are visible and transactions associated with them are more flexible...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{inventory control}} in a two-echelon divergent network, {{consisting of a}} central depot and multiple (non-identical) local warehouses. Past {{research has shown that}} (R, S) order-up-to control rules for this system type can easily be obtained using a decomposition approach, where the derivation of the order-up-to level S is separated from the derivation of the rationing parameters. We show that a similar approach can be used to solve models including different shipment frequencies at the two levels. For example, a central depot receives replenishment orders every four weeks, while replenishment orders to several local warehouses are shipped weekly. In this way, inventory imbalance can be reduced compared to immediate shipment to the local warehouses after <b>goods</b> <b>receipt</b> by the central depot. A method is presented to determine the control parameters such that target fill rates for the local warehouses are obtained. Extensive experimentation with the model shows that the stock reduction is relatively small for identical holding costs throughout the network. Then the largest reduction (6. 6 %) is obtained in case of frequent resupply in the downstream part of the network. Different shipment frequencies appear to be more useful if central holding costs are (considerably) less than local holding costs...|$|E

50|$|The {{same is true}} for {{production}} scheduling: an ERP\MRP can be used to schedule production orders (to establish deadlines for their delivery) as well as to schedule <b>goods</b> <b>receipts</b> from the suppliers. It is also a very useful tool to offer data for internal usage about medium to long-term demand and\or planning or a forecast for external suppliers based on BOM explosion. But ERP\MRP is usually not very useful for scheduling operations on the shop-floor. A production planner using ERP may oversee total gross-capacity demand for all or for a certain type of operation but may not see bottlenecks on individual machines or workplaces. It is the job of the scheduling system (MES) to dispatch the production orders received from the ERP to individual machines\work places. When lean production is used (Pull), see next chapter, the production order received from the ERP usually refers to a finished product or to a more complex assembly. In this case, the scheduling system is even more important because it has to dispatch parts of the production order to individual work-places.|$|R

40|$|A medium size {{manufacturing}} company spends {{about half of}} their revenues on purchases. This has recently contributed to that procurement gained a more significant role as {{it is important to}} minimize cost in order to remain a profitable and competitive company. Time is of great importance in order to gain competitive advantages in today's market. Lead time should be short and businesses {{have to be able to}} respond to customers' requests and needs at the right time. For a company to deliver to their clients’ needs on-time, reliable suppliers are of the highest importance. If a selected supplier does not deliver on time to the company. It could come to affect the company's end customers by delays and possibly lead to large costs for the company. Delays in return could lead to dissatisfied customers. Delivery service should be measured in a supply chain. The supply chain contains of six key areas which are delivery time, delivery reliability, delivery precision, service, information and flexibility. One of the most common indicators to measure delivery service is delivery precision. Delivery precision is defined as a measure of the delivery if an order takes place on the agreed date of delivery. It is also important that the correct quantity is delivered. The purpose of this study is to identify the reasons for shortcomings in delivery service and provide suggestions for improving the measurement methods of the incoming delivery service. In order to improve delivery service the current situation should be mapped with measuring points. This is to determine where the problem in the inbound logistics can occur and where the biggest problems are today. A case study has been conducted on Alimak Hek to examine how companies generally can deal with different problems and different ways of measuring delivery service. Data collection in form of interviews, observations and data collection the business system have been conducted from different measuring points at Alimak Hek and its suppliers to create an understanding of where problem areas in the inbound logistics can be, and how delivery service can occur measured. To identify different ways to measure delivery service and to increase the understanding of the subject recent literature, journals and articles have been studied. Thirty four suppliers to Alimak Hek have been the basis for the study. Results from the study show that Alimak Hek had a number of different reasons for late deliveries from suppliers, reasons such as: unconfirmed delivery date, intake of transport, the order is not executed in accordance with the lead time, transport time varies, receiving and transport time is included in delivery performance measurement. Some of the reasons have been measured quantitatively in order to find out how much they have influenced the delivery service, while others only can be carried out in a qualitative way. Regarding delivery service the suppliers should be measured with regard to its terms of delivery, <b>goods</b> <b>receipt</b> is to be measured by its own performance measurement. The recommended measurement of the delivery service is made by measuring delivery precision, flexibility and quality. Validerat; 20160826 (global_studentproject_submitter) </p...|$|E
25|$|Passenger traffic {{began to}} drop {{following}} the Second World War as bus services became more popular; the East Kent Road Car Company ran buses which passed close to Smeeth {{on their way}} between Ashford and Folkestone, drawing off much of the railway's custom. Nationalisation in 1947 saw the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) take over responsibility for the station, and it began to implement a new policy of centring goods traffic at larger railhead depots, thereby sounding the death knell for many wayside stations across the country whose income was largely down to goods traffic. In 1953, BR proposed the closure of Smeeth Station, arguing that it would save nearly £10,000 in wages and other expenses linked with the renewal of the two platforms; the station, it said, brought in £10,322 in <b>goods</b> <b>receipts</b> and only £143 would be lost from withdrawing passenger services. The local Member of Parliament, Bill Deedes, encouraged villagers to fight the closure, but the local newspaper noted that most preferred to travel by bus or motor car.

40|$|Under {{the general}} {{conditions}} of globalized markets, customer requirements that {{are becoming more}} and more individual in terms of products and processes and more and more tumultuous surrounding conditions, many companies started to establish "holistic production systems" to cope with these higher requirements. According to this during the last years many "lean productions" were implemented with a focus that was in many cases limited to the production methods. Aspects to prevent from waste, e. g. in information flows or administrative processes, stayed unconsidered to a very large degree. The descriptions of the state of the art show, that the description of the method of lean logistics is not only necessary for production logistics, but also for further elements of the logistic chain. The effectiveness of the downsizing of lot sizes that is required in a JIT production system (one-piece-flow) on the logistic chain, particularly in consideration of reasonable minimum limits, is only inadequately described, as well. Correspondingly in the first part of the description the analysis addresses the concept and characteristics of a lean logistic system. Based on the question, if and to what extent a lean logistic contributes to the value added, requirements to logistic processes are derived following the philosophy of lean processes. From these requirements the methods for a lean logistic system are developed and described. To limit the frame for the elaboration, only elements of procurement, production and distribution logistics, as well as selected elements of the information flow are taken into consideration. Based on the considerations concerning the methods of a lean logistic system, in the second part of the analysis, a mechanized warehouse is modelled to show the effects of a downsizing of lot sizes in the sense of the one-piece-flow combined with the use of logistic methods. The developed model is restricted to the display of material flows, to prevent the scope of the elaboration from becoming too wide. The downsizing of lot sizes causes additional expenditures and attainable savings are analyzed and discussed in the context of marginal examinations. It can be shown that the one-piece-flow involves both higher expenditures due to a higher number of handling steps (e. g. in the <b>goods</b> <b>receipt)</b> and savings in the sense of the number of articles, which can be picked within a defined walking length (picking density) and therewith a reduction of routes (e. g. during commissioning). Within the frame of a total expenditure function, this way a cost minimum for the mechanized warehouse can be verified. If the developed methods of a lean logistic system are applied in a mechanized warehouse, the cost minimum can be shifted, i. e. the lot sized can be reduced without additional costs arising. Finally it is described for a special case, under which framework conditions a downsizing of lot sizes in a mechanized warehouse will stay neutral in terms of expenses. A verification of the model will finally be done by employing a practical example of a mechanized warehouse at fischerwerke Artur fischer GmbH & Co. KG and is displayed in a simulation based on real data. The implementation of selected methods of a lean logistic system is discussed and assessed at the example of fischer, as well...|$|E
