5|$|Under the {{subjective}} test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, {{the exercise of}} discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is not open to review. The court cannot enquire about the grounds and the facts <b>justifying</b> the executive's decision. In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise of discretion is reviewable by {{a court of law}} and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts <b>justifying</b> the executive's decision.|$|E

5|$|Progress {{remained}} slow through 1991 and 1992.

The regime frequently used violence {{as a tool to}} hamper reform, <b>justifying</b> its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, {{published}} in 1890, was very influential in <b>justifying</b> the naval {{program to the}} civilian government and to the general public.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in <b>justifying</b> the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: We have empirically {{noted that}} many {{physicians}} routinely request anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) without a correct clinical indication. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate retrospectively whether aPL testing at our Thrombosis Centre was <b>justified.</b> Methods: Medical records from 520 subjects for aPL screening tests for various clinical conditions were reviewed. The aPL screening tests were: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β(2) glycoptotein I (aβ(2) GPI). Requests for aPL screening were divided into <b>justified,</b> potentially <b>justified</b> or not adequately <b>justified.</b> Results: aPL testing requests were considered <b>justified</b> in 358 (69 %) patients, potentially <b>justified</b> in 66 (12. 6 %) and not adequately <b>justified</b> in 96 (18. 4 %). LA was positive in 65 (18 %) of <b>justified</b> requests and in only one (1 %) of the 96 potentially <b>justified</b> requests. None of the 66 not adequately <b>justified</b> for aPL testing was positive for LA. aβ(2) [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Foundationalism is {{an attempt}} to respond to the regress problem of {{justification}} in epistemology. According to this argument, every proposition requires justification to support it, but any justification also needs to be <b>justified</b> itself. If this goes on ad infinitum, {{it is not clear how}} anything in the chain could be <b>justified.</b> Foundationalism holds that there are 'basic beliefs' which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs. Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly <b>justified</b> belief is completely <b>justified</b> by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly <b>justified</b> beliefs require basic beliefs to be <b>justified,</b> but can be further <b>justified</b> by other factors.|$|R
5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming {{that it was too}} close to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film.

5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of <b>justifying</b> the {{lawfulness}} of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereaceae {{species were}} {{for a long}} time {{classified}} in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated Amylosterum from Stereum in 1958, <b>justifying</b> this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus (today called A.chailletii) was initially named Trichocarpus ambiguus, the name Trichocarpus had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family Malvaceae. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores.|$|E
50|$|Some modern {{typesetting}} programs offer four justification options: left <b>justify,</b> right <b>justify,</b> center <b>justify</b> {{and full}} <b>justify.</b> These variants respectively specify whether the full {{lines of a}} paragraph are aligned on the left or the right, centered (edges not aligned), or fully <b>justified</b> (spread over the whole column width). In programs that do not offer multiple kinds of justification, typically only left (for left-to-right languages) or right (for right-to-left languages) justification is provided.|$|R

5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of <b>justifying</b> the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of <b>justifying</b> the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Are there <b>justified</b> {{emotions}}? Can they <b>justify</b> evaluative judgements? We first {{explain the}} need for an account of <b>justified</b> emotions by emphasizing that emotions are states for which we have or lack reasons. We then observe that emotions are explained by their cognitive and motivational bases. Considering cognitive bases first, we argue that an emotion is <b>justified</b> if and only if the properties the subject is aware of constitute an instance of the relevant evaluative property. We then investigate the roles of motivational bases. Finally, we argue that <b>justified</b> emotions are sufficient for <b>justified</b> evaluative judgement...|$|R
