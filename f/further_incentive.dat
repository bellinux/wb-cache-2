5|$|The {{recall of}} Sir William Hamilton to Britain was a <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> for Nelson to return, {{although}} {{he and the}} Hamiltons initially sailed from Naples on a brief cruise around Malta aboard the Foudroyant in April 1800. It was on this voyage that Horatio and Emma's illegitimate daughter Horatia was probably conceived. After the cruise, Nelson conveyed the Queen of Naples and her suite to Leghorn. On his arrival, Nelson shifted his flag to , but again disobeyed Keith's orders by refusing to join the main fleet. Keith came to Leghorn in person to demand an explanation, and refused to be moved by the Queen's pleas {{to allow her to}} be conveyed in a British ship. In the face of Keith's demands, Nelson reluctantly struck his flag and bowed to Emma Hamilton's request to return to England over land.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>further</b> <b>incentive,</b> fare {{restructuring}} saw go card users offered substantial discounts {{in single}} fares over {{the price of}} paper tickets. In November 2015, Cubic was awarded a three-year contract extension until 2019.|$|E
25|$|The bay {{is home to}} a large {{variety of}} seabirds, as well as many fish species, {{including}} Great White Sharks, which are frequent visitors from the offshore islands. Seals also enter the bay, providing <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> for sharks to enter the bay.|$|E

25|$|Tsar Alexander found Russia in an {{economic}} bind as his country had {{little in the way}} of manufacturing, yet was rich in raw materials and relied heavily on trade with Napoleon's continental system for both money and manufactured goods. Russia's withdrawal from the system was a <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> to Napoleon to force a decision.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{surfaced}} {{after the}} publication of Paul Williams' The General, which claims to have insights from the Garda officers who investigated Cahill's murder. Reputedly, two of Cahill's underlings, John Gilligan and John Traynor, had put together a massive drug trafficking ring. When Cahill demanded a cut of the profits, the Gardaí believe that Traynor and Gilligan approached the IRA and suggested that Cahill was importing heroin, a drug that the IRA despised and were trying to prevent from being sold in Dublin. Reputedly this, and Cahill's past dealings with the Ulster loyalists, gave the IRA reason to order his assassination. <b>Further</b> <b>incentive</b> was provided by Gilligan, who reputedly paid the Provisional IRA a considerable sum in exchange for Cahill's assassination.|$|E
25|$|Although Mary {{was said}} to have been more {{attractive}} than her sister, Anne seems to have been more ambitious and intelligent. When the king took an interest in Anne, she refused to become his mistress, being shrewd enough not to give in to his sexual advances and returning his gifts. By the middle of 1527, Henry was determined to marry her. This gave him <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> to seek the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. A year later, when Mary's husband died during an outbreak of sweating sickness, Henry granted Anne Boleyn the wardship of her nephew, Henry Carey. Mary's husband had left her with considerable debts, and Anne arranged for her nephew to be educated at a respectable Cistercian monastery. Anne also interceded to secure her widowed sister an annual pension of£100.|$|E

25|$|Barbados {{was also}} a major {{commercial}} point to which enslaved people from the Gold Coast (essentially Ghana) were imported before further dispersal to other British colonies such as Jamaica and British Guiana. Importation of slaves from the Gold Coast to Barbados existed from the 17th century onward to about the early 19th century. The 14 April 1816 slave revolt of Barbados, {{also known as the}} Bussa Rebellion, was led by an enslaved {{man by the name of}} Bussa. Not much is known about his life prior to the revolt; scholars today are currently in dispute over his possible origins. It is highly likely that Bussa was a Coromantee, yet there is also reasonable speculation that he may have descended from the Igbo peoples of modern-day south-eastern Nigeria. It is also possible that Bussa had both ancestries, since slaves imported prior to the rebellion (mid- to late 16th-century shift in colonial demand for enslaved Africans from the Slave Coast) came primarily from the Gold Coast and underwent subsequent creolization of the island's enslaved African population. The Bussa incident, along with other persistent slave rebellions throughout the Caribbean, had given the British Colonial government a <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> to pass and enact the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 in the year 1833, officially scrapping slavery as an institution in all of its Caribbean territories.|$|E

500|$|A {{treaty was}} {{concluded}} on 10 March 1855, in which Sultan Ali formally ceded his sovereignty rights of Johor to the Temenggong permanently {{with the exception}} of the Kesang territory (around Muar). In exchange, Sultan Ali was guaranteed the recognition the title of [...] "Sultan" [...] by the Temenggong and the British government and received a lump sum of $5000 as compensation. Sultan Ali was also promised a <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> of a monthly allowance of $500 from the Temenggong, under the pressure of Governor Edmund Blundell (the British Governor of Singapore), who hoped to put an end to [...] Sultan Ali's financial complaints and problems.|$|E

40|$|This paper adds {{endogenous}} screening to Broecker (1990) {{and shows}} {{the possibility of}} multiple screening equilibria. A high intensity of screening by a bank decreases average quality of firms applying to other banks, which in turn have <b>further</b> <b>incentives</b> to screen. The link between the degree of concentration of the banking industry and the extension of credit is also discussed. Copyright (c) 2008 The Ohio State University. ...|$|R
500|$|Although coal is the {{preferred}} cooking fuel of the Malagasy people, the most affordable and prominent source of energy is timber, known as kitay. Wood is also used as a primary building material, only adding <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> to remove trees from the forest. With the depletion of dead wood from the forest patches, the people have begun to remove young, healthy trees. This is seen most commonly in areas closest to villages. [...] Although the shapes and sizes of forest fragments around the Daraina region have been mostly stable for 50years prior to a study in 2002, the six years preceding the study had seen 5% of the small- to medium-sized forest fragments disappear due to increased human encroachment.|$|E
500|$|Saints Row: The Third {{introduced}} experience {{levels and}} weapon upgrades to the series. Most {{actions in the}} game come with incentives {{in the form of}} money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades, and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like [...] "no damage from falling" [...] or [...] "infinite sprint", as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support. In turn, players receive <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets, shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, as it has in previous games. Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone menu that also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup. The computer-controlled support will also dialogue with each other.|$|E
500|$|During this time, Germany {{announced}} plans to send the battlecruiser [...] on a South American cruise. As the ship was [...] "widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat," [...] the United States and United Kingdom felt its presence might give German companies an advantage in potential armament contracts, so they sent ships of their own. The United States sent the new battleship [...] on a ten-week excursion to Brazil and Chile, carrying {{the body of the}} recently deceased Chilean minister, Anibal Cruz, to the United States; the British responded with an armored cruiser squadron. Delawares captain was ordered to give the Chileans full access to the vessel—the only exception being that he should not give full particulars of the new fire-control system—in an attempt by the Navy Department [...] "to aid the shipbuilding interests of the country [...] to make contracts for the building of men-of-war for foreign countries." [...] As a <b>further</b> <b>incentive,</b> the US indicated its willingness to provide a $25million loan to support the purchase of the ship.|$|E
50|$|Weiz, a {{small town}} 65 {{kilometers}} from the Hungarian border, has agreed to pay up to 40 per cent of the rental costs and pay <b>further</b> <b>incentives</b> if the company uses Austrian labor. Negotiations to build the Bontino car in Szentgotthárd, Hungary, had failed. Almost all components of the car are produced by Hungarian firms including Carbon Composite Kft of Pécsely and Hirschler Glas Kft of Sopron.|$|R
3000|$|..., {{there are}} even <b>further</b> <b>incentives</b> for the {{government}} to focus their audits on the manual sector. This follows as high concealment costs work as a self-regulating punishment of informal sector activities. Thus, if concealment costs are higher in the sector employing highly educated workers, this sector will be in less need of audits as concealment costs will do part of the job of limiting the size of the informal sector.|$|R
50|$|The Rome Copper City Chiefs {{continued}} to play invitational games and increased their following in and around central New York. In 1971 the Clinton Comets folded.

2500|$|Considerable {{allowances}} {{were likely}} to be voted by Parliament to any Royal Duke who married, and this acted as a <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> for William to marry. Adelaide was a princess from an unimportant German state, but William had a limited choice of available princesses and, after deals with other candidates fell through, a marriage to Adelaide was arranged. The allowance proposed was slashed by Parliament, and the outraged Duke considered calling off the marriage. However, Adelaide seemed the ideal candidate: amiable, home-loving, and willing to accept William's illegitimate children as part of the family. The arrangement was settled and William wrote to his eldest son, [...] "She is doomed, poor dear innocent young creature, to be my wife." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{the line}} drew {{out as the}} pace began to tell, though the {{rearmost}} rode grimly, knowing the risks the leaders ran, and that the chance of being first to meet the fire might yet fall to them. There was not one among them who would not have killed his best horse for that honor, and for <b>further</b> <b>incentive</b> the Colonel's niece, in streaming habit, flitted in front of them. She had come up from behind them, and passed them on a rise, for Barrington disdained to breed horses for dollars alone, and there was blood well known on the English turf in the beast she rode.|$|E

50|$|Also, {{leaders of}} growing {{metropolitan}} areas felt that attracting professional sport teams {{was an important}} way to legitimize their communities as modern cities. In order to attract teams, cities used public funding to build new stadiums.
