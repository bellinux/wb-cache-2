50|$|Lexical scoping {{was used}} for ALGOL and has been picked up in most other {{languages}} since then. <b>Deep</b> <b>binding,</b> which approximates static (lexical) scoping, was introduced in LISP 1.5 (via the Funarg device developed by Steve Russell, working under John McCarthy). The original Lisp interpreter (1960) and most early Lisps used dynamic scoping, but descendants of dynamically scoped languages often adopt static scoping; Common Lisp and Scheme (with SRFI 15) have both dynamic and static scoping. Perl is another language with dynamic scoping that added static scoping afterwards. Languages like Pascal and C have always had lexical scoping, since they are both influenced by the ideas that went into ALGOL 60 (although C did not include lexically nested functions).|$|E
50|$|Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 is a tetramer with {{molecular}} mass of about 112 kDa. In the UCK2 monomer, the active site {{is composed of}} a five-stranded β-sheet, surrounded by five α-helices and a β-hairpin loop. The β-hairpin loop in particular forms {{a significant portion of}} a <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> pocket for the uridine/cytidine substrate to moderate binding and release of substrate and products. Binding specificity for nucleosides is determined by the His-117 and Tyr-112 residues, which hydrogen bond with the 4-amino group or the 6-oxo group of cytidine and uridine, respectively. A magnesium ion is coordinated in the active site by Glu-135, Ser-34, and Asp-62. The Asp-62 residue is responsible for the catalytic activity in the enzyme active site; the acidic side chain of the Asp-62 residue deprotonates the 5’-hydroxyl group on the substrate and activates it to attack the γ-phosphorus of ATP. Structural analyses have shown that the side chain of the catalytic Asp-62 changes conformation before and after the reaction. It has been suggested that this conformational change occurs following phosphorylation, with the negatively charged Asp-62 moving away from the newly attached 5’-phosphate of the UMP/CMP product.|$|E

In the x= 0. 109 compound, the hole-like bands around the zone center Γ move to <b>deeper</b> <b>binding</b> energies and an electron pocket appears instead. The overall band renormalization remains basically the same throughout the doping range we studied, suggesting that the local magnetic/electronic correlations are not affected by carrier doping.

The bands exhibit Brillouin zone folding consistent with known BiO_ 6 breathing distortions. Though the distortions are often thought {{to coincide with}} Bi^ 3 +/Bi^ 5 + charge ordering, core level spectra show that bismuth is monovalent.

The inner membrane component AcrB is a homotrimer, {{and it has been}} postulated that the monomers cycle consecutively through three conformational stages designated loose (L), tight (T), and open (O) in a concerted fashion. Binding of drugs has been shown at a periplasmic <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> pocket in the T conformation. The initial drug-binding step and transport toward this drug-binding site has been elusive thus far. Here we report high resolution structures (1. 9 - 2. 25 Å) of AcrB/designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) complexes with bound minocycline or doxorubicin. In the AcrB/doxorubicin cocrystal structure, binding of three doxorubicin molecules is apparent, with one doxorubicin molecule bound in the <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> pocket of the T monomer and two doxorubicin molecules in a stacked sandwich arrangement in an access pocket at the lateral periplasmic cleft of the L monomer. This access pocket is separated from the <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> pocket apparent in the T monomer by a switch-loop. The localization and conformational flexibility of this loop seems to be important for large substrates, because a G 616 N AcrB variant deficient in macrolide transport exhibits an altered conformation within this loop region.

40|$|Dynamic binding, {{which has}} always been {{associated}} with Lisp, is still semantically obscure to many. Although largely replaced by lexical scoping, not only does dynamic binding remain an interesting and expressive programming technique in specialised circumstances, but also it is a key notion in semantics. This paper presents a syntactic theory that enables the programmer to perform equational reasoning on programs using dynamic binding. The theory is proved to be sound and complete with respect to derivations allowed on programs in "dynamic-environment passing style". From this theory, we derive a sequential evaluation function in a context-rewriting system. Then, we exhibit the power and usefulness of dynamic binding in two different ways. First, we prove that dynamic binding adds expressiveness to a purely functional language. Second, we show that dynamic binding is an essential notion in semantics {{that can be used}} to define the semantics of exceptions. Afterwards, we further refine the evaluation function into the popular implementation strategy called <b>deep</b> <b>binding.</b> Finally, following the saying that <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> is suitable for parallel evaluation, we present the parallel evaluation function of a future-based functional language extended with constructs for dynamic binding...|$|E

However, water-mediated hydrogen bonds and a unique cation-π sandwich stacking allow 447 - 52 D to be broadly reactive with V 3 containing both the GPGR and GPGQ crown motifs, while the <b>deeper</b> <b>binding</b> pocket and a buried Glu in the binding site of 537 - 10 D limit its reactivity to only V 3 containing the GPGR motif.

40|$|Our recent {{molecular}} dynamics simulation study of hanatoxin 1 (HaTx 1), a gating modifier that binds to the voltage sensor of K+ channels, has shown that HaTx 1 {{has the ability to}} interact with carbonyl oxygen atoms of both leaflets of the lipid bilayer membrane and to be located at a deep position within the membrane. Here we performed a similar study of GsMTx 4, a stretch-activated channels inhibitor, belonging to the same peptide family as HaTx 1. Both toxins have an ellipsoidal shape, a belt of positively charged residues around the periphery, and a hydrophobic protrusion. Results show that, like HaTx 1, GsMTx 4 can interact with the membrane in two different ways. When all the positively charged residues interact with the outer leaflet lipid, GsMTx 4 can assume a shallow binding mode. On the other hand, when the electrostatic interaction brings the positively charged groups of K- 8 and K- 28 into the vicinity of the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the inner leaflet lipids, the system exhibits a <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> mode. This deep mode is accompanied by local membrane thinning. For both HaTx 1 and GsMTx 4, our mean force measurement analyses show that the <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> mode is energetically favored over the shallow mode when a DPPC (dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine) membrane is used at 310 K. In contrast, when a POPC (palmitooleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) membrane is used at 310 K, the two binding modes exhibited similar stability for both toxins. Similar analyses with DPPC membrane at 330 K led to an intermediary result between the above two results. Therefore, the structure of the lipid acyl chains appears to influence the location and the dynamics of the toxins within biological membranes. We also compared the behavior of an arginine and a lysine residue within the membrane. This is of interest because the arginine residue interaction with the lipid carbonyl oxygen atoms mediates the <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> mode for HaTx 1, whereas the lysine residue plays that role for GsMTx 4. The arginine residue generally shows smoother dynamics near the lipid carbonyl oxygen atoms than the lysine residue. This difference between arginine and lysine may partly account for the functional diversity {{of the members of the}} toxin family...|$|E

40|$|Recombination of antiprotons with positrons (into neutral antihydrogen) in {{a strong}} {{magnetic}} field is investigated with classical models. A single antiproton in a pure- positron plasma is considered, given the very-low antiproton density in antihydrogen experiments. In these cryogenic experiments, three-body recombination dominates charge capture and produces highly-excited atoms with binding energy near the thermal level. Such atoms exist in a "guiding-center" state, characterized by ExB drift motion and adiabatically invariant cyclotron action in the positron orbit. De-excitation occurs by collisional and radiative relaxation. Radiation is small in guiding-center atoms. At deeper binding or low angular momentum, the orbit is chaotic and radiation becomes significant. Collisional de-excitation is investigated with a classical Monte-Carlo code and analytic theory. The code gives the probability w([epsilon],[epsilon]') of an atom making a collisional transition from energy [epsilon] to energy [epsilon]'. The component from collisions with large impact parameters is confirmed with analytic theory using integrals over unperturbed trajectories. A direct calculation of the drag exerted by the plasma on the bound positron orbit confirms the energy-loss rate from such collisions. It peaks when the drift velocity equals the thermal velocity. The transition rates from the Monte- Carlo simulation are used in a numerical solution of the master equation to calculate the rate of antihydrogen formation from a thermal plasma. <b>Deep</b> <b>binding</b> energies become populated as states trickle in from an invariant reservoir of thermal equilibrium atoms at shallow binding. A steady-state distribution forms at shallow binding, then propagates to <b>deep</b> <b>binding</b> over thousands of collision times.
