5|$|The Mount Cayley {{field is}} one of the largest {{volcanic}} zones in the <b>Garibaldi</b> Belt. Smaller zones include the <b>Garibaldi</b> Lake volcanic field surrounding <b>Garibaldi</b> Lake and the Bridge River Cones on the northern flank of the upper Bridge River. These areas are adjacent to Canada's populated southwest corner where the population of British Columbia is the greatest.|$|E
5|$|Varese and Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> were in Tobruk in January 1912 {{while the}} bulk of the fleet was {{refitting}} in Italy. Varese is sometimes credited with participating in the bombardment of Beirut on 24 February 1912, but it seems most probable that this was done by her sisters Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi.</b> On 18 April Varese and Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> bombarded the fortifications {{at the entrance to the}} Dardanelles, heavily damaging them. After returning to Italy later that month, Varese began a refit that included replacing her worn-out guns and lasted through mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{initially}} {{lived in}} Tucumán Province, {{where he worked}} for a government contractor. He sent for his family in 1952, and they moved to Buenos Aires. Eichmann held a series of low-paying jobs until finding employment at Mercedes-Benz, where he rose to department head. The family built a house at 14 <b>Garibaldi</b> Street (now 6061 <b>Garibaldi</b> Street) and moved in during 1960.|$|E
50|$|In 1884 {{a plaque}} commemorating <b>Garibaldi's</b> stay {{was placed on}} the building, with Meucci in attendance. The house was moved from its {{original}} nearby location in 1907 and placed within an open air colonnaded memorial pavilion, which was later removed. The memorial was dedicated in 1907 to mark <b>Garibaldi's</b> 100th birthday. Since then, the site has been the location of a number of protests and celebrations on the anniversary of <b>Garibaldi's</b> birth.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} hours of November 3, the Papal troops, under general Hermann Kanzler, and the French expeditionary corps, under general Balthazar de Polhès, moved from Rome to attack <b>Garibaldi's</b> army along the Via Nomentana. The Allies were well trained and organized, and the French troops were {{armed with the}} new Chassepot rifle; <b>Garibaldi's</b> volunteers were less well organized, and nearly without any {{artillery}} or cavalry, apart a small squadron led by <b>Garibaldi's</b> son, Ricciotti.|$|R

5|$|Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> was {{the lead}} ship of the her class of armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s. The ship often served as a {{flagship}} and made several deployments to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant during her career. At {{the beginning of the}} Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12 she bombarded Tripoli. Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> bombarded Beirut in early 1912 and sank an Ottoman ironclad there. Several months later she bombarded the defenses of the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Pierre Rives (born 1952), a 1997 inductee of the International Hall {{who entered}} the World Rugby Hall with the merger, played 59 tests for France between 1975 and 1984; {{including}} 34 as captain. He played in Five Nations Grand Slams in 1977 and 1981, and captained France to their first ever win over the All Blacks in New Zealand. Rives is now a sculptor, and designed the Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> Trophy (Italian: Trofeo Garibaldi; French: Trophée <b>Garibaldi),</b> which is competed for every year by France and Italy in the 6 Nations championship.|$|E
5|$|During the Italo-Turkish War, the Italian {{military}} {{feared that}} Ottoman naval {{forces in the}} Mediterranean would stage raid on the Italian supply and troopships headed for Italian East Africa. In order to prevent such a raid, Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel was ordered to clear the harbor of Beirut of what Ottoman naval vessels he might find there. Revel's force consisted of two armoured cruisers: Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> and Francesco Ferruccio. Both cruisers were of the Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> class and armed with two 10inch guns in turrets, ten 6inch guns, six 4.7inch guns, ten 6-pounders, ten 1-pounders, 2 Maxim machine guns, and five torpedo tubes.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Italian Harriers, {{operating}} from Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi,</b> worked alongside Italian Eurofighters and aircraft {{of other nations}} during Operation Unified Protector, part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over Libya, using the LITENING targeting pods while armed with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and AIM-9 Sidewinders. In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the <b>Garibaldi</b> Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the <b>Garibaldi</b> Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} <b>Garibaldi</b> volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1860 {{a revolt}} against the Bourbon regime broke out. Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> {{assisted}} the revolt with his forces, launching the so-called Expedition of the Thousand. He arrived at Marsala on May 11, 1860 with 1,000 Redshirts. <b>Garibaldi</b> {{announced that he was}} assuming dictatorship over Sicily in the name of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia. On May 15, the Redshirts fought the Battle of Calatafimi and within weeks Palermo was freed. FrancisII of the Two Sicilies tried to regain control of the Kingdom. On June 25, 1860 he restored the constitution of the Kingdom, adopted the Italian tricolour as the national flag, and promised special institutions for the Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In 1860, {{the flag}} of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was again {{modified}} to the defaced Italian tricolour with the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies coat of arms. Adopted on 21 June 1860, this lasted until 17 March 1861, when the Two Sicilies was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy, after its defeat in the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Italian AV-8Bs {{were used}} {{for the first time in}} combat {{missions}} when they were deployed aboard Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi,</b> which was participating in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo.

5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94.

5|$|Other {{volcanic}} techniques, such as hazard mapping, {{displays a}} volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates {{an understanding of}} the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager in the <b>Garibaldi</b> Volcanic Belt of southwestern British Columbia and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley, another volcano in the <b>Garibaldi</b> Volcanic Belt. An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{spent several}} months {{deployed}} to Albania {{after the end}} of the First Balkan War in 1913 to protect Italian interests there. Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> was sunk by an Austro-Hungarian submarine in the Adriatic Sea shortly after Italy declared war on the Central Powers in 1915 with the loss of 53 crewmen. Her wreck was discovered in 2008 and has been examined by underwater archaeologists in subsequent years.|$|E

50|$|After {{defeating}} a large Neapolitan {{force at}} Mola and organizing the siege operations around Gaeta, Fanti {{returned to the}} war office at Turin to further carry out reforms. He was instrumental in opposing <b>Garibaldi's</b> wishes to keep alive his volunteer-based army, {{with the backing of}} Prime Minister Cavour, and despite the early support of the king towards <b>Garibaldi's</b> ideas; in the end, the so-called Esercito Meridionale was disbanded, and of the 7'000 officers only as few as 1'700 were incorporated in the newly created, conscription-based Italian Army, despite <b>Garibaldi's</b> urgings to the contrary, which led to several clashes in Parliament. At the same time, Fanti looked with more favour to the admission of several officers of the defunct army of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His harsh liquidation of <b>Garibaldi's</b> forces led to him being severely criticed by the parties of the Left.|$|R

5|$|In early 1994, {{the initial}} batch of US-built {{aircraft}} arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training. The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year. In mid-January 1995, Giuseppe <b>Garibaldi</b> set off from Taranto to Somalia with three Harriers on board to maintain stability following {{the withdrawal of}} UN forces. The Harriers, flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the Rite of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry.
