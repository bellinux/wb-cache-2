40|$|Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) is {{successfully}} {{being used}} to assess the insulation condition of oil filled power transformers. However, it has to date only been implemented on de-energized transformers, which requires the transformers to be shut down for an extended period which can result in significant costs. To solve this issue, a method of implementing FDS under <b>energized</b> <b>condition</b> is proposed here. A chirp excitation waveform is used to replace the conventional sinusoidal waveform to reduce the measurement time in this method. Investigation of the dielectric response under the influence of a high voltage stress at power frequency is reported based on experimental results. To further understand the insulation ageing process, the geometric capacitance effect is removed to enhance the detection of the ageing signature.

This study analyses water droplet freezing and ion distribution in ice layer under alternating electric field. It also investigates ion migration during icing process of insulator string under alternating electric field {{and its effects on}} insulator flashover. Results showed that the average freezing time of water droplets was related to electric field strength. The extent of ion migration during freezing decreased with increasing electric field strength. The maximal melting water conductivity of the ice layer and icicle of the insulator formed under <b>energized</b> <b>condition</b> was higher than the corresponding freezing water conductivity but lower than that under non-energized condition. Furthermore, the hanging location of each insulator significantly affected the melting water conductivity of the ice layer. The surface conductivity of the ice layer increased because of the conductive ion migration in freezing water during freezing, which was an important factor that decreased the flashover voltage of the ice-covered insulator. The existence of alternating electric field would impact the extent of ion migration. This study may serve as a reference for updating prediction flashover model of ice-covered insulators during the melting period...|$|E

The enzyme {{was brought}} either into the oxidized state {{or into the}} reduced state, {{and the rate of}} ATP synthesis was measured after energisation of the proteoliposomes with an acid—base transition ΔpH (pHin = 5. 0, pHout = 8. 5) and a K+/valinomycin diffusion potential, Δφ (K+in = 0. 6 mM, K+out = 60 mM). A rate of 250 s− 1 was observed with the reduced enzyme (85 s− 1 in the absence of Δφ). A rate of 50 s− 1 was observed with the oxidized enzyme under the same conditions (15 s− 1 in the absence of Δφ). The reconstituted enzyme contained 2 ATPbound per CF 0 F 1 and 1 ADPbound per CF 0 F 1. Upon energisation the enzyme was activated and 0. 9 ADP per CF 0 F 1, was released. Binding of ADP to the active reduced enzyme was observed under different conditions. In the absence of phosphate the rate constant for ADP binding was 105 M− 1 ·s− 1 under <b>energized</b> and de-energized <b>conditions.</b> In the presence of phosphate the rate of ADP binding drastically increased under <b>energized</b> <b>conditions,</b> and strongly decreased under de-energized conditions...|$|R
40|$|Minocycline {{has been}} shown to be neuroprotective in ischemic and {{neurodegenerative}} disease models and could potentially be relevant for clinical use. We revisited the hypothesis that minocycline acts through direct inhibition of calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) resulting in reduced release of cytochrome c (cyt c). Minocycline, at high dosage, was found to prevent calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling under <b>energized</b> <b>conditions</b> similarly to the mPT inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) in rodent mitochondria derived from the CNS. In contrast to CsA, minocycline dose-dependently reduced mitochondrial calcium retention capacity (CRC) and respiratory control ratios and was ineffective in the de-energized mPT assay. Further, minocycline did not inhibit calcium- or tBid-induced cyt c release. We conclude that the neuroprotective mechanism of minocycline is likely not related to direct inhibition of mPT and propose that the mitochondrial effects of minocycline may contribute to toxicity rather than tissue protection at high dosing in animals and humans...|$|R

The triggering of this mechanism permits an alternating cycling of spermine across the mitochondrial membrane, that is spermine is transported or released by energized mitochondria in the absence or presence of ATP synthesis, respectively.

40|$|Reliability {{prediction}} plays a {{very important}} role in system design and evaluation. In order to accurately predict the system reliability, one should consider the system configuration and the failure distribution of its components. This paper discusses a multi-stage production system with one machine/tool in active state and n spares in standby state. When the operating machine/tool breaks down, a switching device detects the machine failure via the sensor and the defective tool is replaced with a functional spare, so the system can resume its operation. The Weibull Distribution {{is one of the most}} flexible failure distributions which is widely used because it can adequately describe the reliability behavior during the lifetime of present day systems. This paper assumes the operating machines/tools follow Weibull Failures, but the spares, sensor and switch failures follow exponential distribution. In addition, three assumptions are made in regard to its switch failures: (1) under the <b>energized</b> <b>condition</b> (2) under the failing-open condition (3) under the failing-closed condition. Due to the intractability of Weibull Distribtution in such a imperfect switching system, it is difficult to solve the multiple integration involved analytically. Therefore, a recursive al-gorithm using numerical integration method is developed for predicting the reliability of a multi-stage production system with m imperfect switching subsystems subject to Weibull Failures. Finally, a numerical example is also given to explain and demonstrate the practical application of the developed reliability prediction model. ...|$|E

The concentrations of free and enzyme-bound ATP, ADP and Pi were measured using either cold ATP, [γ- 32 P]ATP or [14 C]ATP. The concentration of free ATP was constant, free ADP and enzyme-bound ATP were below the detection limit. Nevertheless, [γ- 32 P]ATP was bound, hydrolyzed and 32 Pi was released. The ADP was not released from the enzyme but cold Pi was bound from the medium, cold ATP was resynthesized and released. A quantitative analysis gave the following rate constants: ATP-binding kATP = 2 · 105 M− 1 s− 1, ADP-release: kADP < 10 − 2 s− 1, Pi-release: kPi = 0. 1 s− 1. These rate constants are considerably smaller than under deenergized conditions. The rate constant {{for the release of}} ATP can be estimated to be at least 0. 2 s− 1 under <b>energized</b> <b>conditions.</b> Obviously, energization of the membrane, i. e. protonation of the enzyme leads mainly to a decrease of the rate of ATP-binding, to an increase of the rate of ATP release and to a decrease of the rate of ADP-release...|$|R

The ratio of enzyme-bound ADP to ATP was 0. 55 ± 0. 05. In a second experiment, uni-site ATP hydrolysis under <b>energized</b> <b>conditions</b> was initiated by the addition of 36 nM [α- 32 P]ATP; enzyme-bound and free nucleotides were separated by a pressure column.

In a third experiment, uni-site ATP hydrolysis under de-energized conditions was initiated by the addition of 39 nM [α- 32 P]ATP and NH 4 Cl/valinomycin in the absence of illumination. Free and enzyme-bound nucleotides were separated also by a pressure column. The ratio of enzyme-bound ADP to ATP was 0. 43 ± 0. 02. This ratio was always the same irrespective of whether the reaction runs in the synthesis or the hydrolysis direction. Furthermore, the ratio does not depend on the membrane energization.

However, release was greatly reduced {{by the presence of}} 5 % (w/v) dextran (40 kDa), which caused a decrease in the light scattering (A(520)) of mitochondrial suspensions. Dextran also inhibited both mitochondrial oxidation of exogenous ferrocytochrome c in the presence of rotenone and antimycin, and respiratory-chain-driven reduction of exogenous ferricytochrome c. Hypo-osmotic medium or digitonin treatment of mitochondria caused a large additional release of both cytochrome c and AK that was not blocked by dextran. Polyaspartate, which stabilizes the low conductance state of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), increased cytochrome c release. VDAC and BAX are both found at the contact sites between the inner and outer membranes and dextran is known to stabilize these contact sites in isolated mitochondria. Thus our data suggest that regulation of a specific permeability pathway for cytochrome c may be mediated by changes in protein-protein interactions within contact sites. The adenine nucleotide translocase is known to bind to VDAC and thus provides an additional link between the specific cytochrome c release pathway and the permeability transitio...|$|R

The total ATPase {{activity in}} permeabilized cells of this mutant was elevated three-fold {{as compared with}} the wild-type strain. In contrast to wild-type cells, mutant ATPase was neither inhibited by DCCD nor stimulated by Na+ ions. The methane formation rate of the mutant cells at pH 7. 5 under non-growing conditions was nearly twice that of the wild-type strain and was stimulated by sodium ions. On the other hand, the ATP synthesis driven by methanogenesis under the same conditions was lower that of the wild-type under the same conditions, and contrary to the wild-type was not stimulated by Na+ ions. ATP synthesis driven by a potassium diffusion potential in the presence of sodium ions was markedly diminished in the mutant cells. The membrane potential values of the wild-type and the mutant cells in the presence of 10 mM NaCl at pH 7. 0 were comparable at <b>energized</b> <b>conditions</b> (− 223 mV and − 230 mV respectively). The Mg 2 +-dependent ATPase activity of the 105 ×g supernatant of broken cells from the mutant cells was 30 % higher than in the wild-type. On the other hand, two bands with Mg 2 +-dependent ATPase activity were identified by native PAGE in this fraction in both wild-type as well as in mutant.

40|$|The proton {{motive force}} (PMF) was {{determined}} in Rhodobacter sphaeroides under anaerobic conditions {{in the dark and}} under aerobic-dark and anaerobic-light conditions. Anaerobically in the dark in potassium phosphate buffer, the PMF at pH 6 was - 20 mV and was composed of an electrical potential (delta psi) only. At pH 7. 9 the PMF was composed of a high delta psi of - 98 mV and was partially compensated by a reversed pH gradient (delta pH) of + 37 mV. ATPase inhibitors did not affect the delta psi, which was most likely the result of a K+ diffusion potential. Under <b>energized</b> <b>conditions</b> in the presence of K+ the delta psi depolarized due to electrogenic K+ uptake. This led to the generation of a delta pH (inside alkaline) in the external pH range of 6 to 8. This delta pH was dependent on the K+ concentration and was maximal at external K+ concentrations larger than 1. 2 mM. In energized cells in 50 mM KPi buffer containing 5 mM MgSO 4, a delta pH (inside alkaline) was present at external pHs from pH 6 to 8. As a result the overall magnitude of the PMF at various external pHs remained constant at - 130 mV, which was significantly higher than the PMF under anaerobic-dark conditions. In the absence of K+, in 50 mM NaPi buffer containing 5 mM MgSO 4, no depolarization of the delta psi was found and the PMF was composed of a large delta psi and a small delta pH. The delta pH became even reversed (inside acidic) at alkaline pHs (pH> 7. 3), resulting in a lowering of the PMF. These results demonstrate that in R. sphaeroides K+ uptake is essential for the generation of a delta pH and plays {{a central role in the}} regulation of the internal pH...|$|R

Subsequently, the lac carrier protein was extracted into octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and assayed for transport activity. Under all conditions tested, activity decreased as a single exponential function of radiation dosage, allowing straightforward application of target theory for determination of functional molecular mass. When lac carrier activity solubilized from nonenergized vesicles was assayed, the results obtained were consistent with a functional molecular size of 45 - 50 kDa, a value similar {{to the size of}} the protein as determined by other means. Similar values were obtained when the octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside extract was irradiated, and the target size observed for D-lactate dehydrogenase was in good agreement with the molecular size of this enzyme. Strikingly, when the same procedures were carried out with vesicles that were energized with appropriate electron donors prior to freezing and irradiation, a functional molecular size of 85 - 100 kDa was obtained for the lac carrier with no change in the target size of D-lactate dehydrogenase. In contrast, when the vesicles were <b>energized</b> under <b>conditions</b> in which the proton electrochemical gradient was collapsed, the target mass of the lac carrier returned to 45 - 50 kDa.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{fermentation}} {{for ethanol}} production, yeasts {{are subjected to}} different kinds of physico-chemical stresses such as: initially high sugar concentration and low temperature; and later, increased ethanol concentrations. Such conditions trigger a series of biological responses {{in an effort to}} maintain cell cycle progress and yeast cell viability. Regarding osmostress, many studies have been focused on transcriptional activation and gene expression in laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The overall aim of this present work was to further our understanding of wine yeast performance during fermentations under osmotic stress conditions. Specifically, the research work focused on the evaluation of NaCl-induced stress responses of an industrial wine yeast strain S. cerevisiae (VIN 13), particularly with regard to yeast cell growth and viability. The hypothesis was that osmostress <b>conditions</b> <b>energized</b> specific genes to enable yeast cells to survive under stressful conditions.

Subsequent fermentation cycles took place with increasing concentrations of D-glucose (20 %, 30 %, 40 % w/v) using salt-adapted cells as inocula.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to study the change in {{instantaneous}} values of the differential current in power transformer differential protection circuits under conditions of magnetizing inrush when the unloaded transformer is <b>energized</b> and under <b>conditions</b> of a fault within the protection zone. Saturation of measuring current transformers during the transient process leads to distortion of signals in their secondary windings, which can cause a long delay in the disconnection of the protected object and the development of an accident in the power system if traditional protective algorithms are used. Taking into account the peculiarities of the change in the instantaneous values of the differential current while developing the protection algorithm makes it possible to recognize faults with maximum speed before the moment of the first saturation of electromagnetic current transformers and thus avoid a delay in the operation of the protection. For quick and correct recognition of a fault within the protection zone authors proposed to monitor the maximum value of the derivative of the differential current and the duration of its monotonous change from the moment of the onset of the transient process. This is because the monitored parameters in the emergency and normal operation of the power transformer can vary significantly. Application of traditional protection algorithms together with proposed methods allows increasing the speed of differential protection response in different operation modes of the power system.

The delta pH and delta psi were determined from the transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled benzoate and tetraphenylphosphonium ions, respectively. Growth conditions of S. mutants Ingbritt were chosen so that the cells had a low apparent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) -dependent glucose:phosphotransferase activity. Cells <b>energized</b> under different <b>conditions</b> produced transmembrane proton potentials ranging from - 49 to - 103 mV but did not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose intracellularly. An artificial transmembrane proton potential was generated in deenergized cells by creating a delta psi with a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential and a delta pH by rapid acidification of the medium. Artificial transmembrane proton potentials up to - 83 mV, although producing proton influx, could not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose in deenergized cells or 2 -deoxyglucose or thiomethylgalactoside in deenergized, PEP-depleted cells. The transmembrane diffusion of glucose in PEP-depleted, KF-treated cells did not exhibit saturation kinetics or competitive inhibition by 6 -deoxyglucose or 2 -deoxyglucose, indicating that diffusion was not facilitated by a membrane carrier. As proton-linked membrane carriers {{have been shown to}} facilitate diffusion {{in the absence of a}} transmembrane proton potential, the results therefore are not consistent with a proton-linked glucose carrier in S. mutans Ingbritt.

40|$|Through the {{development}} and application of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based procedure for measuring the transport of complex organic molecules by vacuolar membrane vesicles in vitro, it is shown that the mechanism of uptake of sulfonylurea herbicides {{is determined by the}} ligand, glucose, or glutathione, to which the herbicide is conjugated. ATP-dependent accumulation of glucosylated chlorsulfuron by vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from red beet (Beta vulgaris) storage root approximates Michaelis-Menten kinetics and is strongly inhibited by agents that collapse or prevent the formation of a transmembrane H+ gradient, but is completely insensitive to the phosphoryl transition state analog, vanadate. In contrast, ATP-dependent accumulation of the glutathione conjugate of a chlorsulfuron analog, chlorimuron-ethyl, is incompletely inhibited by agents that dissipate the transmembrane H+ gradient but completely abolished by vanadate. In both cases, however, conjugation is essential for net uptake because neither of the unconjugated parent compounds are accumulated under <b>energized</b> or nonenergized <b>conditions.</b> That the attachment of glucose to two naturally occurring phenylpropanoids, p-hydroxycinnamic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid via aromatic hydroxyl groups, targets these compounds to the functional equivalent of the transporter responsible for chlorsulfuron-glucoside transport, confirms the general applicability of the H+ gradient dependence of glucoside uptake. It is concluded that H+ gradient-dependent, vanadate-insensitive glucoside uptake is mediated by an H+ antiporter, whereas vanadate-sensitive glutathione conjugate uptake is mediated by an ATP-binding cassette transporter. In so doing, it is established that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry affords a versatile high-sensitivity, high-fidelity technique for studies of the transport of complex organic molecules whose synthesis as radiolabeled derivatives is laborious and/or prohibitively expensive...|$|R

The space heating system comprises floor heaters, a water-to-water heat pump, and a ground heat exchanger. The PV system generates electricity that either may be consumed by the building or may be fed-in the electricity grid. The electricity grid is used as electricity storage. Three residential buildings are investigated. The first residential building has PVs that yearly produce smaller amount of electricity than the heating system requires. This is a negative-net energy building (NNEB). The second building has the PVs that produce the exact amount of electricity that the entire building annually needs. This is a zero-net energy building (ZNEB). The third building has PVs that entirely cover the south-facing roof of the building. This is a positive-net energy building (PNEB). These buildings are presented by a mathematical model, partially in an EnergyPlus environment. For all buildings, simulations by using EnergyPlus software would give the generated, consumed, and purchased energy with time step, and monthly and yearly values.
