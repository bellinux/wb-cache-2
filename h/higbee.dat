Three of the four Navy Crosses awarded to wartime Navy nurses were given posthumously to women who sacrificed their lives during the 1918 flu pandemic. The {{surviving}} fourth nurse was Lenah H.

The first Cincinnati–Chicago airmail flight took off from this field. On August 5, 1922, it was dedicated as Grisard Field, after Cincinnati-area pilot Lt. John K. Grisard, who was shot down in France during World War I. The following year, the Grisard Field Company leased the field to Maj. Hugh Watson, a barnstormer and former Army flight instructor, and his brother Parks. They were joined by John Paul Riddle and, in 1924, T. <b>Higbee</b> Embry. The company owned two Curtiss JN-4 biplanes. In its early days, the airfield's grass runways served general aviation, airmail operations, and the 359th Army Reserve Observation Squadron.|$|E

5000|$|The {{screenplay}} for A Christmas Story {{is based on}} material from author Jean Shepherd's collection of short stories, In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. The house, as it is portrayed in the film, is located in Hohman, Indiana, the fictional town modeled after Shepherd's native Hammond, Indiana. For the film adaptation of these stories, director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of <b>Higbee's</b> Department Store, which ultimately was featured in three scenes in the film. Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, {{the name of the}} actual street where Shepherd grew up. In addition to the house exteriors, Cleveland was the location used for the scenes involving <b>Higbee's</b> department store, despite {{the fact that there were}} no <b>Higbee's</b> stores in Shepherd's hometown. The exterior shots of the house and neighborhood where Ralphie lives were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side.|$|R

Brigham Young removed some participants including Haight and Lee from the LDS Church in 1870.

2500|$|The {{origins of}} Sheridan, which {{started out as}} Millwood, are vague, owing partly {{to the loss of}} all the town’s records in 1913 when a {{disastrous}} fire destroyed the town hall and many other buildings. [...] No documentation supports the popular contention that Egbert <b>Higbee</b> started the town in 1860. [...] <b>Higbee,</b> born in Ohio and brought to Adams Township as a child, did, indeed, lay out a town he called Millwood on land adjacent to the district school (built 1851) on the state road. [...] He had acquired his land in parcels and filed his town plat in April 1866. [...] Only two-and-a-half blocks divided into twenty lots, it was oriented in an east-west direction along {{the south side of the}} Lafayette-Noblesville state road, which <b>Higbee</b> designated as Main Street (present day Second Street; his “West Street” became Main). [...] <b>Higbee</b> immediately began to sell off lots to enterprising merchants and a few mill owners, and the little village got its start. [...] <b>Higbee</b> himself built a mill and laid out additions to his original plat. [...] Caswell Boxley, however, subdivided the south edge of his land, which adjoined Higbee’s plat across the state road and he laid out his own plat of Millwood immediately north and extending west of Higbee’s. [...] The initial town orientation was succeeded by one that placed Main Street in a north-south direction. [...] In a few years the hamlet of Millwood applied for a post office and was granted one on January 30, 1871. [...] Since there was already an existing post office in a village of the same name in Kosciusko County, this Millwood was rechristened “Sheridan,” in honor of Civil War general Philip Sheridan. [...] The town had something of an identity crisis for a few years as some people continued to call it Millwood while others used the new name of Sheridan—even in official records. [...] Its location on the state road connecting Noblesville and Lafayette was a good site for an agricultural center. [...] By this time other entrepreneurs had laid out additions to Millwood as well, but growth was slow until the coming of the Monon Railroad in 1882 which stimulated a commercial and industrial boom. [...] Several significant buildings from that early period survive, including the H.J. Thistlethwaite Building, constructed in 1886 to boast an opera house, a lodge room and retail spaces.|$|E

Taylor also alleged that Joseph Smith caught Bennett having sex with 21-year-old Francis M. <b>Higbee</b> though these interpretations of the accounts and the homosexual allegations against Bennett have been challenged.|$|E

50|$|Sterling Lindner Davis (SLD) {{was a major}} {{department}} store in downtown Cleveland's Theater District which operated from 1845 (with the founding of Sterling & Welch) to 1968. The retailer was primarily known for displaying the largest decorated Christmas tree {{in the state of}} Ohio, this tradition started in 1927. At their peak, Cleveland's {{department store}}s (May, <b>Higbee's,</b> Bailey's, Taylor's, Halle, and SLD or the big six) were one of the largest shopping districts in the United States. Before the explosive growth of Cleveland's suburban post World War II housing boom, people would flock to downtown's Euclid Avenue dressed in the finery of their Sunday best to shop in these huge stores that carried everything from clothing and jewelry to furniture and housewares. Though the idea of the largest tree in Cleveland is an attributed to <b>Higbee's</b> in A Christmas Story in 1983, the tradition was actually that of SLD, not <b>Higbee's,</b> which were in fact(along with May and Halle) huge rivals and constantly attempting to outdo each other in ever growing extravagance of merchandise and audacity of style.|$|R
