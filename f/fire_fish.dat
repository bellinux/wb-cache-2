50|$|The fish {{within the}} family Ptereleotridae have several names {{associated}} with them: dart fish, <b>fire</b> <b>fish,</b> and hover gobies because of their bright coloration, {{as well as their}} ability to hover just above the bottom of the reef, whereas most gobies are actually lying on the bottom most of the time. Some are called dart fish because when threatened or frightened, they quickly dart to a burrow beneath a rock or other structure. The Chinese zebra goby (Ptereleotris zebra) {{is an example of a}} fish from this family; Ptereleotris zebra can reach a maximum length of 12 cm and is usually found in and around reefs at depths from 2-31 m, but predominantly at 2-4 m. The native range of the Chinese zebra goby is in the Indonesian Pacific area, occupying the Great Barrier Reef, as well as the Red Sea and the Marshall Islands of Micronesia. This schooling species stays in groups and many can be found in the same refuge at once.|$|E
50|$|Emma and Dean are two high-school {{students}} on a class trip to Trinidad to build a school for less fortunate children and to explore the island. The two have little in common. During a boat party, Emma falls overboard when the party is interrupted by a police raid and Dean jumps into the water to save her. Dean then severs the rope attaching the dinghy to the party boat as he doesn't {{want to get into}} any more trouble than he already has. The pair drifts to a deserted island, avoiding dangerous rocks by using the one paddle in the dinghy. Back home, their parents have been alerted that the pair was last seen on the party boat, and the parents desperately search for them. Wondering if they will ever be rescued, Emma and Dean must rely on each other to survive. Together they learn to build a <b>fire,</b> <b>fish,</b> and find food. At first they are friends, but eventually their bond evolves into a romantic and intimate relationship. After being stranded for over 100 days, they are rescued by a tourist helicopter and taken back. They are met by family, friends, and the media. Emma is thrust back into a more popular position in school while Dean, still somewhat of an outcast, still longs for her. Adjusting back to their everyday lives, their relationship becomes somewhat strained and distant. Emma attends the prom, and Dean eventually decides to go as well after a little push by his father. At the prom, Emma spots Dean outside, watching her through the window as it's pouring rain on him. Emma goes out to meet him after encouragement from her best friend Lizzie. Emma and Dean kiss passionately and then dance together.|$|E

He's been brilliant for this football club and everyone at Fisher wishes Steve all the best with his future endeavours.' ...|$|R

40|$|Summer 2002 was {{a season}} of {{markedly}} increased wildfire in the southwestern United States. Four fires affected landscapes that encompassed watersheds and streams containing fishes. Streams affected {{in three of the}} four fires were sampled for multiple factors, including fishes, to delineate the impact of fires on aquatic ecosystems in the-Southwest. All fishes were lost in one stream, Ponil Creek, affected by the Ponil Complex fire. In two streams, Rio Medio and West Fork of the Gila River, 60 to 80 percent reductions in fish populations occurred following combinations of ash and flood flows. In 2002, information on <b>fires</b> effects on <b>fishes</b> was dramatically increased for mostly native, non-salmonid species of fishes. Results of these short-term studies suggest that the impacts of <b>fire</b> on <b>fishes</b> in lower order montane streams are extensive and negative.

25|$|Stephen and Stirling {{moved their}} {{divisions}} without incident, {{even though their}} troops were coming under fire from the enemy's light troops. De Borre somehow mismanaged the shift of Sullivan's division. Instead of simply moving to the right, the Frenchman ordered the division to file {{off to the left}} and circle back to the northeast. At the end of the bizarre maneuver, the 1st Brigade was in almost the same position it started. Instead of being alongside the 1st Brigade, the 2nd Brigade was behind it. At this moment, the crack Brigade of Guards supported by two 12-pound cannons attacked. When the sound of gunfire erupted, the confused soldiers of the 2nd Brigade volleyed into the backs of the 1st Brigade. The 1st Maryland Regiment put up some resistance, suffering 26 casualties, but the entire division soon crumbled. The soldiers headed to the rear pursued by the British Guards. De Borre later stated to Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland that a wound on his cheek was caused by the English <b>firing</b> <b>fish</b> hooks. Smith suspected that de Borre misrepresented his injury and that it was caused by riding through some briars. Since it led the column of march, Hazen's regiment apparently did not take part in de Borre's maneuver and instead joined Stirling's left flank.|$|R
