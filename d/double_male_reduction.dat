40|$|Female mate {{preference}} {{can have}} important fitness consequences for females through {{direct or indirect}} benefits of mate choice. However, the existence and benefits of mate choice in species that perform dissociated sperm transfer is largely unknown. In the springtail Orchesella cincta, receptive females locate and take up spermatophores deposited in the litter layer by males, without even meeting their partner. We investigated female sexual selection and its benefits in O. cincta. We performed female choice trials with manipulated spermatophore density and diversity to assess female preference for different spermatophore deposition patterns. Furthermore we tested whether females benefit from choosing between spermatophores by measuring several reproductive variables of females assigned to single male (no choice) and <b>double</b> <b>male</b> (choice) mating treatments. Our results show that females chose patches with four spermatophores over patches with a single spermatophore, but did not discriminate between patches of three spermatophores from a single male or from three different males. The mating experiment showed that O. cincta females gained indirect benefits from choosing between spermatophores of different males, because male offspring resulting from the <b>double</b> <b>male</b> treatment produced more spermatophores than the male offspring from females without a choice. No evidence was found for direct benefits of female choice, {{because there were no}} differences in clutch size, egg size or offspring survival between treatments. Despite the large number of studies on female mate choice, {{this is the first time}} that indirect benefits have been demonstrated in a species with dissociated sperm transfer. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There are few {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} and infection intensity of parasites in large samples of caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Therefore, differences related to sex, age, and season are unknown. The effect of parasites on the health and condition of caribou also is poorly known. From 1980 through 1987, 1258 barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus) were collected from the Beverly herd in north-central Canada. The prevalence in lungs of cysts of the hydatid tape-worm {Echinococcus granulosus) increased significantly with age of caribou. Prevalence in females was 2 % in the 2 - 5 year class and 8 % in older individuals. Cysts were more prevalent in young females compared with young <b>males.</b> <b>Reductions</b> in physical condition and fecundity were not statistically significant. The prevalence of Taenia hydatigena cysts in livers increased significantly with age of host but not with sex and condition of the hosts.

40|$|The Nur 77 /Nurr 1 {{family of}} DNA binding {{proteins}} {{has been reported}} to be required for the signal transduction of CD 3 /T cell receptor (TCR) - mediated apoptosis in T cell hybridomas. To determine the role of this family of DNA-binding proteins in thymic clonal deletion, transgenic (Tg) mice bearing a dominant negative mutation were produced. The transgene consisted of a truncated Nur 77 (deltaNur 77) gene encoding the DNA-binding domain of Nur 77 ligated to a TCR-beta enhancer resulting in early expression in thymocytes. Apoptosis of CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes mediated by CD 3 /TCR signaling was greatly inhibited in the deltaNur 77 Tg mice, compared with non-Tg littermates, after treatment with anti- CD 3 or anti-TCR antibody in vivo and in vitro. Clonal deletion of self- reactive T cells was investigated in deltaNur 77 -Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta double Tg mice. There was a five-fold increase in the total number of thymocytes expressing self-reactive Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta in the deltaNur 77 -TCR-alpha/beta <b>double</b> Tg <b>male</b> mice. Deficient clonal deletion of self-reactive thymocytes was demonstrated by a 10 -fold increase in the CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes that expressed Tg TCR-alpha/beta. There was an eightfold increase in the CD 8 +, Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta T cells in the lymph nodes (LN) of delta Nur 77 -Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta double Tg compared with Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta Tg male mice. In spite of defective clonal deletion, the T cells expressing the Tg TCR were functionally anergic. In vivo analysis revealed increased activation and apoptosis of T cells associated with increased expression of Fas and Fas ligand in LN of deltaNur 77 -Db/HY TCR-alpha/beta <b>double</b> <b>male</b> mice. These results indicate that inhibition of Nur 77 /Nurr 1 DNA binding in T cells leads to inefficient thymic clonal deletion, but T cell tolerance is maintained by Fas-dependent clonal deletion in LN and spleen...|$|R

40|$|Formation and {{expression}} of memories {{are critical for}} context-dependent decision making. In Drosophila, a courting male rejected by a mated female subsequently courts less avidly when paired with a virgin female, a behavioral modification attributed to “courtship memory. ” Here we show the critical role of hormonal state for maintenance of courtship memory. Ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) is essential for courtship memory through regulation of juvenile hormone (JH) levels in adult <b>males.</b> <b>Reduction</b> of JH levels via silencing of ETH signaling genes impairs short-term courtship memory, a phenotype rescuable by the JH analog methoprene. JH-deficit-induced memory impairment involves rapid decay rather than failure of memory acquisition. A critical period governs memory performance during the first 3 days of adulthood. Using sex-peptide-expressing “pseudo-mated” trainers, we find that robust courtship memory elicited {{in the absence of}} aversive chemical mating cues also is dependent on ETH-JH signaling. Finally, we find that JH acts through dopaminergic neurons and conclude that an ETH-JH-dopamine signaling cascade is required during a critical period for promotion of social-context-dependent memory...|$|R
5000|$|The California sheephead is {{considered}} a vulnerable species because of its high fishing rates off of the coast of Southern California. [...] Usually most of the fish caught are the largest males, causing a shortage in males in the population and the subsequent morphogenesis of the largest females to males. [...] This, in turn, creates a deficiency {{in the number of}} eggs produced and weakens the population in a particular fishing area. [...] Male numbers seem typically low which also could result in sperm limitation for the species, with further <b>male</b> <b>reduction,</b> resulting in reduced reproductive output: males are readily targeted in the recreational spear fishery. [...] Commercial and recreational fishing pressure has increased (there is also an artisanal sector), and this has caused catches to decline over the last decade. [...] To control the catches of sheephead and prevent overfishing, the California Department of Fish and Game in 2001 established regulations that restrict the catch size of sheephead and the areas where these fish may be caught.|$|R
