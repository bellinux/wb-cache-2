40|$|Abstract only availableA nuclear {{decapping}} and binding protein, X 29 /Nudt 16, {{was originally}} characterized in Xenopus, {{and has also}} been characterized in humans. It is suggested that not only the protein's sequence, but also its functions has been preserved through evolution. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize a homologue of Nudt 16 in the <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark,</b> which on an evolutionary scale is quite diverged from frogs and mammals. Here the open reading frame encoding the <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein was amplified via PCR and cloned into an expression vector. When placed into bacteria under the proper growth conditions, a Histidine-tagged <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein is synthesized. The protein can be purified from bacteria. The purified <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein will be tested to determine if it has the same biochemical properties as the mammalian and frog proteins: can the protein decap RNA in vitro and can it bind RNA directly. Does this protein have catalytic activity that is essential for a healthy life?NSF grant to B. Peculus, NSF-REU Program in Biological Sciences & Biochemistr...|$|R

40|$|The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -barrier (CSFB) {{is formed}} by the Choroid Plexūs (CP). Together with the blood brain barrier it {{represents}} an important barrier between brain and circulating blood. Since {{it can only be}} passed by small, lipid-soluble and uncharged molecules it is of particular interest to study active transport processes for charged substances across this tissue, especially because many drugs are substrates for these transport proteins. Transporters in the CP are similar to those in the kidney. Therefore, I performed comparative experiments with model organic anions in isolated proximal kidney tubules of killfish and CP of rat and spiny <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark.</b> ·First, I studied transport of the fluorescent cAMP analog fluo-cAMP. Inhibition studies indicate transport mediated by the export proteins Mrp 2 and Mrp 4. In contrast to transport of the Mrp 2 -substrate fluorescein-methotrexate (FL-MTX), transport is not regulated by proteinkinase (PK) A, and PKC. For better characterization of kinetic parameters I studied transport of fluo-cAMP in membrane vesicles of MRP 2 and MRP 4 overexpressing cells. Both MRPs transported fluo-cAMP with similar affinites. Different from results obtained from experiments using renal proximale tubules, fluo-cAMP transport in CP seems not to be mediated by Mrp 4, whereas a participation of Mrp 1 is likely. Regulation of fluo-cAMP transport in rat CP is not mediated by PKA, PKC or mitogen activated PK (MAPK). ·Transport of Texas Red (TR) and FL-MTX was studied in CP of rat and spiny <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark.</b> Transport of TR across rat CP is a two-step mechanism, which is metabolism-driven, Na+-dependent, potential independent and also independent from Mrp 1, Mrp 2 and Mrp 4. In <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> CP TR transport is Na+-independent, with apical uptake apparently mediated by an Oat-protein, whereas basolateral efflux seems to be mediated by Oatp 2 and Mrp 1. ·Apical uptake of FL-MTX in rat CP is also Na+-independent with an potential independent basolateral efflux, which is presumably mediated via Mrp 1 and Oatp 2. Activation of PKA results in an activation of FL-MTX efflux. In <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> FL-MTX is transported via the same transport proteins. But in contrast to rat CP, activation of PKA results in a reduced efflux of FL-MTX, whereas activation of PKC leads to a downregulation of FL-MTX transport...|$|R
