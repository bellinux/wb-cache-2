These occur in no less than fifty-five different genera, belonging to twenty-four natural orders, and in thirty-two of these genera the normal flowers are irregular, and have therefore been specially modified for insect fertilisation.[152] These flowers appear to be degradations of the normal flowers, and are closed up by various modifications of the petals or other parts, {{so that it is}} impossible for insects to reach the interior, yet they produce seed in abundance, and are often the chief means by which the species is continued. Thus, in our common dog-violet the perfect flowers rarely produce seed, while the rudimentary cleistogamic flowers do so in abundance. The sweet violet also produces abundance of seed from its cleistogamic flowers, and few from its perfect flowers; but in Liguria it produces only perfect flowers which seed abundantly. No case appears to be known of a plant which has cleistogamic flowers only, but a small rush (Juncus bufonius) is in this condition in some parts of Russia, while in other parts perfect flowers are also produced.[153] Our common <b>henbit</b> <b>dead-nettle</b> (Lamium amplexicaule) produces cleistogamic flowers, as do also some orchids. The advantage gained by the plant is great economy of specialised material, since with very small flowers and very little expenditure of pollen an abundance of seed is produced.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Chemicals {{are being}} sought that can control weeds in lettuce under {{different}} environmental conditions, soil types and weed populations. The extensive or repeated {{use of a}} herbicide may lead to important changes in the weed population which call for new materials that {{can take care of}} the modified situation. In the search for new chemicals, RH 315 has appeared promising in some respects. Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine the tolerance of lettuce (crisphead type) to RH 315 in three types of soil. Its performance on weeds under different environmental conditions, its residual action on other vegetables, as well as pre and postemergence activity on weeds were also tested. Other herbicides were used in some experiments. Lettuce of the crisphead type proved to possess high tolerance to RH 315. The tolerance was greater in a silty clay loam and a muck soil than in a sandy soil. In all types of soil, the safety factor was greater than 2 X when susceptible weeds are considered. The degree of tolerance varied with the season in field experiments. RH 315 at 1. 5 to 2 lb/A in a silty clay loam and at 1 to 1. 5 lb/A in a sandy loam provided excellent control of annual bluegrass, Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, green foxtail, common chickweed, purslane, mouseear chickweed, lambsquarters, <b>henbit,</b> red <b>dead-nettle,</b> shepherspurse and bittercress. The control of pigweed and wild mustard required higher rates. No control of composite species was achieved with this compound. Delaying sprinkler irrigation after application caused reduction in RH 315 activity. It was more effective in controlling weeds in early fall than during the summer. Two months after application, RH 315 residues from rates which were effective in controlling susceptible weeds did not cause injury to bush beans, sweet corn, cucumbers, red beets, common chickweed and annual bluegrass, under summer conditions. When applied at the stage of two true leaves or before, under conditions of early fall, RH 315 proved to possess postemergence activity on weed species that are controlled by preemergence applications of this compound. From 17 to 2 O days were required for RH 315 to exert its effect in postemergence application. Trifluralin at 0. 75 lb/A provided excellent control of Italian ryegrass, barnyardgrass, pigweed and purslane both in a silty clay loam and a sandy loam. Benefin and EL 179 both at 1 lb/A gave good control of the same weeds in the silty clay loam, but their performance was inferior to that of trifluralin. Benefin at 0. 75 lb/A did not perform very well in the sandy loam. Delaying incorporation 68 hours after the herbicide application caused 70...|$|R

50|$|<b>Henbit</b> <b>dead-nettle</b> is {{probably}} {{native to the}} Mediterranean region but has spread {{around the world as}} an arable weed. It is found growing in bare places, gardens, fields and waste places. It propagates freely by seed and is regarded as a minor weed. Sometimes entire fields will be reddish-purple with its flowers before spring ploughing. Where common, it is an important nectar and pollen plant for bees, especially honeybees, where it helps start the spring build up.|$|E
50|$|<b>Henbit</b> <b>dead-nettle</b> is {{an annual}} herb with a {{sprawling}} habit and short erect squarish, lightly hairy stems. It grows to {{a height of}} about 10 to 30 cm. The leaves are in opposite pairs, often with long internodes. The lower leaves are stalked and the upper ones stalkless, often fused, and clasping the stems. The blades are hairy and kidney-shaped, with rounded teeth. The flowers are relatively large and form a few-flowered terminal spike with axillary whorls. The calyx is regular with five lobes and closes up after flowering. The corolla is purplish-red, fused into a tube 15 to 20 mm long. The upper lip is convex, 3 to 5 mm long and the lower lip has three lobes, two small side ones and a larger central one 1.5 to 2.5 mm long. There are four stamens, two long and two short. The gynoecium has two fused carpels and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp.|$|E
