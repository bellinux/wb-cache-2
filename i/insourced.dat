5000|$|Further, {{the label}} {{outsourcing}} {{has been found}} to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not <b>insourced,</b> are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed [...] "remote in-sourcing." [...] Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} outsourced intermediate goods, together with capital, labor, and <b>insourced</b> intermediate products, as inputs in Spain's motor vehicle production. Its {{findings are consistent with}} statistically significant economies of scale. Capital and labor are found to be substitutes, as are most of the other input pairs. However, capital and outsourced intermediate goods and labor and <b>insourced</b> intermediate goods appear to have complementary relationships, and the latter relationship has become stronger over the period of study. Any actions that decrease the price of one of the inputs in a complementary pair will increase the demand for the other input. Since labor and outsourced intermediate goods appear to be substitutes, a decrease in import prices as a result of further European integration will decrease the demand for domestic labor and exacerbate Spain's unemployment problem.

The paper also seeks to gain a full perspective of the differing employee attitudes towards the outsourcing strategy. Firstly, secondary research {{was carried out in}} order to define the term “outsourcing” and to recognize the pros and cons that the outsourcing strategy can have on an organisation and especially, the hotel industry. Following this, primary research was conducted which focused on the experiences and opinions from both <b>insourced</b> and outsourced employees as well as managers in regards to outsourcing within the Splendid Hospitality Group. A qualitative research method was used where six semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted which involved two <b>insourced</b> employees, two outsourced employees as well as two managers of the Splendid Hospitality Group. The data was later transcribed from recordings which were then manually coded where the researcher identified main themes. The themes included the reason to outsource, job performance, conflict between <b>insourced</b> and outsourced employees and the benefits of outsourcing. Moreover, the data was critically discussed which gave an insight into how outsourcing is affecting job satisfaction and the impact this has on a hotel as an organisation within a competitive market. Interestingly, {{all but one of the}} interviewees agreed that outsourcing only impacts negatively on a hotel which has resulted in these participants experiencing challenges such as poor job performance and communication barriers between departments. Moreover, both outsourced employees confirmed feelings of dissatisfaction within their employment which further added to the poor performance of the SHG hotels. Therefore, a set of recommendations were applied where the Splendid Hospitality Group can continue using the outsourcing strategy in a way that will allow job satisfaction amongst employees in order to prevent danger to the organisation’s reputation...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{empirical}} data to compare large-scale agile method tailoring in {{two types of}} global software development programme: offshore outsourced services and offshore captive development centres. This research forms {{part of a larger}} study and uses data collected from face-to-face semi-structured open-ended interviews with over 50 practitioners in 9 international companies selected using a snowball sampling technique. Analysis has been conducted using 'Glaserian' grounded theory concepts, including open coding, memoing, constant comparison and theoretical saturation. The contribution of the paper is to present a novel classification model contrasting solution focused development, where offshore organisations deliver a complete solution, and execution focused development, where offshore organisations implement work packages defined by the client. The research has discovered evidence of solution and execution focused models used by outsourced service providers. In addition, evidence is presented of solution and execution focused models used by <b>insourced</b> offshore development centres. The classification model contrasts offshore project management with offshore management disintermediation, where staff from offshore organisations are directly managed by onshore client staff. Product ownership is commonly located onshore, but here too, counter examples of offshore product ownership have been found in outsourced service providers and <b>insourced</b> offshore development centres...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to {{understand}} how manufacturing flexibility impacts an <b>insourcing</b> process. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a case study of an <b>insourcing</b> process, covering a factory shutdown in Holland and the transfer of production of pumps to Sweden. Analysis of manufacturing flexibility was based on Koste and Malhotra’s (1999) ten dimensions. Findings The findings show that there is a linkage between the efficiency of the <b>insourcing</b> process and manufacturing flexibility. Through studying the <b>insourcing</b> process, the importance of the flexibility of other parts of the production network became evident. As focusing on the manufacturing flexibility of a production network it was seen that the new product and modification flexibility dimensions should not be on the plant level in the manufacturing flexibility hierarchy. Instead a new level in the manufacturing flexibility hierarchy should be introduced, the production network level, where new product and modification flexibility belong. Further, in order to capture the flexibility in transferring knowledge and technology as well as the start-up of production, an additional manufacturing flexibility dimension should be added, transfer flexibility. Practical implications To identify and adjust areas with low manufacturing flexibility hampering the <b>insourcing</b> process, practitioners can use the model with the added dimension before initiating an <b>insourcing</b> process. What is original/value of paper The paper contributes to an increased understanding of problems relating to <b>insourcing</b> and how these relate to the flexibility of the flexibility of the whole production network...|$|R

40|$|Background: Companies {{have often}} relinquished {{the control of}} {{important}} business functions to outside suppliers {{for the sake of}} short-term savings and {{because of the lack of}} use of proper decision-making methods within the business. Objectives: This article identified three methods of decision-making and applied it to a logistics outsourcing problem. The logistics outsourcing problem consisted of a make-or-buy decision as well as a supplier selection process. The purpose of the study was to determine the most suitable method in the case of logistics outsourcing. Method: The decision-making methods were applied to a South African case study within the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The logistics functions considered in the case study included secondary distribution and warehousing of finished goods. Each method considered the same evaluation criteria and the results were analysed and compared. Results: Each method produced different results to the logistics outsourcing problem. The method developed by Platts, Probert and Canez (2000) suggested that the logistics functions be <b>insourced.</b> The decision tree method suggested outsourcing both functions, with a unit rate cost model. The results from the linear programming (LP) method indicated that the secondary distribution function should be <b>insourced</b> and the warehousing function outsourced, with a fixed and variable cost model pending further analysis of the demand trends. Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that proven outsourcing decision-making methods, such as the method developed by Platts et al. (2000), the LP method and the decision tree method traditionally applied to a manufacturing outsourcing decision problem, can be adapted and applied to a logistics outsourcing decision problem of a South African FMCG company. </div...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of firm {{heterogeneity}} and information spillovers in the sourcing decision to provide web services.

Using our estimated model, we investigate why <b>insourcing</b> of web services is much more prevalent than outsourcing. We find that <b>insourcing</b> is likely to generate the higher value for most firms, and lack {{of information on the}} ecacy of outsourcing is unlikely to account for the dominance of <b>insourcing</b> over outsourcing. Therefore, differences in firm choices with regard to web services provision is primarily driven by firm heterogeneity, rather than by information spillovers. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Insourcing</b> and {{vertical}} integration often allow companies to gain competitive advantage by exercising {{a greater degree}} of control over their supply chain. In the case of ABC Oilfield Services, <b>insourcing</b> the transportation of their products to offshore oil rigs at sea - a function currently provided by their customers - will increase asset velocity of their most important tools, and allow them to service more customers with fewer tools. This is an especially important consideration {{in light of the fact}} that the offshore drilling market will see double-digit growth in the coming years. This paper examines the effect of such increased asset velocity on Return on Assets (ROA). Using detailed historical data of ABC shipments of their biggest revenue-generating tools, we modeled both the status quo logistics system of ABC, and an alternative system based on sound <b>insourcing</b> assumptions. We then compared the projected ROA of the two scenarios in order to gain insights into the relationship between <b>insourcing</b> and its likely effect on ROA. We attempt to quantify the asset velocity benefits of <b>insourcing,</b> but also show the surprising result that increased asset velocity can have a negative effect on revenue under common pricing schemes. While there may be several other factors which help in ultimately making the decision to <b>insource,</b> the paper provides an important contribution in helping decision makers see the effects of <b>insourcing</b> in the oilfield services industry more clearly, and identifying the conditions under which <b>insourcing</b> will have the biggest benefit to ROA. by Devjit Ghose and Kevin Murphy.

A configuration is a system description that indicates which processes are to be <b>insourced</b> and which outsourced; even a fairly modest e-business can involve many different possible configurations. To decide which configuration to adopt a systematic process is required to measure how risk varies between configurations. This paper develops a modelling method based around five possible defective outputs of a business process. Four types of risk and four approaches to model parameter estimation are considered within the model. The model is applied to a simple example of a company selling physical goods over the Internet. It is shown how the model outputs can provide useful pointers to process redesign and issues to be considered during outsourcing contract negotiations. ...|$|E
