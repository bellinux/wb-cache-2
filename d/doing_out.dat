500|$|On February 4, {{against the}} New Jersey Nets and All-Star guard Deron Williams, Lin had 25points, fiverebounds, and sevenassists—all career highs—in a 99–92 Knicks victory. Teammate Carmelo Anthony {{suggested}} to coach Mike D'Antoni at halftime that Lin should play {{more in the}} second half. After the game, D'Antoni said Lin had a point-guard mentality and [...] "a rhyme and a reason for what he is <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> there". In the subsequent game against the Utah Jazz, Lin made his first career start playing without stars Anthony, who left the game due to injury, and Amar'e Stoudemire, whose older brother had died. Lin had 28points and eightassists in the Knicks' 99–88 win. Stoudemire and Anthony missed the next three and seven games, respectively. D'Antoni stated after the Jazz game {{that he intended to}} ride Lin [...] "like freakin' Secretariat". Basketball trainer David Thorpe said in hindsight that such a statement of confidence so soon by a coach was [...] "incredibly rare", and likely gave Lin the confidence to continue to play aggressively despite making mistakes.|$|E

[...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E

2500|$|On April 11, 1974, Coleman lost {{a bid for}} {{a no-hitter}} {{in the eighth inning}} when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. [...] By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and {{appeared}} to be on track for the best season of his career. [...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange. [...] My arm felt better than it ever had before in my life. But I couldn't do it. [...] It {{was just one of those}} crazy things.
