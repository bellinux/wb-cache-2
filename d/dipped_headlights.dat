5000|$|The smaller-engined Snipe was discontinued. Early Mark II Super Snipes can be {{distinguished}} by round lamps below the head lamps.The left one was a fog lamp, and the right one was a [...] "pass" [...] lamp with a low narrow beam for passing cars when using <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights.</b> These were dropped in 1949 in favour of rectangular side lamps which were continued in the Mark III.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new fuel}} {{injection}} system was introduced for the 2002 year, which worked like a carburetor by employing a CV carburetor slide controlled by vacuum created by the engine. With a similar power output to the 2000-2001 bike, the engine remained largely the same. One notable improvement {{was the use of}} new cylinder sleeves of a high silicon content alloy containing magnesium that minimized heat induced distortion, reducing oil consumption. Also in 2002, Yamaha released the newly developed [...] "Deltabox III" [...] frame, which, with its hydro formed construction, reduced the total number of frame welds. These changes improved the frame's rigidity by 30%. The cooling system was redesigned for better performance and compactness. The exhaust system was changed from a 4-into-1 to a new titanium 4-into-2-into-1 design. The rear end of the motorcycle was updated and streamlined with a LED taillight. This allowed for very clean rear body lines when choosing one of several common after market modifications, such as removal of the turn signal stalks and stock license plate bracket; and replacing them with assorted available replacements that [...] "hug" [...] the body or frame. Also, front end lighting was improved in 2002, between the higher definition headlights and also side [...] "parking" [...] lights within the twin-headlight panel, giving a more angular appearance. This also gave additional after market possibilities, such as to remove the front turn signals and use these front lights as directional or hazard markers while stopped. For 2003, the only change was fitted hazard warning lights and <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights,</b> which stay on all the time the engine is running.|$|E

Similarities and differences in opinions of the participating institutes were presented in this report. In this respect, attention is paid to different aspects, such as: (1) the magnitude of the effect of DRL to be expected; (2) the position of slow traffic: cyclists and pedestrians; (3) the relation between rear end collisions and DRL; (4) the position of motorcyclists: (5) visual hindrance; (6) defective lighting and DRL; (7) <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights</b> or warning lights; and (8) compulsory use versus recommended DRL...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{documented the}} frequency of protective and risky motorcycling opinions and behaviours and investigated whether these opinions and behaviours were more frequently expressed by licensed than unlicensed riders and by riders with high rather than low exposure to motorcycling. Areas where there was scope for improvement were identified to help guide the promotion of protective strategies. As {{part of a broader}} study of a birth cohort, 217 18 year old motorcyclists were administered a motorcycling computer questionnaire. Evidence of positive protective opinions was found, but there was considerable scope for behavioural improvements. While 92 % had worn a helmet, optimal protection was reported less frequently for other body areas: most often for the feet (54 %), hands (47 %) and upper body (35 %) and least often for the legs (8 %). Most (87 %) riders considered conspicuity increased safety, 68 % favoured mandatory day-time headlight use, and 66 % used <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights</b> in day-time. While 55 % favoured mandatory wearing of high-visibility clothing, only 15 % of day-time and 20 % of night-time riders reported doing this. During the past month, 16 % had driven within two hours of drinking alcohol and 6 % when too tired to be fully in control. Overall, 22 % had been penalized for a motorcycle driving offence, most often speeding. While 46 % said they agreed with the Graduated Driver Licensing System (GDLS), most licensed under that system reported breaking licence conditions and most were not apprehended. Licensed motorcyclists were significantly more likely than the unlicensed to favour mandatory day-time headlight usage, report using <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights</b> in day-time, and wear better protection for the head, upper body and hands, but {{were also more likely to}} report drinking and driving and traffic convictions [...] probably because of their greater exposure. Other, non-significant, results were in the same direction, except that fewer licensed than unlicensed riders were in favour of mandatory high visibility clothing or the GDLS. A similar pattern of more protective attitudes and behaviours was found for high rather than low exposure riders, though it was generally weaker, and high exposure was associated with drinking and driving, driving while tired and traffic convictions. The issues of representativeness and reliability are discussed and some implications for public policies towards motorcycling by young people are considered. Further research is recommended in order to determine which are the best predictors of motorcycling opinions and behaviours: personal characteristics, the formal training associated with licensure, or exposure to motorcycling. motorcycling protective opinions protective behaviours risky behaviours graduated driver licensing adolescence...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{the last part of}} the {{documentation}} of a project funded by the European Commission, designed to assess the effects of Daytime Running Lights (DRL) and possible strategies for implementing the use of DRL in the European Union (EU). The general objective of the present report is to produce implementation scenarios for DRL in the EU, as well as further specific recommendations for implementation that would maximize the positive effects, while minimizing the negative effects. The report starts off by summarizing the results of previous work done in this project. First, the results of a meta-analysis of 41 evaluation studies of the effects of DRL on road safety are presented. The main conclusions of the metaanalysis are that, given the evidence provided by the evaluation studies, the use of DRL is associated with a reduction in multi-party daytime accidents, and that it is likely that DRL have a favourable effect on accidents involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Then, the results of an experimental study on the possible adverse effects of DRL on vulnerable road users are discussed. The conclusion from this study is that no evidence was found of a reduced conspicuity of vulnerable road users in the vicinity of a vehicle using DRL. Next, an overview of possible DRL implementation scenarios for the EU is presented, as well as of arguments against DRL, and of expected acceptance levels of these scenarios, based on a survey that was conducted in countries that already have DRL legislation, and in other countries of the EU. The main conclusions of this survey are that most of the opposition against DRL greatly subsided in countries after DRL legislation was implemented, and that most DRL countries used a gradual approach to the implementation of DRL. As concerns the results of the survey for non-DRL member states of the EU, it is concluded that the installation of automatic dedicated DRL on new cars should be made at least part of the DRL implementation scenarios to be developed for the EU. Finally, the results of a cost-benefit analysis of five policy options for the implementation of DRL in the EU are presented and discussed, and it is concluded that the policy option with the second best benefit-cost ratio is likely to yield the largest acceptance. This policy option consists of the mandatory use of <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights</b> as DRL for the current car stock, together with the installation of automatic dedicated DRL in accordance with ECE- 87 regulations on new cars, both to be implemented at the same time from a certain date onwards, and preceded by a period of recommended DRL usage combined with a large-scale publicity campaign. Should the technical part of the implementation take too long, however, the report recommends to start imposing the use of <b>dipped</b> <b>headlights</b> as DRL as soon as possible, thus avoiding an unnecessary delay in the expected road safety benefits of DRL...|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} August 1933 all Morris {{cars had}} {{synchromesh}} four-speed gearboxes, <b>dipping</b> <b>headlights,</b> hydraulic shock absorbers, leather upholstery, hydraulic brakes, rear petrol tank, direction indicators and safety glass. The Family Saloon and Minor added to that illuminated direction indicators and pneumatic upholstery.The £100 car suffered a price rise in August 1933.|$|R
50|$|Announced 28 August 1933 the 1934 Cowley Six {{replaced}} the Morris Major keeping the same 1938 cc six cylinder, side valve engine {{but with a}} new lower chassis. Along with all other Morris cars the Cowley now has a syncromesh four-speed gearbox, <b>dipping</b> <b>headlights,</b> hydraulic shock absorbers, leather upholstery, hydraulic brakes, rear petrol tank, direction indicators, safety glass, battery master switches and automatic ignition. There was a matching smaller 12 hp 1378 cc Morris Ten Six.|$|R
5000|$|The Alexander TS {{also came}} with a {{completely}} redesigned back axle, which significantly improved the car's handling, and anticipated the rear-suspension configuration on the Lloyd Arabella (which appeared in Lloyd showrooms the next year). [...] The rear axle was attached using semi-trailing arms (generally identified in contemporary sources simply as [...] "trailing arms") with [...] "progressively acting" [...] coil springs. The TS also incorporated detailed enhancements such as the windscreen washer system and, new for 1957, asymmetrically <b>dipping</b> <b>headlight</b> beams.|$|R
5000|$|Electrical {{fittings}} now {{included a}} single acting foot-operated switch to <b>dip</b> the <b>headlights</b> and raise them when pressed again. A single {{electric windscreen wiper}} mounted on the lower screen rail was supplied to provide clear forward vision in poor weather ...|$|R
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, <b>headlight</b> <b>dipping,</b> <b>headlight</b> flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk. This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted {{by any of the}} “big three" [...] manufacturers, the other two being Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's.|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{tested the}} fabric bodied {{version of the}} new car. The driver has been given an {{electrical}} petrol gauge. Standard fitments include: bumpers, a stoplight and <b>dipping</b> <b>headlights</b> pneumatically controlled from the steering wheel. The four-wheel brakes are Lockheed hydraulic. The rear brakes by hand {{were found to be}} [...] "useful" [...] and the pedal brakes [...] "admirable". Tools are supplied in a locker under the near side running board. The battery can be got at through a trap under the driver's seat. At the rear there is a fair-sized lockable luggage compartment. [...] "The minimum brake horsepower is stated to be 45 at 3,200 rpm." [...] Frame members are straight and at bumper height so that any shock is better withstood.|$|R
50|$|The X-PERIENCE {{comes with}} Driving Assistance systems, {{including}} Front Assist, which monitors the traffic situation {{in front of}} your vehicle, High Beam Assist, which automatically <b>dips</b> your <b>headlights</b> for oncoming traffic and Lane Assist, a technology that helps drivers to avoid drifting out of their lanes. The Tiredness Recognition System detects tiredness and uses an alert notification to advise the driver when to take a break.|$|R
50|$|Following {{two years}} of {{production}} improvements were introduced in September 1927 for that year's motor show. The wheelbase was lengthened by 2 in but not the car's overall length. The steering was improved for a smoother and lighter action and the column rake was now adjustable. The front brake cables were replaced with rods. The engine received larger crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and an anti-detonating ("anti-knock") design adopted for the cylinder head. A Weymann fabric bodied 4-light 4-door sports saloon (as chosen for personal use by Henry Segrave) with safety glass option and a 6-light Safety saloon (fitted with Triplex safety glass) joined the range. The artillery wheel option was dropped. <b>Dipping</b> <b>headlights</b> were a new feature. Separate seats replaced the front bench seat and both back and front seats were widened. There were also changes to the mudguards and running boards. The export car was widened to 67 in inches and its track to 56 in inches. A water-impeller and a large top radiator tank were also fitted to export cars.|$|R
40|$|This report firstly {{offers an}} {{overview}} of observation in vehicle lighting. To see and be seen are important considerations in this regard. The paper describes the function and types of application of the front <b>dipped</b> <b>headlight.</b> Subsequently, the technical lighting aspects of high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps which have an influence on road safety are described. Due to the intense light produced by HID lamps {{and the presence of}} ultraviolet (UV) radiation, two possible areas of application are described: (1) polarised light and (2) the use of fluorescent material to enhance the visibility of objects. The health hazard presented by UV radiation is not ignored, however. The light emission of a dipped light beam as stipulated by ECE regulation R 20 is dealt with extensively. The paper also presents the results of study into HID lamps in the United States and European research through EUREKA 'VEDELIS'. It is concluded that: (i) the proposed light emission of the dipped light beam for HID lamps is higher than the current ECE standard for virtually all measurement parameters; and (ii) the orientation of the light beam emission should pay greater attention to the position of vulnerable road users...|$|R

5000|$|A {{range of}} four petrol/gasoline, and two diesel engines {{offering}} maximum power outputs ranging from 75-122 PS (55-90 kW; 74-120 bhp) {{is the same}} as in the Rapid. [...] The same counts for the equipment. With launch of the Spaceback, the European Rapid models were given optional low power <b>dipped</b> beam xenon <b>headlights.</b> Due to the high intensity of xenon lamps, by law, if xenon headlights are fitted, headlight washers and dynamic headlight range adjustment must also be used.|$|R
5000|$|There was a 12-volt {{electrical}} system for lighting and starting. Timing {{was at the}} back of the engine. From there on the off-side were driven in-line the generator, water-pump and magneto. Reported refinements for the 1929 Motor Show included: chromium-plated exterior fittings, Triplex glass, improved (dome type) [...] "mud wings (front mudguards) and new gas (sic) and ignition control levers [...] "neatly placed above the steering wheel". For 1930 the specification included Biflex magnetic <b>dip</b> and switch <b>headlights</b> and wire wheels.|$|R
2500|$|A second {{interim report}} was {{released}} on 20 February 2017. In April 2017, {{it was reported that}} there had been three cases of speeding on the section of line which included the accident site in the period November 2016 – April 2017. In one case, a tram was reported to be doing [...] in a [...] zone. Within the second interim report the RAIB notes that drivers of trams approaching the curve can be expected to sight the curve and the speed restriction sign from 90 meters with full beam headlights on and 60 meters with <b>dipped</b> beam <b>headlights.</b> Although the report states that the tram's braking system was not capable of slowing the tram sufficiently between the point where the speed restriction sign became visible and {{the point at which the}} speed restriction is enforced it also says [...] "There was no sign to indicate to drivers where they should begin to apply the brake for the Sandilands curve; they were expected to know this from their knowledge of the route." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} other minor {{alterations}} followed, including fuel-injected engines to meet emissions regulations in export markets. On the earlier Samaras the front clip had been a separate piece, surrounding the headlights. On the sedan version, the fenders {{go all the way}} up to the headlights and the lip of the bonnet <b>dips</b> between the <b>headlights</b> and meets the slimmer grille. Full production of the 21099 began in December 1990, with models 210993 (1288), 21099 (1499). The saloon, intended as a premium model compared to the hatchback, was given a distinctive branding in some export markets: Diva (Belgium), Sagona (France), Forma (Germany). Belgium also offered a locally built convertible. The 1.1 and 1.3 were eventually taken out of production, having already been withdrawn from export markets.|$|R
2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted <b>headlight</b> <b>dip</b> switch, and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|R
500|$|Waddington {{had success}} in other sports, {{especially}} {{as an amateur}} football goalkeeper. He was with Bradford City in the 1920–21 football season, but did not play a match for them. For the 1921–22 season, he played for Halifax Town, making seven appearances in the Football League. He was a good enough golfer to represent Yorkshire, to partner Henry Cotton, and {{to play in the}} qualifying rounds of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1939. Sutcliffe wrote that leading golfers told him that had Waddington not been a cricketer, he had the talent to have succeeded as a golfer, although he was prone to carelessness in his play. One Bradford golf club banned him after he poured a glass of beer over the captain, who Waddington believed had used inappropriate language in front of a woman. A motorcycling enthusiast, he regularly attended the Isle of Man TT, although his love of fast cars brought him trouble from the police at times. [...] After one incident in 1938, he was fined £5 for assaulting a policeman and using obscene language after being asked to <b>dip</b> his <b>headlights.</b> In 1950, he was fined and banned from driving for a year after being found drunk while attempting to start up his car. In mitigation, his lawyer claimed he was suffering from [...] "overwork, worry and insomnia." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Asian, Pakistan, Russian, South African and Middle East, Canary Islands: Las Palmas de Gran Canaria markets, the new Civic has slight but {{noticeable}} styling {{differences from}} the American version. While the arcing line sweeping {{across the front}} fascia is retained, the main <b>headlights</b> <b>dip</b> away from the main arc for a more sporty appearance. The front bumper also has more vents with a steeper angle and sharper corners than the U.S. Civic. Meanwhile, the taillights are more reminiscent of the Integra, with the main round brake lights dipping slightly down into the indicators. By contrast, the taillights of the U.S. Civic resemble those of an Audi A4. On the interior side, the Asian-market Civic has contrasting two tone colour scheme. The three-spoke steering wheel from the American Civic Si and the European hatchback is standard.|$|R
5000|$|In many countries, every motorcycle's {{low beam}} {{headlamp}} has been wired to illuminate whenever the engine is running, either {{as a matter of}} law or of voluntary industry practice. Some motorcycling advocacy groups are concerned over the potential for reduced motorcycle [...] with the introduction of headlamp-based DRLs on cars and other dual-track vehicles, since it means motorcycles are no longer the only vehicles displaying headlamps during the day. Some researchers have suggested that amber DRLs be reserved for use exclusively on motorcycles, in countries where amber is not presently a permissible color for DRLs on any vehicles, while other research has concluded there is a safety disbenefit to two 90 mm x 520 cd DRLs on motorcycles in comparison to one 190 mm x 270 cd <b>dipped</b> (low) beam <b>headlight.</b> The latter result suggests that DRL luminous area may have an important influence on its effectiveness.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{described}} by a motoring correspondent of The Times as follows:The four-door body has four sidewindows and makes a comfortable four-seater; the doors have roll armrests and ashtrays {{and there is a}} central pull-down rest. The rear windows are [...] "carried well back and allow a very fair view". The doors have slip pockets and glass louvres that conform to the body's lines. There is a cupboard in the instrument panel and the instruments and ashtray are centrally placed. There are two-way visors, independent wiper controls (left and right), a spring steering wheel and in its centre ignition, <b>dip</b> and switch (<b>headlights),</b> signalling and horn controls. There are ventilators in the scuttle, a sliding roof and a fully opening windscreen. The front seats are adjustable, the backrests will tip up and beneath them there are floor wells for the feet of the back passengers. A stabilising bumper and two horns are fitted at the front.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, {{sometimes}} called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan which was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was {{the loss of the}} stalk-operated <b>headlight</b> <b>dip</b> switch and horn. The dip switch ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard [...] engine. The Brabham Torana was still available, in two-door form only. It now included a sports steering wheel similar to the contemporary Holden Monaro GTS, full instrumentation, different badging, and different black accenting. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.|$|R
