500|$|Malcolm Evans' 3D Monster Maze, {{released}} for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1982, is a first-person game {{without a}} weapon; the player cannot fight the enemy, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, so must escape by finding the exit before the monster finds him. The game states its distance {{and awareness of}} the player, further raising tension. Edge stated it was about [...] "fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> in the end" [...] and considers it [...] "the original survival horror game". Retro Gamer stated, [...] "Survival horror {{may have been a}} phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could’ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans’ massive hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month that had made him look bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you made me look bad [...] so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> back tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of}} the year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|Reaction to the Master Chief as a {{character}} is mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength; others have said that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and not believable. UGO ranked the Master Chief at number eight on its 2007 list of top heroes of all time", ahead of fellow video game characters Samus Aran, Link, and Gordon Freeman. In 2009, GameDaily listed the [...] "strong and silent type" [...] among top 25 video game archetypes, using Master Chief as an example. Master Chief was also ranked number eight in Empires list of the greatest video game characters. In 2009, GamesRadar included him among the 25 best new characters of the decade. UGO listed Master Chief's [...] "trademark" [...] helmet in its 2011 list of the coolest helmets and headgear in video games. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the eight [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "Chief isn't the strongest or most crafty hero, and he isn't particularly charismatic or intelligent or playful. But when civilization {{is on the line}} and all other options have been exhausted, Chief is the guy who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> through." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked him as the second greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second trial}} ended in December 1990. Kevin Richardson, 14 {{years old at}} the time of the crime, was convicted of {{attempted}} murder, rape, assault, and robbery in the attacks on the joggers and others in the park, and sentenced to 5–10 years. Korey Wise, 16 {{years old at the}} time of the crime, was acquitted of those charges, but convicted of sexual abuse, assault, and riot in the attack on the jogger and others in the park, and sentenced to 5–15 years. After the verdict, Wise shouted at the prosecutor: [...] "You’re going to pay for this. Jesus is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you.</b> You made this up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gray's {{mental and}} {{physical}} state worsened {{in the months leading}} up to the attack. There was some evidence of a progressive decline in his mental state before the shootings, as he alienated the few friends he had. On the morning of 13 November, he travelled into Dunedin, and visited a bank where he objected angrily to a NZ$2.00 bank fee for a cheque. He then went to Elio's Gun Shop in King Edward Street, South Dunedin, placing a $100 deposit on a gun he intended to collect the next week. At the Continental Coffee Bar, he was served a cold pie, and became confrontational. After being asked to leave, he threatened the owners saying: [...] "I'll be back, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you.</b> I'll blow you away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didn’t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> the job. They'll just hire someone else".|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of amber}} lights to alert drivers that a spotter vehicle is parked is controversial. Light bars and strobe lights have been {{becoming}} increasingly popular with storm spotters and storm chasers since, proponents claim, both groups often travel {{in less than}} ideal weather conditions where visibility may be limited. However, in recent years, some spotters and chasers have been seen using red, blue, white, and/or green lighting devices, apparently imitating emergency vehicles. Such actions are illegal in most areas and are highly condemned by both the spotter and storm chaser communities. Said Chuck Doswell, [...] "flashing light bars added to your chase vehicle (similar to those used by law enforcement) may be illegal in some places and their use to imply some sort of official status to your chasing is probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> in trouble". Chris Novy, a trainer of storm spotters throughout the US and a veteran storm chaser, also notes that lights distract and can even unconsciously attract other drivers and that lights may encourage people to drive aggressively or to park in situations they would otherwise avoid and thus increase danger to themselves and to other drivers.|$|E
2500|$|In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan {{counselor}} {{they want}} to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is [...] "aggressively" [...] pursuing Giles. She [...] "wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life." [...] The ACORN counselor advises her [...] "you get a tin if [...] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul." [...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

2500|$|Chrisman {{was working}} for the NHRA in late 1963 or early 1964 when Ford's Fran Hernandez gave a Mercury Comet to Chrisman. After Chrisman did not race it, Hernandez asked, [...] "What's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to race that car?" [...] Chrisman responded he wanted a blower to be {{installed}} in the car. Chrisman went to a dealer, picked up the racecar, and brought it to Bill Stroppe's shop. The pair and their crew assembled the car. The car was debuted at the 1964 U.S. Nationals with Chrisman doing a burnout to half track. Chrisman toured the eastern half of the United States with the car though the end of the 1965 season. In 1966, he added a flip-up fiberglass body on the car, following a trend started by Don Nicholson and Eddie Schartman. Chrisman won his first race, at the Hot Rod Magazine Championships at Riverside Race, in the Exhibition Stock category. It is generally considered to be the first funny car to exceed [...] The car ran the quarter mile in 8.72 seconds at , beating Jungle Jim Liberman in the finals.

2500|$|In {{the final}} minutes of the game, with the Terps {{trailing}} the Cavaliers 24–17, Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell was injured and {{taken out of the}} game. He was replaced by a young second-stringer Scott Zolak. Zolak led a drive which culminated with a three-yard option run for a touchdown narrowing the deficit to a point. With 1:09 left in the game, Maryland went for two. Zolak threw into the endzone to running back Ricky Johnson. Johnson appeared to catch the ball before being hit by defensive back Keith McMeans, knocking the ball loose. An official in the endzone immediately signaled for a catch, before others waved it as incomplete. After the game, the usually level-headed Terps head coach Joe Krivak ran to the official who made the initial call, following him to the locker room, and then ran over to yell at referee Don Safrit. Several witnesses claim he said to the officials that [...] "If it takes every ounce of energy, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of this league." [...] Virginia (7–4) broke their 16-game losing streak in the series and finished second in the conference. Maryland (5–6) failed to achieve a winning season for the third consecutive year. However, the Cavaliers failed to secure a bowl game berth, while N.C. State with a worse record went on to the Peach Bowl.|$|E
