50|$|By {{the end of}} 2013, Boombotix {{had already}} sold over sixty {{thousand}} Boombot units. Boombotix products received {{a fair amount of}} press and reviews for their portable speaker product, from the action sports and consumer electronics sectors alike. Boombotix has targeted the cycling community with a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mount</b> kit to clip the speaker on, which has garnered Boombotix a strong following in the urban cycling community.|$|E
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this project is to design and {{manufacture}} a bicycle handlebar mounted case that will house Apple’s iPhone 5 and a charging system that utilizes a charge from a generator hub in the front wheel of a bicycle. The charging system and software for this project will be developed by an Electrical Engineering Graduate student. The case and charging system must be a self-contained unit that is weather-proof and aesthetically pleasing. It must allow the user to use all {{of the features of}} the iPhone 5 under a wide range of speeds. It must be adjustable between portrait and landscape orientations. The necessary components of the case, a liner, and <b>handlebar</b> <b>mount</b> were developed, designed, sourced and prototyped to create a functioning prototype using a variety of industrial and manufacturing engineering skills. The designed components were 3 D modeled using SolidWorks Computer Aided Design software. These parts were then rapid prototyped using a Stratasys 3 D printer. A liner was made by pouring silicone into a wax mold that was machined on a Hass MiniMill. Documents were produced that would aid in the manufacture of this case as a consumer product. A cost analysis was completed that compare multiple manufacturing options for a case, one an injection molded plastic case and the other a machined aluminum case. The breakeven point for these two processes was found to be 266 units with a cost per unit of $ 73. Many things were learned though the course of this project. Skills that were learned through many courses taken at Cal Poly were applied to a real problem and then used to solve the problem. Through research and with the guidance of peers and professors I was able to take this project from an idea to a functioning prototype. I learned how to look at the bigger picture when developing ideas and products and to explore all avenues for the best solution. In the future I would obtain more feedback from potential users and peers because they often can offer advice and solutions that may have been over looked. I would recommend that this idea and product be further developed into a consumer product...|$|E
5000|$|... 1984 model had taller <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounts</b> {{for a more}} upright seating position. Also had {{a plastic}} cover inside the fairing to block {{headlight}} scatter and to conceal wiring.|$|R
25|$|In the 1989 Race Across America, {{one team}} (Team Strawberry) used an {{experimental}} device comprising a rear wheel hub, a sensor, and a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> processor, to measure each cyclist's power output.|$|R
50|$|Other aspects {{included}} a dual seat, with locking under-seat storage, a storage pocket {{on the inside}} of the front fairing and a centre stand. A <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> binnacle forming part of the front upper bodywork contained basic instrumentation.|$|R
50|$|New for 2010, the Victory Cross Country Motorcycle is a hard-bagger cruiser with a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> fairing. It has a Freedom V-Twin Engine, 21 {{gallons of}} cargo capacity, 4.7 inches of {{suspension}} travel, floorboards, cruise control and an MP3-compatible sound system.|$|R
50|$|Bottom bracket power meters {{rely on the}} {{torsional}} deflection in the BB shaft. This is done by {{the shaft}} having a disc at each end with perforations. These perforations are detected using non-contact photo-electric sensors that detect when torque is applied to the left pedal and then doubled. Data is sent digitally to a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> computer unit.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} incarnation launched in 1983, the XJ900 had an air-cooled, double overhead camshaft, 853 cc 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 8-valve engine. Originally {{fitted with a}} <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> bikini fairing, its handling came in for criticism. This was quickly replaced with a frame mounted upper fairing and retrofitted to all models. The 1983 XJ900 came with anti-dive front forks, shaft drive and has triple disc brakes (2 front, 1 rear).|$|R
5000|$|The Ducati GT1000 used {{a similar}} steel tubular trellis frame to the Paul Smart and the Sport1000, {{and the same}} Desmodue [...] engine. It was {{designed}} with comfort in mind and intended for sport-touring riders. The frame differed from the Sport1000 in the addition of mounting points for twin shocks and side panels. The GT1000 had touring <b>handlebars,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the same front forks as the Sport has clip-ons: non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi upside-down forks.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{equipped}} with capacitor discharge electronic ignition, disc front and drum rear brakes and Comstar wheels. It had both electric and kick start and centre and side stands. Electrics were 12 volt, and the battery was housed in a side panel. The other side panel contained a small toolkit. Instrumentation was {{by way of a}} <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> binnacle. This contained a tachometer, warning lights for main beam, ignition/neutral and indicators, and a speedometer in miles per hour, with markings for kilometres, plus an odometer.|$|R
5000|$|The rubber-gaiters were {{replaced}} by a cleaned up [...] "Ceriani-style" [...] set of forks. A touted benefit was better engine cooling but, with ram air, this was a non-issue for the most part. The three separate carburetors {{were replaced}} by three unitized rack mounted carburetors with a push-pull cable arrangement. The benefits of this were less costly carburetor balancing and more accurate fuel metering. The <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> cable operated choke was gone, replaced by a lever mounted directly on the rack of carbs. The cylinder head and the ram air shroud were redesigned to cater for this new carb setup.|$|R
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the Euro III Emission standards, the XL125V Varadero would either have needed to be withdrawn from production or modified. In 2007, Honda elected to continue with the model and so developed a new electronic fuel injection system based on the PGM-FI system used by other Honda motorcycles. At this time Honda also decided to bring about a major restyle to bring the model in line with company appearance trends at the time. The changes included a restyled front fairing which includes wind screen, indicators and headlight, an all new dashboard which now included a fuel reserve warning light and new fairing mounted wing mirrors, previously <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first ZX-9R {{could be}} seen as a ZXR750 {{incorporating}} a number of ZZ-R1100 design features. The wheels - three-spoke cast aluminium alloy 3.5-inch x 17-inch front and 5.5-inch x 17-inch rear -, the front forks - fully adjustable 43 mm upside-down KYB - and unbraced fabricated aluminium box-section swingarm with fully adjustable remote-reservoir KYB monoshock were direct carry-overs from the ZXR. The twin-piston rear Tokico caliper no longer mounted via a torque arm, and the clip-on <b>handlebars</b> <b>mounted</b> above the top triple clamp, not below. The four-piston Tokico front calipers and 320 mm front discs were common to the ZZ-R and the ZXR.|$|R
5000|$|A {{new version}} of the Chopper, the Mk 3, was {{launched}} in 2004, the Chopper having being out of production for almost 25 years. The Mk3, in deference to modern safety concerns, adopts a more conventional saddle design to discourage [...] "backies", and has dropped the groin-catching gear lever in favour of <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> gear controls; to commemorate this former feature the Mk 3 has a sticker where the lever once was located. The frame is made from aluminium alloy tubing, rather than the originals' steel, to make the bicycle lighter. The wheels are again 20 inches for the back wheel and 16 for the front wheel. The MK3 remains in production to this day.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{reported}} that [...] "on 12th January 1900 E. M. Bowden granted a licence to The Raleigh Cycle Company of Nottingham", whose directors were Frank Bowden and Edward Harlow. At this signing they became members of 'E. M. Bowden's Patent Syndicate Limited'. The syndicate included, among others, R. H. Lea & Graham I. Francis of Lea & Francis Ltd, and William Riley of the Riley Cycle Company. The Raleigh company were soon offering the Bowden Brake as an accessory, and {{were quick to}} incorporate the cable into <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> Sturmey-Archer (in which they had a major interest) gear changes. Undoubtedly this is why E. Bowden and F. Bowden are sometimes confused today.|$|R
50|$|The {{team was}} {{sponsored}} by Power Pacer, a human power measurement device that consisted of a rear-wheel hub, a frame mounted sensor and a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> processor. McDonald struck a sponsorship deal with Balboa Instruments, maker of the device, whereby the team would test the product during the company's product research and development. As a condition of the sponsorship agreement, McDonald agreed to have the team use the equipment during the actual cross-country race which limited the team to spoked wheels rather than the faster and more efficient Time trial bicycle setup with Disk Wheels as used by the other teams. This hurt Team Strawberry in the competition by reducing their average speed, but the sacrifice contributed {{to the advancement of}} the technology.|$|R
5000|$|The handle bars on some rowed {{vehicles}} {{travel on}} a semicircular path {{due to the}} <b>handlebars</b> being <b>mounted</b> to a fixed length lever pinned to the frame. Some attempt to simulate the more level stroke used in rowing a boat, for example Streetrower and Vogabike. Streetrower has [...] "the most natural rowing action of any rowing vehicle to date".|$|R
50|$|ECOXPOWER is a pedal powered {{headlight}} and GPS/Mobile device charger for {{use with}} a bicycle. The device mounts to {{the hub of the}} front wheel of a bicycle. When the wheels turn, the internal dynamo-USB power generator charges a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, this battery has a capacity of 700mAh, with an approximate 500 charge cycle battery life. Lighting is provided by an Ultra-bright LED 1W 80 LUX white headlight and 2 rear LED red lights. Lighting time without riding is approx. 1.5 hours with a fully charged battery. A Power Jack & Cable Connection powers & recharges the lighting system for your bicycle & charges optional attached devices. The headlight can be turned ON/OFF from the <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> wired remote control (included) on your bicycle.

Designed to fit most bicycles, the device ships with tools for installation.|$|R
50|$|The M50 was {{developed}} using the C50 frame and rear swingarm, {{which is a}} softail type with a hidden single shock absorber, compared to the Marauder's traditional swingarm with two exposed shock absorbers. The M50 received different fenders and fuel tank from the C50, a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> speedometer cluster, and inverted 41mm forks, {{to give it a}} more muscular appearance than the C50 semi-sister. The basic M50 engine was slightly modified, being painted black instead of the chrome found on the C50 engine. Internally, the engine received split crank bearings instead of the C50's one-piece bearings, as well as slightly modified valvetrain components, which necessitated modifications to the cylinder heads. Power output is identical to the C50 power plant, and both displace 805 cc. Both models share a 5 speed transmission inside a shared crankcase with the engine with wet clutch, water cooling, a single front disc brake, and a rod operated rear drum brake.|$|R
5000|$|The B1 had {{conventional}} 7/8" [...] handlebars {{as found}} on all earlier Kawasaki [...] "Z" [...] series bikes, the B2 had clip on style <b>handlebars</b> that <b>mounted</b> {{to the top}} of the fork tube above the top triple clamp, this style then featured on the later ZX1100A models. This style was to continue to be the norm for most sports bikes, especially the Kawasaki GPZ900R series released in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{features}} {{being the}} ability to be re-configured in the field with 16 channels available on the selector knob and fifteen other groups of sixteen available with a simple tool. The radio operates on spread spectrum and has a good level of security being designed with LPI (low probability of interception). An inbuilt receiver enables the radio to be keyed remotely via a short range encoded Press To Talk switch fob, the switch being mounted on a weapon or hand grip of a military vehicle. The switch code can be changed in the field and the radio configured to work with up to 4 different switches (useful for soldiers sharing transport such as motor cycles where the PTT switch can be <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted).</b> The side mounted switch- pack is supplied with a single Transmit switch for general use and a double switch pack and auxiliary lead and connector to operate a second [...] "Bowman" [...] radio from the same users headset. Multiple security switches and block outs are fitted to prevent re transmission of secure Bowman signals over the personal network.|$|R
50|$|The natural design {{progression}} from the Lotec was the Pullman combination motorcycle. The heavy but economic Mini engine lent itself {{to having a}} sidecar attached for long distance touring. The first Austel Pullman prototype appeared in 1987 with a Mini 850cc engine, shaft drive, solenoid operated <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> gear change, drum brakes, Austel 8 spoke steel wheels and leading link anti dive front forks. The production models were revised to have 1300cc engines, full duplex frame with box section swing arm, twin front disc brakes with single rear disc and a front-mounted radiator. With the sidecar attached it was then {{possible to have a}} manual gearbox with hand gear stick although this meant the gear selection was rotated 90 degrees due the engine being positioned longitudinally in the frame. The sidecar choice was down to the customer and could be fitted with a fuel tank in the boot for greater capacity and a dummy tank on the bike that could be removed easily for engine maintenance. No two Austel motorcycles were ever the same due to design developments and customer requirements.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{uncommon}} adjustable stems {{have the}} <b>handlebar</b> clamp unit <b>mounted</b> on a moveable slide, permitting variable {{fore and aft}} settings. This adjustable stem was developed by a famous cyclist, Major Taylor, hence they are sometimes called Major Taylor Outriggers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Honda SH50 is a , air-cooled, two stroke, single cylinder, scooter style, {{restricted}} moped {{manufactured by}} the Honda Motor Company between 1984 and 2006, with substantial revisions for the 1996 model year. It {{was equipped with}} continuously variable automatic transmission, (Honda V-Matic transmission) together with both electric and kick start, automatic choke and capacitor discharge electronic ignition. Brakes were drum front and rear, (disc front on later models) operated pedal-cycle style by two handlebar levers. The early models had some resemblance to Honda's C50/70/90 Super Cub range with a similar shape, dual seat and rear carrier, but with a scooter type floor, unlike the P series of mopeds such as the Honda PC50 or the Honda Express N series, which had cycle style construction. The SH50 was {{also known as the}} City Express and in some markets, as the Scoopy. All models had cycle type wheels as against the smaller wheels of later 50cc scooter style mopeds. The battery, fuel tank and two-stroke-oil reservoir were contained under the seat. Electrics were 12 volt and a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> binnacle, which effectively formed part of the front bodywork, contained basic instrumentation and warning lights.|$|R
5000|$|The Series 1A Interceptor was {{introduced}} in 1967, with two sub models GP7 and TT7. The major change was the introduction of coil ignition, eliminating the magneto. The US models received a new chrome tank, a new seat, instrument <b>mounts,</b> <b>handlebar,</b> and mudguards. [...] All S1A interceptors had twin Mark 1 Amal carburettors.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{the first}} CL125S was {{manufactured}} using this new motor in its design, {{with a larger}} 122 cc piston (which produced more low-end torque but little gain in power) and a slightly larger piston/rod connecting pin. That helped push the dry weight of the bike down to 196 lb. This motorcycle was almost identical to the 1970 to 1973 CL100, that was really only a slight modification of the CB series produced at the same time. The modifications included; lower rear sprocket gearing, slightly more aggressive tires, shorter front fender, braced <b>handlebar,</b> high <b>mount</b> exhaust system and elimination of the tachometer.|$|R
50|$|A Motorcycle {{handlebar}} is a {{tubular component}} of a motorcycle's steering mechanism. <b>Handlebars</b> provide a <b>mounting</b> place for controls such as brake, throttle, clutch, horn, light switch and rear view mirrors; and they may support part of the rider's weight. Even when a handlebar is a single piece it is usually {{referred to in the}} plural as handlebars.|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} {{high-power}} flashlights with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Although not {{specifically designed for}} bicycle use, these are {{a viable alternative to}} rechargeable halogen lights, though they are still expensive. They can be fastened to the bicycle <b>handlebars</b> with various <b>mounting</b> devices such as a lock-block. Although the optics of these flashlights are generally high quality they are still rotationally symmetrical (unlike motor vehicle lights).|$|R
50|$|The Bowden {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} by Irishman Ernest Monnington Bowden (1860 to April 3, 1904) of 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. The first patent was granted in 1896 (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570), and the invention {{was reported in the}} Automotor Journal of 1897 where Bowden's address was given as 9 Fopstone Rd, Earls Court. The principal element of this was a flexible tube (made from hard wound wire and fixed at each end) containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope {{from one end to the}} other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes, although it had the potential for other applications. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press in 1896. It consisted of a stirrup, pulled up by the cable from a <b>handlebar</b> <b>mounted</b> lever, with rubber pads acting against the rear wheel rim. At this date bicycles were fixed wheel, additional braking being offered by a 'plunger' brake pressing on the front tyre. The Bowden offered extra braking power still, and was novel enough to appeal to riders who scorned the plunger arrangement, which was heavy and potentially damaging to the (expensive) pneumatic tyre. The problem for Bowden was his failure to develop effective distribution networks and the brake was often incorrectly, or inappropriately fitted, resulting in a good number of complaints being aired in the press. Its most effective application was on those machines fitted with Westwood pattern steel rims which offered flat bearing surfaces for the brake pads.|$|R
50|$|Handlebars {{are made}} from round-section metal tubing, {{typically}} aluminium alloys or chrome plated steel but also of carbon fibre and titanium, shaped to the desired contour. Holes may be drilled for the internal routing of control cables such as brake, throttle, and clutch. Risers hold the <b>handlebars</b> above their <b>mounting</b> position on the upper triple tree or {{the top of the}} fork, and may be integrated into the bar itself or separate items. Each handlebar end may contain bar-end weights to damp vibration by isolating the bar's resonant frequency from that of the engine. Electrically heated grips may be fitted to provide warmth for the rider in cold weather.|$|R
5000|$|Offered from 2002 through 2006, the TC {{featured}} a longer swingarm, large hard saddlebags, a re-designed seat, {{and sometimes the}} new Freedom Engine. The relatively tall seat height and roomy ergonomics made the bike ideal for larger riders. The Freedom Engine displaced , but put out significantly more power and torque than the original engine. The 2002 model and later TC also accepted the [...] big-bore kit, which increased torque further {{with the addition of}} upgraded exhaust. Later models featured rubber <b>mounted</b> <b>handlebars</b> and revised suspension settings. Deluxe versions (V92TCD) were also available with extra features popular at the time. With the deletion of the Touring Cruiser {{at the end of the}} 2006 model year, the last of the original V92 motorcycles was retired from the lineup.|$|R
5000|$|MAFAC, or Manufacture Arvernoise de Freins et Accessoires pour Cycles (Arveni Manufacturing Works for Bicycle Brakes and Accessories), was a French {{manufacturer}} of bicycle brakes and tool kits. MAFAC {{was founded in}} post-war France under the name [...] "Securité", which changed to MAFAC in the Autumn of 1947. Initially MAFAC made cantilever brakes, brake levers, and tool kits. Early MAFAC brakes {{were built in the}} cantilever configuration with a separate brake arm on each side, actuated by a straddle cable. Later MAFAC brakes were of a center-pull design in which a straddle cable links the two overlapping arms of the brake. Like the cantilever design, it is actuated by pulling from the center of this cable. MAFAC's rubber brake hoods, originating in the late 1940s, had built-in adjusters, allowing adjustment of the brakes while riding. The center-pull brakes were designed to clear fenders, front rack <b>mounts,</b> <b>handlebar</b> bags, and large tires. This made MAFAC brakes {{one of the most popular}} models from the late 1950s through the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Electric utility {{companies}} across the US {{have been using}} aerial bucket trucks for line work and troubleshooting for decades. The use of these trucks {{eliminates the need for}} workers to climb utility poles in order to repair or maintain lines. Poor ingress and egress design can lead to acute injuries (slips and falls) as well as cumulative injury (musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)). Utility companies want to know the best combination of steps and handlebars for aerial bucket ingress and egress that would minimize the risk of injury. American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard – ANSI/SIA A 92. 2 - 2009, sets design requirements for aerial buckets that provide regulations for factors of safety. Based on the testing procedures for electrical ratings (which can exceed 100 kV for electric line work), an access door to an aerial bucket is not feasible at this time for most electric utilities. The objective of this research was to test whether bucket design features for a one-person bucket offer ergonomic advantages to workers for ingress and egress. Muscular activity of the four most affected muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities were analyzed using EMG sensors throughout ingress and egress. A series of conditions that integrated variations of the design features (inside step, outside steps and a horizontal handle bar) were tested. Based on results, the following design recommendations would decrease the risk of a slip or fall and the biomechanical loading to the upper extremities when entering and exiting the bucket: 1. Always have an inside step – on either the front side (side with the outer steps) or in an adjacent corner location. 2. Have one outside step, with a horizontal handlebar on the boom side of bucket for support. 3. If a bucket has two outer steps, then a horizontal <b>handlebar</b> must be <b>mounted</b> on the boom side of bucket...|$|R
5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin bore raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the <b>handlebars</b> to a <b>mount</b> molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the clutch pressure plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|R
