5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route26, an {{unsigned}} legislative route extending <b>from</b> <b>Little</b> Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville, Salisbury, and Prospect.

By 1920, Route26 was reconfigured to run directly from Barneveld to Little Falls while {{the portion of}} former Route26 between Prospect and Remsen became part of a realigned Route25. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Barneveld–Remsen portion of legislative Route25 was bypassed by NY12, which was assigned to Route25's original, direct alignment between the two villages instead. The portion of legislative Route25 between Barneveld and Prospect was designated as part of NY287 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex.

The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences.
