25|$|Different sources {{claim the}} ARJ21 closely resembles either the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 or the MD-90 which were license-produced in China. Chinese {{factories}} producing parts for the MD-90 {{went on to}} produce the ARJ21 using tooling retained {{after the end of}} the MD-80/MD-90 licensed production program.. China claims that the ARJ21 is a completely indigenous design in spite of the fact that production drawings seen for the fuselage during development were simply McDonnell Douglas drawings with the identifying legend overlaid with a Chinese legend. The ARJ21's development did depend heavily on foreign suppliers, including engines and avionics from the United States. The ARJ21 features an all-new supercritical wing having a sweepback of 25degrees and designed by Ukraine’s Antonov Design Bureau. It is fitted with winglets to improve aerodynamic performance. Antonov also assisted the project with geometrical determination and integral analysis of the construction strength of ARJ21. Some of China's supercomputers have been used to <b>design</b> <b>parts</b> for ARJ21.|$|E

50|$|Being an {{additive}} manufacturing technique, DMLS doesn’t incur any extra {{cost for the}} complexity of the part. The build volume along with the number of layers is what determines the production cost and time. DMLS eliminates the need for tool production however such technologies are impervious to economies of scale. Therefore, it is recommended to <b>design</b> <b>parts</b> with least amount of superfluous volumes, building only the relevant geometries. Furthermore the parts should be designed to avoid assembly requirements because printing sub-assembly with intricate geometries is now possible.|$|E
