5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship {{is more about}} sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer {{wants to be the}} star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E

500|$|A few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, {{everyone}} and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who [...] "feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|E

[...] The performance, by the Kol Yisrael Orchestra with the Tel Aviv Chamber Choir, was acclaimed by the audience of 3000, but received mixed reviews from the press. The Times report noted contrasting opinions from [...] two leading Israeli newspapers. The correspondent for Haaretz had expressed disappointment: [...] "Every tone is unoriginal, and the work repeats old effects in a most conventional manner". Conversely, according to the Times report, HaBokers critic had [...] "found that the composition had moved everyone to the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul ... no Jewish composer had ever written anything so sublime on the theme of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Frieze of Life" [...] themes recur {{throughout}} Munch's {{work but}} he especially focused {{on them in}} the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or {{as the cause of}} great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).|$|E
2500|$|... "Turn Blue", at {{just under}} seven minutes the longest {{song on the}} album, was a {{sprawling}} confessional that dated back to an abortive recording session by Bowie and Pop in May 1975, when the latter was in the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> drug addiction. Originally titled [...] "Moving On", it was composed by Bowie, Pop, Walter Lacey and Warren Peace. It was the only set of lyrics that did not appear on the original vinyl record sleeve. The album's remaining tracks included [...] "Sixteen", the only piece written entirely by Iggy Pop, [...] "Some Weird Sin", a hard rock number featuring a [...] "lost-boy lyric", the [...] "neo-punk" [...] "Neighborhood Threat", and [...] "Fall in Love with Me", which grew from an impromptu jam by the band to which Pop composed lyrics apparently evoking his then-flame, Esther Friedmann.|$|E
2500|$|The {{school of}} Romantic hermeneutics {{stressed}} that historically embedded interpreters—a [...] "living" [...] {{rather than a}} Cartesian dualism or [...] "theoretical" [...] subject—use 'understanding' and 'interpretation' (Verstehen), which combine individual-psychological and social-historical description and analysis, to gain a greater knowledge of texts and authors in their contexts. [...] However, Dilthey remains distinct from other German Romantics and life philosophers through his emphasis on “historicality.” [...] Dilthey understood man as a historical being. [...] However, history is not {{described in terms of}} an object of the past, but “a series of world views.” [...] Man cannot understand himself through reflection or introspection, but only through what “history can tell him…never in objective concepts but always only in the living experience which springs up out of the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own being.” [...] Dilthey wants to emphasize the “intrinsic temporality of all understanding,” that man’s understanding is dependent on past worldviews, interpretations, and a shared world.|$|E

2500|$|Pieces of a Man {{received}} stronger retrospective {{reviews from}} music critics.

[...] Despite noting that [...] "Save the Children" [...] is relatively [...] "atrocious" [...] to the [...] "stunning" [...] opening track, Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic called Pieces of a Man [...] "a seriously solid soul record" [...] and commented that it is [...] "smooth in its execution, but it's stern and solid in its message".

2500|$|A {{short time}} later, both Mark and Roger are {{simultaneously}} reaching an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory.

The characters' parents leave several worried messages on their phones ("Voice Mail #5"), and on Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code (A-N-G-E-L). Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who has been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, but not before telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, which reveals the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light, except that a vision of Angel told her to go back. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is [...] "no day but today" [...] ("Finale B").|$|E
