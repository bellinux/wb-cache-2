5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an <b>electrically-operated</b> minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of this transformation, the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing guns in the 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats or mine sweepers attempting {{to break through the}} defences. The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E

25|$|In 1944 the {{prototype}} was rebuilt as the M.48 Messenger 3 with fully retractable <b>electrically-operated</b> split trailing-edge flaps and a 155 h.p.Cirrus Major III engine. This model was not further developed {{as it did}} not provide any advantage over the other variants.|$|E
25|$|These are four- and six-car sets {{based at}} Makuhari Depot {{modified}} in 2009 from former Keihin-Tōhoku Line 209-0 series ten-car sets {{for use on}} Chiba area and Bōsō Peninsula local services from 1 October 2009. The first four-car set was outshopped from Nagano Works in June 2009. Modifications include new electrical equipment, the addition of transverse seating, LED destination indicator panels, and a toilet. The cars are numbered in the -2100 series, although some four-car sets have end cars numbered in the -2000 series. The -2000 series cars are converted from early batch 209-0 series units with air-operated doors rather than the <b>electrically-operated</b> doors of later batch units.|$|E
25|$|Despite strong {{sales of}} the M20, Mooney was short of cash. The {{development}} of the M22 Mustang had cost more than expected, and was ultimately unsuccessful. The collaboration with Mitsubishi had come with substantial financial assistance but proved {{too much for the}} company to handle. It went into chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 1969; American Electronics Laboratories quickly acquired Mooney in March of that year and invested US$600,000 to keep it operating. Sales that year were {{less than half of the}} previous year's figures, although a new model, the M20E Chapparal, was released with <b>electrically-operated</b> flaps and landing gear. AEL was unable to turn the company around and sold Mooney to Butler Aviation International in December 1969. AEL owned Mooney for just over 9 months and lost nearly a million dollars during that time. Butler Aviation also acquired the troubled Aerostar company and combined it with Mooney in an attempt to save both. The Mooney name was dropped in 1970, as was the M20 designation; the planes were called Aerostars.|$|E
500|$|Retvizans {{armament}} {{was built}} by the Obukhov Works in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation. The main armament consisted of two pairs of 12-inch 40-calibre guns mounted in French-style <b>electrically-operated</b> centre-pivot twin turrets fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and could depress to -5°. The ship carried 77 rounds per gun and the guns could fire one round every 80 to 90 seconds. They fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] {{to a range of}} [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 the Type 75 was {{replaced}} by the Elite Mark 2 Type 83. This version received a larger [...] Lotus 912 engine. The chassis was now galvanised steel and the five speed BMC gearbox {{was replaced}} by a Getrag Type 265 unit. The vacuum-operated headlights of the earlier model were replaced with <b>electrically-operated</b> units and the Elite was now fitted with a front spoiler, a new rear bumper and brake lights from the Rover SD1.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly {{during the}} 1890s, Macedonski was a {{follower}} of Edgar Allan Poe and of Gothic fiction in general, producing a Romanian version of Poe's Metzengerstein story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting [...] "Gothic" [...] themes in his original prose. Indebted to Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, Macedonski also wrote a number of science fiction stories, including the 1913 Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought, which depicts civilization {{on the verge of}} a crisis. The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation. Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought is noted for anticipating television, the ship being equipped with <b>electrically-operated</b> [...] "large and clear mirrors" [...] that display [...] "images from various parts of the Earth". Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a silent film screenplay based on Comment on devient riche et puissant.|$|E
2500|$|Saxby Bridge is a {{wrought iron}} single span with timber decking, {{dating from the}} mid-19th century, which is {{virtually}} unaltered, apart from minor repairs to the decking. Horkstow Bridge is John Rennie's only known suspension bridge, {{and is one of}} the earliest unaltered suspension bridges in Britain. It is Grade II* listed. As the river nears the Humber, a high-level conveyor belt carries material from South Ferriby quarry to the cement works at Ferriby Sluice. The conveyor is [...] long, and is used to transfer around 3000 tonnes of crushed chalk and 1,000 tonnes of clay per day. This stretch of the river has numerous moorings, and the Humber Keel & Sloop Preservation Society usually moor their keel Comrade and their sloop Amy Houson just above the final lock. The lock at Ferriby Sluice has two sets of gates: a low level set pointing upstream, and a set of much taller gates pointing downstream which prevent the river being inundated by tides, and allow vessels to leave when the Humber is at a higher level than the Ancholme. In order to minimise the ingress of brackish water into the Ancholme when the tide gates are used, the water is culverted into the West Drain when the lock is being emptied. The sluice consists of three sets of pointed doors, and two <b>electrically-operated</b> vertical guillotine gates. Salinity in the river is further controlled by two bubble curtains, and is continuously measured at Saxby, with the information used to decide whether the flow should be supplemented by water from the Trent Witham Ancholme Transfer Scheme.|$|E

50|$|The Victorian Railways' {{plan for}} {{electrification}} of the Melbourne suburban rail network began in 1914, {{with the first}} <b>electrically-operated</b> trains running in 1918. The original concept involved hundreds of country and suburban carriages being rebuilt, swapping bodies and underframes and splicing or adding compartments to achieve the required capacity and a fairly standardised carriage design for each purpose.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 {{alterations}} {{were completed}} {{to allow the}} fort {{to be used as}} a central anti-aircraft ammunition depot for the south west, which included installing an <b>electrically-operated</b> hoist and the construction of a loading platform. Nothe Fort did not see combat until World War II, as the main threat was from the air. Beforehand, the guns had mainly been fired for training and competitive events.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{featured}} two three-bladed, 35 ft rotors {{in tandem}} in which blades could be folded for storage.

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{so-called}} Saxon-Franconian trunk line, Interregio-Express and InterCity services formerly ran on the Dresden-Werdau line at two or four-hour intervals, but since December 2006, the Franken-Sachsen-Express, running on the Dresden-Hof-Nuremberg has only had {{the quality of a}} regional service. These regional express trains operated hourly or two-hourly, depending on the timetable year. In December 2014 this service was replaced by an hourly, <b>electrically-operated</b> Regional-Express service on the Dresden-Hof route.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{common type}} was {{originally}} developed by Wallace R. Turnbull and refined by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. This <b>electrically-operated</b> mechanism was first tested in on June 6, 1927 at Camp Borden, Ontario, Canada and patented in 1929 (...) [...] It was favoured by some pilots in World War II, because {{even when the}} engine was no longer running the propeller could be feathered. On hydraulically-operated propellers the feathering had to happen before the loss of hydraulic pressure in the engine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980 the Type 75 was {{replaced}} by the Elite Mark 2 Type 83. This version received a larger [...] Lotus 912 engine.

50|$|A new {{automatic}} transmission from Zahnradfabrik of Friedrichshafen (ZF) {{was built for}} the fitting, it had three clutching levels in the torque converter and twelve speeds. The transmission also included an <b>electrically-operated</b> clutch that mechanically disengaged from the engine completely at 5,000 rpm, below which the engine produced no torque on the output. At full speed, 14,000 rpm, the engine itself also acted {{in the manner of}} a huge flywheel, which greatly improved cross-country performance by allowing some of the engine's excess speed to be dumped into the transmission to pull the tank over bumps.|$|E
