5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as <b>ice</b> <b>creams)</b> or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E

50|$|In 1843, Nancy M. Johnson {{invented the}} first <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> maker with a crank {{on the outside}} of the wooden tub. The crank mixes the <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> while also {{scraping}} the frozen <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> off of the sides of the pot. Before 1843, making <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> required more time. The crank {{on the outside of}} the wooden tub eliminates the step of removing the pot from the wooden tub to scrape the sides of the pot of frozen <b>ice</b> <b>cream.</b> After the creation of Nancy Johnson’s invention, commercial <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> companies started to use <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> makers powered by “horse-powered treadmills, steam engines, and finally electric motors”. People who made <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> at home began using electric <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> makers as well. <b>Ice</b> <b>cream</b> production was more popular when sugar became cheaper and ice was easier to attain. After the Civil War ended, <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> prices had decreased, and more wholesalers had joined the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> making business.|$|R
25|$|The ripened {{fruit is}} {{considered}} the more palatable, as it becomes sweeter and less sour (acidic) as it matures. It is used in desserts, as a jam, blended into juices, or sweetened drinks, sorbets, <b>ice</b> <b>creams</b> and other snacks. In Western cuisine, it is found in Worcestershire Sauce. In most parts of India, tamarind extract is used to flavor foods, in curries and traditional dishes, and tamarind sweet chutney is popular in India and Pakistan as a dressing for many snacks. Tamarind pulp is a key ingredient in flavoring curries and rice in south Indian cuisine, {{as well as in}} the Chigali lollipop. Across the Middle East, from the Levant to Iran, tamarind is used in savory dishes, notably meat-based stews, and often combined with dried fruits to achieve a sweet-sour tang.|$|E
25|$|Many new {{restaurants}} and cafes appeared {{in and around}} the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards, usually close to the twenty-three theaters. A new café, Tortoni, specializing in <b>ice</b> <b>creams,</b> opened in 1795 at the corner of rue Taibout and the grand boulevards. The {{new restaurants}} in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops or nobles who had gone into exile. The restaurant Méot offered a menu with over a hundred dishes. Beside Méot and Beauvilliers, the Palais-Royal had the restaurants Naudet, Robert, Very, Foy and Huré, and the Cafés Berceau, Lyrique, Liberté Conquise, de Chartres, and du Sauvage (the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal there were more popular cafés, usually with music, smaller menus and more reasonable prices. One restaurant in the cellars, Postal, offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the cafes in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the Café des Aveugles, which had an orchestra of blind musicians.|$|E
