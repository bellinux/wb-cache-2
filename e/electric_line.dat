5|$|The London Underground, {{commonly}} referred to as the Tube, is the oldest and second longest metro system in the world. The system serves 270 stations and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground <b>electric</b> <b>line,</b> the City and South London Railway. It dates from 1863.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} list {{contains a}} chronology {{of when the}} various sections of mainline railway lines were electrified. The list excludes industrial and short branch lines, as well as systems installed at ports and yards. The list contains the date when the electrification was taken into regular use on each section. It also notes if a section was opened as an electric railway, and if the line was prepared as an <b>electric</b> <b>line,</b> but where this was not taken into use immediately. The list contains the line and section to be electrified, and its length. The length indicates {{the length of the}} mainline section at the time of electrification. Due to changes of routes and shortening of lines, the current length of sections may be shorter. The sixth column shows the electrification system, including voltage and frequency in case of AC and no frequency in case of DC.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>lines</b> {{opened in}} succession; Nether Edge to Tinsley on 6 September 1899, to Walkley on 18 September 1899 and Pitsmoor on 27 September 1899. The other <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> opened soon after {{allowing}} the Hillsborough {{to be closed}} in November 1902.|$|R
40|$|Uninterrupted {{power supply}} has become {{indispensable}} during the maintenance task of active <b>electric</b> power <b>lines</b> {{as a result}} of today's highly information-oriented society and increasing demand of electric utilities. The maintenance task has the risk of electric shock and the danger of falling from high place. Therefore it is necessary to realize an autonomous robot system using electro-hydraulic manipulator because hydraulic manipulators have the advantage of electric insulation. Meanwhile it is relatively difficult to realize autonomous assembly tasks particularly in the case of manipulating flexible objects uch as <b>electric</b> <b>lines.</b> In this report, a discrete vent control system is introduced for automatic assembly task of <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> into sleeves as one of the typical task of active <b>electric</b> power <b>lines.</b> In the implementation f a discrete vent control system, LVQNN (linear vector quantization neural network) is applied to the insertion task of <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> to sleeves. In order to apply these proposed control system to the unknown environment, virtual learning data for LVQNN is generated by fuzzy inference. By the experimental results of two types of <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> and sleeves, these proposed discrete event control and neural network learning algorithm are confirmed very effective to the insertion tasks of <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> to sleeves as a typical task of active electric power maintenance tasks...|$|R
30|$|The flow {{restriction}} over <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> and pipelines {{could affect the}} scheduling of energy storages, depending on where the reservoirs are located. In order to compare only the effect of energy storage (water or NG) over the total operating costs, <b>electric</b> <b>lines</b> and pipelines capacity limits have been relaxed.|$|R
25|$|In Italy {{electric}} trams {{have run}} from {{the last years of}} the 19th century (the first horse-drawn line opened in Turin in 1871). The first <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> was opened in Milan in 1893.|$|E

25|$|Lane Cove: opened as an <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams {{connecting}} with other electric services at Ridge Street.

25|$|The {{design of}} these units {{was based on}} an earlier vehicle, {{numbered}} 68000, which was used as a parcels van on the Tyneside DC electrified network. When the South Tyneside network was de-electrified in 1967, the unit was initially transferred for use on the Southport - Liverpool <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> before being withdrawn..|$|E

25|$|In 1993 {{the power}} grid {{connections}} in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380kV and a 110kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban Autobahn, use overhead lines. The Berlin 380-kV <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> is {{the backbone of the}} city's energy grid.|$|E

These {{include three}} Crew Leaders, six First Class Linemen, three Second Class Linemen, one Lead Cable Splicer, and one Apprentice Lineman.

25|$|Chatswood: also opened {{initially}} as an <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> from Crows Nest with services {{connecting with}} the cable trams at Ridge Street and sharing the cable tracks {{as far as}} Crows Nest. It opened as far as Victoria Avenue, Willoughby in April 1898 and extended to Chatswood station in July 1908.

25|$|On January 28, 1935, to {{mark the}} {{completion}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> from Washington, D.C to New York City, PRR ran a special train pulled by PRR 4800 before it opened the line for revenue service on February 10. It made a round trip from D.C. to Philadelphia and, on its return trip, set a speed record by arriving back in D.C. 1 hour and 50 minutes after its departure from Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Electric</b> Short <b>Line</b> Railway, {{also known}} as Luce <b>Electric</b> <b>Lines,</b> was a {{railroad}} that operated in Minnesota, originating in Minneapolis and heading westward. The railroad owes its nickname to the fact it was operated {{by members of the}} Luce family. The railroad ultimately reached beyond Clara City to Gluek. Today, the line has mostly been abandoned, but its former right-of-way now hosts the Luce Line State Trail operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The Luce Line Regional Trail operated by the Three Rivers Park District connects to the state trail, but runs on roads and paths that roughly parallel what remains of the Luce <b>Electric</b> <b>Lines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The two men {{incorporated}} the Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad Co. in 1891 with intentions {{to build the}} railroad to Mount Wilson. Unable to obtain rights of way to Mt. Wilson, Macpherson suggested an alternate route, toward Oak Mountain, a high peak {{to the west of}} Mount Wilson. They hired electrical engineer, Almarian W. Decker, who had contrived all the mathematical possibilities of an <b>electric</b> <b>line</b> and the funicular which would be required to ascend the Echo Mountain Promontory.|$|E
25|$|This line {{branched}} {{from the}} Botany {{line at the}} junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in Alexandria. The line proceeded down Erskineville Oval for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known {{as an extension of}} Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the Princes Highway near St Peters railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction. The line opened in 1902 as a single-track <b>electric</b> <b>line,</b> duplicated in 1910. It was closed in 1959. Sydney Buses' route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.|$|E
25|$|A start {{was made}} in October on the {{construction}} of the St Ann's Well Road section, this being the first new <b>electric</b> <b>line,</b> the others having all been either conversions of, or extensions to, horse tram routes. Authorisation was given for the route to be continued to Mapperley, via The Wells Road, but, for the time being only as far as Coppice Road (now Ransom Road) was to be built. The construction of this line brought forth a protest from Bamford’s, the horse bus proprietors, alleging loss of receipts. Earlier in the year, shortly after the opening of the first electric car route, the Council had been asked if they would consider the purchase of Mann’s Omnibus, Horse and Carriage Company Limited, but this was not proceeded with.|$|E
