Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars. Indications of effects of wind, fluvial, glacial, mass wasting, meteor impact, tectonics and volcanic processes are studied.

50|$|The transdisciplinary {{field of}} {{ecological}} economics has embraced problem-based learning as a core pedagogy. A workbook developed by Joshua Farley, Jon Erickson, and Herman Daly organizes the problem-solving process into (1) building the problem base, (2) analyzing the problem, (3) synthesizing the findings, and (4) communicating the results. Building the problem base includes choosing, defining, and structuring an ecological economic problem. Analysis is breaking down {{of a problem}} into understandable components. Synthesis is the re-integration of the parts {{in a way that}} <b>helps</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the whole. Communication is the translation of results into a form relevant to stakeholders, broadly defined as the extended peer community.|$|E
50|$|Diffusion MRI {{measures}} {{the diffusion of}} water molecules in biological tissues. Clinically, diffusion MRI is useful for the diagnoses of conditions (e.g., stroke) or neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis), and <b>helps</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the connectivity of white matter axons in the central nervous system. In an isotropic medium (inside {{a glass of water}} for example), water molecules naturally move randomly according to turbulence and Brownian motion. In biological tissues however, where the Reynolds number is low enough for laminar flow, the diffusion may be anisotropic. For example, a molecule inside the axon of a neuron has a low probability of crossing the myelin membrane. Therefore, the molecule moves principally along the axis of the neural fiber. If it is known that molecules in a particular voxel diffuse principally in one direction, the assumption can be made {{that the majority of the}} fibers in this area are parallel to that direction.|$|E

Our findings point to the carbothermal reduction of SiO(2) in the CVD reaction. The inclusion of triethyl borate apparently accelerates the process and leads to improved yields.

40|$|International audienceAbstract This work {{focuses on}} the study of {{transient}} phenomena, in particular the non-uniformity and space-time variation of friction forces and surface temperature of a brake disc during stop-braking. Friction tests were conducted on a braking tribometer. The friction forces in the contact were measured using a 3 D piezoelectric sensor, while the disc surface temperature was investigated by means of a high frequency fibre-optic two-colour pyrometer. An optical lap-top device was used to keep track of disc revolutions, and an original programme was written to plot the space-time variations of the measured parameters. This new original approach <b>helps</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> the coupling between thermal and tribological phenomena occurring during braking...|$|E
40|$|To {{alleviate}} traffic congestion, {{a variety}} of route guidance strategies has been proposed for intelligent transportation systems. A number of the strategies are proposed and investigated on a symmetric two-route traffic system over the past decade. To evaluate the strategies in a more general scenario, this paper conducts eight prevalent strategies on a asymmetric two-route traffic network with different slowdown behaviors on alternative routes. The results show that only mean velocity feedback strategy is able to equalize travel time, i. e., approximate user optimality; while the others fail due to incapability of establishing relations between the feedback parameters and travel time. The paper <b>helps</b> <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> these strategies, and suggests mean velocity feedback strategy if the authority intends to achieve user optimality.
