Using the same primers (as used previously for F and HN gene amplification) and ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), the purified genomic DNAs were processed for sequencing reaction on a 3100 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). Each genomic fragment was sequenced twice in both forward and reverse directions to generate a reliable consensus sequence. The consensus sequences of F and HN genes of the study isolate (Pi/MZS 1 -UVAS/ 2014) has been submitted to GenBank under the accession number KU 644586 and KU 644587, respectively.|$|R
