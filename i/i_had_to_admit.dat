60|$|That was a puzzler, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it. I didn't {{know how}} much time had elapsed and neither did Perry, for time is nonexistent in Pellucidar.|$|E
60|$|And smooth! Polished glass {{could not}} be more so. Finally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that at last I had {{discovered}} a Barsoomian fortification which I could not negotiate.|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all, I {{denied the}} most {{damaging}} statement--that I {{knew nothing about the}} thing. It seemed necessary to prove the contrary, which I did, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the borrowing." ...|$|E
3000|$|... 1.)The GUI as {{such was}} not easy <b>to</b> {{understand}}. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> did not really understand what even half of the functions were displaying.|$|R
5000|$|Katherine Noyes, {{writing for}} PC World, noted [...] "As a {{longtime}} Ubuntu fan, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> I'm especially {{excited by the}} prospect of having my Ubuntu desktop available on my phone, wherever I go." ...|$|R
25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> like what he's doing.|$|R
60|$|I {{stroked the}} chin thoughtfully. There was, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> reason {{in what she}} said. None knew better than I how terrible a blow the passing of Anatole would be to Uncle Tom.|$|E
60|$|Then I set out {{to prove}} my point. I told him of our cities, of our army, of our great navy. He came right back at me asking for figures, {{and when he was}} done <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that only in our navy were we numerically superior.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{that this}} diminished {{the value of}} the experiment. [...] "But now listen," [...] I said: [...] "as we all seem to be {{suspicious}} of one another, I propose that we resort to a process of elimination. I shall take 'Mitchell's' advice and narrow the circle. Howard, you are a suspect. You are ruled out of the next sitting." ...|$|E
40|$|This is what I {{received}} from the Lord and passed on to you. " Sunday after Sunday, when {{the time for the}} gospel comes around, you stand up out of respect for the personal story about our Lord. Yet, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> you that all four writers of the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, were terribly inept reporters [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Henry Hanks of CNN {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and also stated [...] "This week, all three plots were equally strong, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> I'm {{really looking forward}} to next week's Halloween episode even more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Simmons told The Jewish Chronicle newspaper, [...] "It’s {{the best}} job in British quizzing and to get paid for doing {{something}} you love is just the icing on the cake. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> hate losing." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{all seemed}} rather callous to me. Nobody was much {{concerned}} {{for the man}} who was overboard somewhere on that lonely ocean. And yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that everything possible was being done to find him. I talked a little with Mr. Pike, and he seemed more vexed than anything else. He disliked to have the ship's work interrupted in such fashion.|$|E
60|$|I {{questioned}} Juag {{upon the}} feasibility of attempting to cross {{to the mouth of}} the great river of which he had told me, and up which he said we might paddle almost to Sari; but he urged me not to attempt it, since we had but a single paddle and no water or food. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the wisdom of his advice, but the desire to explore this great waterway was strong upon me, arousing in me at last a determination to make the attempt after first gaining the mainland and rectify-ing our deficiencies.|$|E
60|$|Sinister words, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> and I was not {{surprised}} that Aunt Dahlia, hearing them, should have uttered a cry like the wail of a master of hounds seeing a fox shot. Anatole had begun to wave his fists again at Gussie, and she now joined him. Seppings, who was puffing respectfully in the background, didn't actually wave his fists, but he gave Gussie a pretty austere look. It was plain to the thoughtful observer that this Fink-Nottle, in getting on to that skylight, had done a mistaken thing. He couldn't have been more unpopular {{in the home of}} G.G. Simmons.|$|E
60|$|From {{all that}} I can learn, few {{incidents}} worthy of remark {{happened in the}} voyage; and it mortifies me exceedingly that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> so noted an expedition into my work without making any more of it.|$|R
5000|$|... “As it was {{the first}} Iranian sound film to be {{presented}} abroad I felt it should present a bright picture of Iran... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the film was a great boost for the nationalistic pride of expatriate Iranians.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't impress people," [...] {{explained}} Colby, {{picking up}} the guitar again. [...] "I don't inspire confidence. As for the law, I know {{it as well as}} anyone--which is begging the question--but when I'm interviewed <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> I've <b>had</b> no experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{stopped at}} one o'clock {{and had a}} cold lunch, sitting in our wagon, while Peter Crow wakened up and watered the ponies. We did not get on so well in the afternoon. The trail descended into low-lying ground where {{travelling}} was very difficult. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> old Peter Crow was quite invaluable. He knew, as Kate had foretold, [...] "all the dry spots"--that is to say, spots less wet than others. But, even so, {{we had to make}} so many detours that by sunset we were little more than six miles distant from our noon halting place.|$|E
60|$|I {{lay in a}} hide chair {{ten hours}} {{together}} that Sunday, only moving to light the stove for Harry, or to consume another pint of strong green tea, which is generally our sole indulgence on the prairie. It might not, however, have suited fastidious palates, because the little squirrel-like gophers which abounded everywhere, burrowing near by, fell into the well by scores, {{and we had no}} leisure to fish them out. Neither is there any mistaking the flavor of gopher extract. Meantime it grew hotter and drier, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to myself that the crop might have been better, while Harry, to hide his misgivings, talked cheerfully about higher prices, until at last the crisis came.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to," [...] said Walters ruefully. [...] "I {{confined}} my answers as much {{as possible}} to 'Yes, sir,' and 'No,' but one can make a good deal out of these if the questions are judiciously framed. The bugler was killed, so they could learn nothing from him, but Watson was forced to declare that the order came from near the ravine where Blake should have fired the mine. After some badgering from the Colonel <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that that was my opinion. There were other points against Blake and he did not try to clear himself. It was a very bad business, and I remember that Challoner broke down after his examination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is best," [...] he said, at length, {{in a small}} voice. He {{turned to}} Mme. de Plougastel. [...] "If a wrong <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> in my life, a wrong that I must bitterly regret, it is the wrong that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done <b>to</b> you, my dear..." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor lit one himself, {{resting his}} arm {{on the edge}} of the chair. [...] "Corporal, you must realize that there are very few men who become plants, {{especially}} on such short notice. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> you are the first person who has ever told me such a thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Your map of Africa {{there is}} very nice <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> But you know, my map of Africa is here ... in Europe. You see here is Russia, over there is [...]. France. And us, we are here - {{right in the middle}} between those two. That's my map of Africa.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{went down}} the slope towards her I noticed she was tall--quite too tall for my taste. I dislike women who can look into my eyes on a level--but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that her form was remarkably {{symmetrical}} and graceful. She put out her hand--it was ungloved and large, but white and firm, with a cool, pleasant touch--and said, with a composure akin to indifference, [...] "Mr. Carslake, I presume. Mother could not come to meet you, so she sent me. Will you be kind enough to hold my horse for a few minutes? I want to get something in the store." [...] Whereupon she calmly transferred the reins to me and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{occasion}} {{when we first got}} on speaking terms on the road by the quarry, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that she presented some points of a problematic appearance. I don't know why I imagined Captain Anthony as the sort of man who would not be likely to take the initiative; not perhaps from indifference but from that peculiar timidity before women which often enough is found in conjunction with chivalrous instincts, with a great need for affection and great stability of feelings. Such men are easily moved. At the least encouragement they go forward with the eagerness, with the recklessness of starvation. This accounted for the suddenness of the affair. No! With all her inexperience this girl could not have found any great difficulty in her conquering enterprise. She must have begun it. And yet there she was, patient, almost unmoved, almost pitiful, waiting outside like a beggar, without a right to anything but compassion, for a promised dole.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must know," [...] he said, {{dropping}} cigarette ashes onto {{my pillow}} every minute, [...] "that {{some time ago}} I fell in with Jack Goring's father, Colonel Goring. Jack and I had been David and Jonathan at Cambridge, and though we had not met for years, I looked forward with pleasure to meeting him again. He was a widower, and his father and he kept joint house. But the house was dreary now, for the colonel was alone in it. Jack was off on a scientific expedition to the Pacific; all the girls {{had been married for}} years. After dinner my host and I had rather a dull hour in the smoking-room. I could not believe that Jack had grown very stout. 'I'll show you his photograph,' said the colonel. An album was brought down from a dusty shelf, and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that my old friend had become positively corpulent. But it is not Jack I want to speak about. I turned listlessly over the pages of the album, stopping suddenly at the face of a beautiful girl. You are not asleep, are you? ...|$|E
40|$|As a new {{contributor}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> {{got here}} by turnip truck (three decades of serious writing). But then I saw Word Ways, and the tail gate opened. Also the floor gate. With such endless wordplay possibilities, can even the veterans {{remember all the}} moves? And new comers certainly need an introduction...|$|R
60|$|Poppleton <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{known before}} slightly. I {{used to see}} him at the club. In club {{surroundings}} he always struck me as an ineffable young ass, loud and talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules. Yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that in his summer flannels and with a straw hat on he can do things that I can't.|$|R
5000|$|... "At least, that's {{the way it}} {{had been}} until Monty arrived, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> we all thought: Here we go again. We've heard it all before. But he and everybody else knew very well that this <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be the last stand. We were definitely in the Last Chance Saloon." [...] Quote from World War 2 diary extract ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{got up to}} go, {{and though}} I wanted her to succeed in not seeing Neil Paraday I wanted her also, inconsequently, {{to remain in the}} house. I was at any rate far from {{desiring}} to hustle her off. As Mrs. Weeks Wimbush, upstairs, was still saving our friend in her own way, I asked my young lady to let me briefly relate, in illustration of my point, the little incident of my having gone down into the country for a profane purpose and been converted on the spot to holiness. Sinking again into her chair to listen she showed a deep interest in the anecdote. Then thinking it over gravely she returned with her odd intonation: “Yes, but you do see him!” <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that this was the case; and I wasn’t so prepared with an effective attenuation as I could have wished. She eased the situation off, however, by the charming quaintness with which she finally said: “Well, I wouldn’t want him to be lonely!” This time she rose in earnest, but I persuaded her to let me keep the album to show Mr. Paraday. I assured her I’d bring it back to her myself. “Well, you’ll find my address somewhere in it on a paper!” she sighed all resignedly at the door.|$|E
60|$|When we topped a {{ridge of}} this slope the wind struck us {{strong in the}} face. The baying of the hounds rang clear and full and fierce. My horse stood {{straight}} up. Then he plunged back and bolted down the slope. His mouth was like iron. I could neither hold nor turn him. However perilous this ride <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that at last my horse was running beautifully. In fact he was running away! He had gotten a hot scent of that bear. He hurdled rocks, leaped washes, slid down banks, plunged over places that made my hair stand up stiff, {{and worst of all}} he did not try to avoid brush or trees or cactus. Manzanita he tore right through, leaving my coat in strips decorating our wake. I had to hold on, to lie flat, to dodge and twist, and all the time watch for a place where I might fall off in safety. But I did not get a chance to fall off. A loud clamoring burst from the hounds apparently close behind drove my horse frantic. Before he had only run--now he flew! He left me hanging in the thick branches of a juniper, from which I dropped blind and breathless and stunned. Disengaging myself from the broken and hanging branches I staggered aside, rifle in hand, trying to recover breath and wits.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{this very}} moment," [...] he went on, [...] "the most frightful horrors {{are taking place}} {{in every corner of}} the world. People are being crushed, slashed, disembowelled, mangled; their dead bodies rot and their eyes decay with the rest. Screams of pain and fear go pulsing through the air at the rate of eleven hundred feet per second. After {{travelling}} for three seconds they are perfectly inaudible. These are distressing facts; but do we enjoy life any the less because of them? Most certainly we do not. We feel sympathy, no doubt; we represent to ourselves imaginatively the sufferings of nations and individuals and we deplore them. But, after all, what are sympathy and imagination? Precious little, unless the person for whom we feel sympathy happens to be closely involved in our affections; and even then they don't go very far. And a good thing too; for if one had an imagination vivid enough and a sympathy sufficiently sensitive really to comprehend and to feel the sufferings of other people, one would never have a moment's peace of mind. A really sympathetic race would not so much as know the meaning of happiness. But luckily, as I've already said, we aren't a sympathetic race. At {{the beginning of the war}} I used to think I really suffered, through imagination and sympathy, with those who physically suffered. But after a month or two <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that, honestly, I didn't. And yet I think I have a more vivid imagination than most. One is always alone in suffering; the fact is depressing when one happens to be the sufferer, but it makes pleasure possible for the rest of the world." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even the gentlemanly Walker {{also made}} rare scathing {{comments}} on Jarier's driving, he said [...] "In {{all my years}} as a commentator, but certainly no driver, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> that was an awful and crass piece of driving by Jarier." [...] At {{this point in the}} season, in terms of his Formula One status, Jarier was at the point of no return.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several weeks, I’ve been busily working on a session I’m {{presenting}} on obesity and breastfeeding at this year’s ILCA conference. To prepare myself, I’ve been working my way through a large pile of books and articles. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> I’ve been getting some funny looks from recent house guests. They are naturally curious about why I am reading books with titles like...|$|R
5000|$|... "In retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> {{think the}} critiques are largely correct," [...] he said. [...] "The {{findings}} {{can be considered}} evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more." [...] He said he spoke with {{the editor of the}} Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined. (Repeated attempts to contact the journal went unanswered.) ...|$|R
