5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{suggestions}} in the Post Office advertisement, the essays that National Banknote Company submitted for the new issue on July 22, 1869, indeed represented a fresh approach. Six of the designs (1¢, 2¢, 3¢, 12¢, 15¢ and 24¢) were accepted with few alterations (most of the changes involved making the numerals larger—- which, on some values, was not an aesthetic improvement). The remaining essays were {{quite different from the}} stamps ultimately issued. One interesting feature is that this July 22 version of the series placed Washington on two denominations—- not a surprising duplication, given that so many Washington stamps had been included in the two previous definitive series. National submitted both five-cent and ninety-cent Washington essays. A five-cent stamp had been included in both preceding series, but this denomination was discarded late in the production of the pictorials in favor of a more useful six-cent value (easily created by revamping the five-cent Washington design). This was the first six-cent stamp ever issued by the U.S. Post Office. The ninety-cent essay uses the same Washington image that had been employed for the 90-cent Washington stamp from 1861, and it places this portrait in the same frame that would later enclose Lincoln in the 1869 issue's final version.The July essays assigned Lincoln to the 10-cent value, while the 15- and 24-cent tableaux were accompanied by a third historical scene for the 30-cent denomination, drawn from John Trumbull's painting The Surrender of General Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga (this design was never produced in two colors, but has been conjecturally colorized here in the approximate shades of the 30-cent stamp that was issued). After Lincoln had been moved to the 90-cent stamp, a 10-cent version of the Signing of the Declaration was mooted, but around September, National provided the present Eagle-and-Shield design for the denomination. Late in production, the Post Office eliminated the Burgoyne stamp, fearing it would offend the British. The resulting vacancy in the series was filled by an ingenious adaptation of the Eagle and Shield: this tableau appears in red on 30-cent value, framed by flags, stars and <b>halations</b> of light printed in blue (while the flags are monocolored, the general red, white and blue impression of the stamp as a whole carries over to them). Many years later, during 1927, another engraving of Trumbull's painting would appear on a [...] (prompting no British objection); and during 1994 the original Burgoyne 1869 tableau was finally issued on a stamp in a replica, printed entirely in blue but now somewhat enlarged in size and valued one dollar rather than the original 30-cents. The Postal Service labeled this stamp [...] "The Battle of Saratoga", downplaying the tableau's aspect as an image of English defeat.|$|R

Unsharp masking uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference.

5000|$|Dot gain {{is caused}} by ink {{spreading}} around halftone dots. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called [...] "rimming". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing). Finally, <b>halation</b> of the printing film during exposure can contribute to dot gain.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{xerography}} and {{inkjet printing}} employ a halftone process and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, {{rather than the}} small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, posterization and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight <b>halation</b> of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high end equipment have true continuous tones not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations).|$|E
50|$|To {{create the}} Autochrome color filter mosaic, a thin glass plate was first {{coated with a}} {{transparent}} adhesive layer. The dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye. They were then spread onto the adhesive, creating a layer with approximately 4,000,000 grains per square inch but only one grain thick. The exact means by which significant gaps and overlapping grains were avoided still remains unclear. It {{was found that the}} application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion, because the grains would be flattened slightly, making them more transparent, and pressed into more intimate contact with each other, reducing wasted space between them. As it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once, a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time. Lampblack was used to block up the slight spaces that remained. The plate was then coated with shellac to protect the moisture-vulnerable grains and dyes from the water-based gelatin emulsion, which was coated onto the plate after the shellac had dried. The resulting finished plate was cut up into smaller plates of the desired size, which were packaged in boxes of four. Each plate was accompanied by a thin piece of cardboard colored black on the side facing the emulsion. This was to be retained when loading and exposing the plate and served both to protect the delicate emulsion and to inhibit <b>halation.</b>|$|E

Moreover, a trancient increase in arterial oxygen tension, a decrease in carbon dioxide tension and an increase in pH were observed following inhalation of higher 1, 1, 1 -TCE concentrations in spontaneous breathing. However, oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension and pH remained unchanged following inhalation in artificial breathing.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the phosphorescence properties of liquid and vapour acetone is presented {{with the goal of}} introducing a novel technique for improved two-phase flow visualization. Commonly applied laser induced fluorescence (LIF) investigations of two-phase flows are challenging, in particular because of the large disparity in fluorescence intensity between the two phases and the ensuing effect of <b>halation</b> around the liquid droplets. The phosphorescence properties of liquid and gaseous acetone are utilized in order to decrease this disparity and acquire more quantitative images of the vapour phase surrounding the droplets. For this purpose, the phosphorescence lifetimes of acetone vapour in air and nitrogen bath gas, {{as well as those of}} liquid acetone was investigated. A 308 nm XeCl excimer laser was used as the excitation source. Acetone vapour in air does not emit phosphorescence due to strong oxygen quenching; however, in nitrogen, a slowly decaying signal with a lifetime of around 920 ns is observed. Liquid acetone phosphorescence is strongly affected by self-quenching, as well as the amount of oxygen dissolved in it. The phosphorescence lifetime of liquid acetone that has been exposed to ambient air for a prolonged period of time is around 73 ns. When, instead, liquid acetone is degassed (purged with nitrogen in order to remove any dissolved oxygen), its lifetime increases to 213 ns. Introducing liquid acetone that has not been previously purged in a nitrogen atmosphere allows for the on-going diffusion of oxygen out of the liquid to be directly imaged. The phosphorescence intensity varies depending on the degree of oxygen diffusion out of the liquid and thus, a well-defined condition required for two-phase flow imaging is only achieved for the degassed liquid acetone in nitrogen case. Direct comparison of the phosphorescence intensities of liquid and vapour acetone along with their respective decays has revealed the potential to optimize the disparity between the two signals for two-phase flow imaging. In order to examine the effectiveness of visualizing the phosphorescence rather the fluorescence, experiments with an acetone droplet stream were conducted in different environments. The phosphorescence images allow for the liquid-vapour interface to be accurately located and for the vapour phase to be clearly visible in contrast to standard LIF images, which show strong <b>halation</b> around the droplets resulting in both an apparent increase in the spatial extent of the droplets and an over-prediction of the vapour phase concentration near the interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a camera-based position measurement system for automatic tracking {{control of a}} rubber Tired Gantry Crane (RTGC). An automatic tracking control of RTGC depends {{on the ability to}} measure its displacement and angle from a guide line that the RTGC has to follow. The measurement system proposed in this paper is composed of a camera and a PC that are mounted on the right upper between front and rear tires of the RTGC’s side. The measurement accuracy of the system is affected by disturbances such as cracks and stains of the guide line, shadows, and <b>halation</b> from the light fluctuation. To overcome the disturbances, both side edges of the guide line are detected as two straight lines from an input image taken by the camera, and parameters of the straight lines are determined by using Hough transform. The displacement and angle of the RTGC from the guide line can be obtained from these parameters with the robustness against the disturbances. From the experiments with the disturbances, we found the accurate displacement and the angle from the guide line that have the standard deviations of 0. 95 pixels and 0. 22 degrees, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Histochemical, biochemical, and {{electron}} microscopic investigations on resected specimen {{have expanded}} in almost exponential manner {{in the past}} ten years and taking photograph of the specimens is also of importance for the examination of them. The specimens are, however, damaged during the time of taking photograph by various factors such as heat, dryness, light etc. For the investigations of this kind, the most important requirement for preservation of protoplasmic structure is to interrupt the dynamic process of the cell as prompt as possible and to stabilize the structure with a minimum of change. To prevent the damage of the specimens during the time of taking photograph, the following procedure is proposed: The specimen is dipped into cold saline solution, phosphate buffer, or cacodylate buffer. as soon as possible after operation. Photographic procedure is carried out upon the specimen dipped into the solution. By this procedure, the specimens can be protected from being damaged by heating and drying. Furthermore, the specimen can be preserved in its original shape due to the aid of buoyancy.

40|$|The {{prospects}} of utilising the laser induced phosphorescence emission of common ketone tracers {{in the study}} of multi-phase (gas-liquid) flows are investigated within the context of this thesis. The quantification of evaporated fuel concentrations in the vicinity of liquid droplets by means of the laser induced fluorescence imaging technique, and the measurement of fuel concentrations in sprays containing sub-pixel sized droplets by means of the laser induced exciplex imaging technique suffer from well-known limitations; the former is plagued by low vapour phase signal intensities and <b>halation,</b> and the latter by liquid-vapour crosstalk and quenching. Therefore, a literature research was initially carried out, focusing on two main topics: the underlying photophysics of the processes involved in the excitation and deexcitation mechanism of the tracers under investigation, and the relevant optical techniques available for carrying out vaporized fuel concentration measurements in two-phase flow environments. Following a description of the experimental apparatus, a series of calibration experiments is presented. The liquid phase phosphorescence properties of acetone and 3 -pentanone were investigated in the bulk and in liquid streams, and the phosphorescence emission characteristics of both tracers were quantified for different bath gas compositions. The phosphorescence signal of gaseous acetone was calibrated for the excitation energy and concentration dependencies. Based on the calibration data, a new technique was developed for the purpose of investigating the vapour phase concentration in the vicinity of liquid droplets. The proposed technique utilizes the phosphorescence rather than the fluorescence emission of vapour and liquid acetone, and is compared with the well-established laser induced fluorescence technique (LIF), in both evaporative and non-evaporative monodisperse droplet streams. The obtained results suggest that laser induced phosphorescence (LIP) imaging clearly improves upon laser induced fluorescence imaging, by successfully addressing both the high signal intensity disparity between the two phases and the ensuing <b>halation</b> that plague measurements carried out by deployment of LIF. The fluorescence and phosphorescence emission of acetone and 3 -pentanone, the latter considered in order to demonstrate the feasibility of LIP imaging by deployment of other common ketone tracers apart from acetone, were also examined in sprays by means of a high-pressure gasoline direct injection system. Experiments examining the emission from both electronic states and their potential correlation are presented for non-evaporative sprays.; in particular, liquid phase corrections are carried out in LIF images by deployment of their corresponding LIP images and the obtained correlation functions, and the ensuing errors are quantified. Finally, mean and median filters are employed in limiting these errors and assessing the feasibility of the proposed technique. The obtained results are rendered encouraging, with suggestions for improvement focusing on reducing the noise observed in the LIP images by both signal augmentation and enhancement in the efficiency of the collection optics.

One group (n = 16) was randomized to budesonide treatment, 400 mu g three times daily; the other group (n = 14) to placebo. PC 20 and FEV(1) were measured 10, 14, 34, and 82 h after the last terbutaline or placebo in <b>halation.</b> A different meth od of statistical analysis was used, in that measurements performed at 10, 14, and 34 h were expressed relative to 82 h values in each period as an area-under-the-curve (AUG) value. FEV(1) did not significantly change during placebo and budesonide treatment. Mean PC 20 and morning and evening peak expiratory flow were significantly higher during budesonide treatment (p < 0. 01).
