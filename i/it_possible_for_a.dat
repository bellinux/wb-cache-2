5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

25|$|Touchpads are {{primarily}} used in self-contained portable laptop computers {{and do not}} require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad {{is close to the}} keyboard, and only very short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> user's palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes integrated in some desktop computer keyboards, particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.|$|E
25|$|The Perspectives Project {{operates}} network notaries {{that clients}} {{can use to}} detect if a site's certificate has changed. By their nature, man-in-the-middle attacks place the attacker between the destination and a single specific target. As such, Perspectives would warn the target that the certificate delivered to the web browser does not match the certificate seen from other perspectives – the perspectives of other users in different times and places. Use of network notaries from a multitude of perspectives makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> target to detect an attack even if a certificate appears to be completely valid.|$|E

50|$|In Minkowski space {{there is}} only one time-like {{geodesic}} that connects any given pair of time-like separated events, and that geodesic is the curve with the longest proper time between the two events. But in curved spacetime, <b>it's</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pair of widely separated events to have more than one time-like geodesic that connects them. In such instances, the proper times along the various geodesics will not in general be the same. And for some geodesics in such instances, <b>it's</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> curve that connects the two events and is nearby to the geodesic to have either a longer or a shorter proper time than the geodesic.|$|R

25|$|The {{complete}} technical {{disclosure of}} the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark, Rene' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 made <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great variety of record companies {{to get into the}} business of making long playing records. The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished.|$|E
25|$|At Fort Necessity, the {{provision}} hut was depleted, {{and there was}} little shelter from the heavy rain that started to fall on the 2nd. With the rain, the trenches that Washington had ordered to be dug had turned into streams. Washington realized {{that he would have}} to defend against a frontal assault and also realized that it would be difficult because the woods were less than 100 yards away, within musket range, making <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> besieging attacker to pick off the defenders. To improve the defense, Washington ordered his men to cut trees down and to make them into makeshift breastworks.|$|E

Larger image and video previews were displayed in a tooltip when the mouse hovered over a file, column-level filtering of results was introduced, and overall performance of Explorer was somewhat improved over build 4015, though the memory leak issues were not entirely resolved. There was also a new analog clock user interface.

25|$|In the 1860s, {{the advent}} of {{electric}} motors made <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> gyroscope to spin indefinitely; {{this led to the}} first prototype heading indicators, and a rather more complicated device, the gyrocompass. The first functional gyrocompass was patented in 1904 by German inventor Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe. American Elmer Sperry followed with his own design later that year, and other nations soon realized the military importance of the inventionin an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military powerand created their own gyroscope industries. The Sperry Gyroscope Company quickly expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well, and other gyroscope developers followed suit.|$|E
25|$|Abu Rayhan Biruni (973–1048) used a {{new method}} to {{accurately}} compute the Earth's circumference, {{by which he}} arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference. His estimate of 6,339.6km for the Earth radius was only 31.4km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0km. In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single person to measure it from a single location.|$|E
25|$|Many facilitative {{interactions}} {{directly affect}} {{the distribution of}} species. As discussed above, transport of plant propagules by animal dispersers can increase colonization rates of more distant sites, which may impact the distribution and population dynamics of the plant species. Facilitation most often affects distribution by simply making <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> species to occur in a site where some environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth of that species. This is apparent in whole-community facilitation by a foundation species, such as sediment stabilization in cobble beach plant communities by smooth cordgrass. A facilitating species may also help drive the progression from one ecosystem type to another, as mesquite apparently does in the grasslands of the Rio Grande Plains. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, mesquite establishes more readily than other species on nutrient-poor soils, and following establishment, mesquite acts as a nurse plant for seedlings of other species. Thus, mesquite facilitates the dynamic spatial shift from grassland to savanna to woodland across the habitat.|$|E

500|$|Many {{have the}} custom {{to have high}} quality tefillin and {{beautiful}} tefillin bags as a Hiddur Mitzvah. [...] This idea comes from the verse [...] "This is my God and I will glorify Him" [...] (Exodus 15:2). [...] The Jewish Sages explain: [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> human being to add glory to his Creator? What this really means is: I shall glorify Him in the way I perform mitzvot.

500|$|One such {{relationship}} was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: [...] "Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... I {{put in your}} lovers, for I don't allow <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man to be so sincere as I am." [...] Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who {{was the subject of}} many of Seward's sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward's protest, Seward's poems became angry. However, Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd's beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, [...] "The roses will bloom when there's peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know not how I love her." [...] Wollstonecraft's first novel , in part, addressed her relationship with Fanny Blood.|$|E
