50|$|The lack of {{complete}} information {{raises a question}} of when the <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculation</b> should be made. Should the efficiency check be made at the ex ante stage before the agent sees their types, at the interim stage after the agent sees their types, or at the ex post stage where the agent will have complete information about their types? Another issue is incentive. If a resource allocation rule is efficient {{but there is no}} incentive to abide by that rule or accept that rule, then the revelation principle asserts that there is no mechanism by which this allocation rule can be realized.|$|E
50|$|Flue gas {{condensation}} {{may cause}} the heat recovered {{to exceed the}} Lower Heating Value of the input fuel, and thus an efficiency greater than 100%. Since historically most combustion processes have not condensed the fuel, usual <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculations</b> assume the combustion products are not condensed. This assumption is implicit when basing calculations on the Lower Heating Value. A more rigorous approach would be to base <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculations</b> on the Higher Heating Value, which typically results in efficiencies less than 100%.|$|R

A method for correcting for the sampling scheme in analysis of ascertainment samples is also presented.

50|$|The {{nomination}} of Pasing {{as a city}} in 1905 {{is the beginning of}} the history of Pasing Viktualenmarkt. The city council decided to establish a market for vegetables, fruits and plants on 9 July 1906. It was decided to hold the market at the south-western corner of the Pasing Marienplatz opposite the Institut der Englischen Fräulein. In January 1907 the Royal Government of Upper Bavaria granted permission for this. The layout of the market turned out to be something of a problem as everyone built their stalls in the way they wanted. Ultimately they came to terms and the first market day was held on 16 March 1907.From the beginning the market was well accepted, but the customers were only people from Pasing so that an <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculation</b> was carried out in 1908. This showed that the Viktualienmarkt in Pasing was not really profitable. The reason for this was that itinerant traders sold their goods more cheaply at the verge of the market as they did not have to pay a fee. This problem was solved by changing the market regulations.|$|E

In order to carry out scientific EPP investment decisions, the level of energy efficiency is an important basis for investment decisions. This paper introduces total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) in energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculation</b> of EPP, constructs energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>calculation</b> model considering environmental benefits, and takes the micro and macro cases in China for analysis; the results show that the TFEE of both single energy efficiency project and EPP are at a relatively high level (above 0. 7), and there is a huge gap between calculation results considering and without considering the environmental benefit. In order to discuss energy efficiency influencing factors, the paper analyzes generalized technological advances variation feature of China typical provinces implementing EPP based on generalized technological advances decomposition model by Malmquist index, finding that the steady growth of M index in these provinces is derived from the management level of implementation of EPP and the large-scale production capacity of formation and management.
