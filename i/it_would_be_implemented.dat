25|$|Nkrumah's {{title was}} Leader of Government Business in a cabinet chaired by Arden-Clarke. Quick {{progress}} was made, and in 1952, the governor {{withdrew from the}} cabinet, leaving Nkrumah as his prime minister, with the portfolios that had been reserved for expatriates going to Africans. There were accusations of corruption, and of nepotism, as officials, following African custom, attempted to benefit their extended families and their tribes. The recommendations following the 1948 riots had included elected local government rather than the existing system dominated by the chiefs. This was uncontroversial until {{it became clear that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> by the CPP. That party's majority in the Legislative Assembly passed legislation in late 1951 that shifted power from the chiefs to the chairs of the councils, though there was some local rioting as rates were imposed.|$|E
500|$|NCL first {{announced}} a new Castlevania for the DS on October 5, 2005. [...] Details of the game were not released until April 21, 2006, when Konami revealed the game's title and its World War II setting. On May 9, 2006, the official trailer was shown at Konami's official press conference. [...] The trailer showcased the smooth player switching and combinations of Jonathan and Charlotte's abilities. [...] In an interview with producer Koji Igarashi in June 2006, it was revealed the game would try to utilize the touch screen better than Dawn of Sorrow. [...] He also mentioned {{he was thinking of}} incorporating cooperative game play in an unlockable stage via WiFi. [...] More information concerning online game play were released a month later at Comic-Con 2006, but details on how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> were still unconfirmed. [...] At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, Igarashi confirmed details about the WiFi modes and stated Portrait of Ruin would have a cooperative time attack and an online shop mode.|$|E

The tool works by comparing a website's traffic against a database of known backdoors. Later that year, the company announced Login-Protect, a two factor authentication feature as an integrated addition to its products. Incapsula also announced in 2013 that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implementing</b> Layer 7 load balancing capabilities.|$|R

The project involves {{the construction of a}} HVDC connection between Madurai in southern India, and Anuradhapura in central Sri Lanka, through the Palk Strait. The link would measure 285 km in length, including 50 km of submarine cables, and would take more than three years to construct. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Ceylon Electricity Board.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{said that}} all {{unmarried}} couples, both same-sex and opposite-sex, and their children that are receiving domestic-partner benefits as public employees {{would no longer be}} eligible for those benefits under this amendment. The second sentence in the amendment sought to address this issue by continuing to allow private-party contracts between employees and employers. For example, a private company could agree to extend health benefits to employees and their partners. However, since [...] "domestic legal union" [...] was untested language in the courts, the issue was considered likely to face litigation to determine what the actual meaning would be and how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E

The airline stated that up to 100 redundancies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed, but this was later revised to 70 which would represent a 20% reduction of staff. The airline's key routes were to remain unchanged.|$|R

Israel's collaboration with Apartheid South Africa was mentioned and condemned by various international organizations like the UN General Assembly (several times since 1974). In 1987 Israel announced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implementing</b> sanctions against South Africa.

On July 26, 2017, President Donald Trump announced the reinstatement of the ban on service by transgender individuals through a series of posts on his Twitter page, though he did not announce how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> or what would happen to openly transgender personnel.

50|$|This was {{the crucial}} turning point: the {{industry}} as a whole was no longer content to let IBM make all the major decisions about technical direction. In the event, the new EISA bus was itself a commercial failure beyond the high end: By the time the cost of implementing EISA was reduced to the extent that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in most desktop PCs, the much cheaper VESA Local Bus had removed most of the need for it in desktop PCs (though it remained common in servers due to for example the possibility of data corruption on hard disk drives attached to VLB controllers), and Intel's PCI bus was just around the corner. But although very few EISA systems were sold, it had achieved its purpose: IBM no longer controlled the computer industry. IBM would belatedly amend the PS/2 series with the PS/ValuePoint line, which tracked the features of the emerging ad hoc platform.|$|E

40|$|Introspection is {{the process}} of {{thinking}} about one's own thoughts and feelings. In this paper, I discuss recent attempts to make computational systems that exhibit introspective behavior: [Smith, 982], [Weyhrauch, 1978], and [Doyle, 1980]. Each presents a system capable of manipulating representations of its own program and current context. I argue that introspective ability is crucial for intelligent systems ??thout it an agent cannot represent certain problems that it must be able to solve. A theory of intelligent action would describe how and why certain actions intelligently achieve an agent's goals. The agent would both embody and represent this theory; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> as the program for the agent; and the importance of introspection suggests that the agent represent its theory of action to itself...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Knowledge {{management}} {{needs to}} consider the three related elements of people, processes and technology. Much existing work has concentrated on either people or technology, often {{to the exclusion of}} the other two elements. Yet without thinking about process – the way people, organisations and even technology actually do things – any implementation of a knowledge management initiative is at best risky, and at worst doomed to failure. This paper looks at various ways in which a process view has appeared, explicitly or implicitly, in knowledge management research and practice so far, and reflects on how more “thinking about process ” might improve knowledge management in the future. Consistent with this overall viewpoint, the issues generally centre less on what a process view would suggest should be done, but rather on the way that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in practice...|$|E

As a way of curtailing the redundant charging phenomenon, which is widespread, we have suggested that the courts develop a law of counts to cabin prosecutorial charging discretion. Thus, our proposal to create a law of counts would not require prosecutors to act against their short- or long-term interests.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore the role {{preservation}} planning can potentially have in a favela, or Brazilian self-built settlement, given the interventions {{taking place in the}} name of urban upgrading, tourism, and heritage designation. A general background is given for where the study is regionally focused - in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Case studies, which entail investigation of local and institutional perspectives, are conducted within the communities of Morro da Providência and Santa Marta. The objectives in this research are: to consider significance in these favelas from the points of view of ‘outsiders’ and ‘insiders’; to gauge the benefits and costs resulting from interventions; and to determine if preservation planning is possible and desirable, and thus a necessary intervention, how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented,</b> and by whom. Through this process, I explore the boundaries of preservation planning so that it may become more relevant to planning practices in the broader vision of peaceful and sustainable development...|$|E

Unfortunately hardware circuits are inherently inflexible. The software implementation of Boolean functions, called programmed logic, is much more flexible. Programmed logic uses a processor with memory for a program, memory for data and I/O interfaces, also called a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Simply put a PLC reads its input, applies certain functions and finally writes the output.
