In 1981, an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen <b>ice</b> <b>factory</b> was affected by a chemical incident in 1989. A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993.

25|$|The Grimsby <b>Ice</b> <b>Factory</b> is {{a former}} <b>ice</b> <b>factory</b> located in Grimsby, England that was {{constructed}} from 1898–1901 to provide crushed ice to preserve fish stored in ships at Grimsby's seaport. The Grimsby <b>Ice</b> <b>Factory</b> engaged in operations up to 1990. The buildings still contain some of the original historic machinery from times of the operations' origins. During its time of prime operations, it produced 1,200 tonnes of ice daily. The building is 4,350 square metres in size, and at one time {{it was the largest}} <b>ice</b> <b>factory</b> in the world. The building is deteriorating, and it has been stated that it will eventually crumble if restoration efforts are not undertaken. Furthermore, historic machinery at the site is at risk from exposure to the elements, because the roof is not watertight.|$|E

25|$|Although {{traces of}} the canal through Derby city centre {{remained}} {{until well into the}} twentieth century (the <b>ice</b> <b>factory</b> on what was the Cockpit island drew its water from the canal), it has all been covered by development, mainly the inner ring road and Pride Parkway.

25|$|In March 2015, Grimsby {{residents}} {{suggested that}} the factory be covered to hide it from view during the upcoming World Seafood Congress event in September, with the rationale that the deteriorating building could denigrate the town's image. Graeme Bassett, secretary of the Great Grimsby <b>Ice</b> <b>Factory</b> Trust, {{suggested that the}} building could be covered temporarily or that scaffolding could be erected as a solution regarding concerns about the site being an eyesore.|$|E
25|$|The site {{is managed}} {{in part by}} the Great Grimsby <b>Ice</b> <b>Factory</b> Trust.

2500|$|The {{economy of}} Lexington, Kentucky {{was shaped by}} its {{considerable}} distance from any major navigable rivers. As a landlocked city, it did not develop the heavy industry that often developed in cities like Cincinnati or Pittsburgh. To counter this, Lexington put forth an effort {{to stay at the}} forefront of modern technology in an effort to attract a diverse light industrial and commercial base. For instance, the city was the first in Kentucky to have street lights, one of the first with a police force, and strict regulations on agriculture within the city. Lexington was also proud to boast its urban sewer system and its network of sidewalks, all of this by the early 1880s. Other infrastructure improvements were to come in the latter 1880s, including telephone lines, street railways, and a new <b>ice</b> <b>factory.</b> These improvements helped solidify Lexington's position as the [...] "agricultural and manufacturing keystone" [...] for the region.|$|E

50|$|Another cause, or {{at least}} threat, of ice famine was World War One. During the war, the American {{government}} needed most of the country’s supply of ammonia. Ammonia was a chemical used in <b>ice</b> <b>factories</b> that helped make the ice and also refrigerated the ice until it was ready for consumption, but Americans' need for ice was considered insignificant when the American Government {{wanted to go to}} war. The government ultimately needed the ammonia to provide soldiers with sufficient ammunition to fight the war. Since a majority of the ammonia supply was fueling war efforts, <b>ice</b> <b>factories</b> could not generate nearly enough ice to meet demand. This caused the countryside and cities, especially New York City, to have small quantities of ice and no ice at all in some areas. In order to help the American people out of the ice famine, The Department of Agriculture released plans to the public that described how to make, and effectively use, a homemade refrigeration unit.|$|R
