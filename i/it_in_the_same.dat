5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{earned it}} the 1999 BCS {{national}} championship {{and brought the}} Seminoles' season to an end with an undefeated 120 record. By beginning the season at No.1 and ending <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position, Florida State became the first college football team to stay ranked No.1 for every {{week of the season}} after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Virginia Tech's loss brought it to a final record of 111, but the Hokies still completed their first 11-win season in school history. The 75total points scored in the 2000 Sugar Bowl were a Sugar Bowl record at that point in the game's history.|$|E
5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys {{granted the}} manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with her}} heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still holding it in 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but the manor of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who held it in 1428.|$|E

5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the earliest fragmentary remains that will {{come to be known as}} Deinosuchus, it was found that it was a relative of crocodiles, going as far as placing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> family (crocodylidae) in 1954, this assignment was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia helped place Deinosuchus in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with Leidyosuchus. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by {{the discovery}} of a well-preserved Deinosuchus brain case from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, Deinosuchus however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.|$|E

5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.|$|E

25|$|The Chapel of Christ Crucified (Capela do Senhor Jesus Crucificado) was {{constructed}} in 1589, according to a date {{on the front of}} the arch over <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area are two Renaissance medallions showing the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul.

The central area is filled by pictures of Our Lady of Sorrows and of St. John the Evangelist, and by the large sculpture of Christ Crucified.

25|$|Lesya, {{according}} to the Jain theory of karma, is the coloring of the soul on account its association with the karmic matter. The colour of leśyā varies {{from person to person}} depending on the psychic states and mental activities behind an action. The coloring of the soul is explained through the analogy of crystal, that acquires the color of the matter associated with <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, the soul reflects the qualities of colour, taste, smell and touch of associated karmic matter, although it is usually the colour that is referred to when discussing the leśyās. Paul Dundas notes the key text expressing this Jain doctrine, explaining how the literary form of the text is helpful in dating and reconstructing the history of transmission.|$|E

25|$|Spielrein {{completed}} her medical school dissertation, supervised first by Bleuler then by Jung, on a close {{study of the}} language of a patient with schizophrenia.

Her dissertation contributed greatly to the understanding {{of the language of}} people with schizophrenia. Because her study was one of the first to focus on schizophrenia, the need for more research began and led to more people focusing on the mental illness. It was also the first dissertation written by a woman that was psychoanalytically oriented. She left Zurich the day after her graduation, having resolved to establish an independent career as a psychoanalyst elsewhere.|$|E
