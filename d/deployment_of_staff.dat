While both Egypt and Algeria had identified staff for the two elements, these countries were yet to sign the hosting agreement with Libya, and in some cases the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> was constrained by domestic considerations including promotions and retirements.

Recent Government actions to build political consensus on issues critical to reform have created a climate that is ripe for change. The Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) acts as a champion for reform. The Minister, appointed in 1997, quickly established a committee for the reform of higher education (known as the HEEP Committee) which drew {{in a wide range of}} stakeholders including industrialists and parliamentarians. A National Conference on higher education reform was held in February 2000, and a Declaration for action emanating from the Conference was endorsed by the President and the Prime Minister.

The management of penetrating trauma is not as demanding as that of blunt trauma, yet the sheer number of cases, over the past four decades, has imposed a clinical burden that has never been met by commensurate resources. The organisation of the hospital and departmental responses has manifested itself on two different levels. The first one is the structural and functional <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> insufficient <b>staff,</b> facilities and equipment to cope as flexibly as possible with the trauma epidemic.

The presentation reflected on research carried out during 2002 - 06 on the development and <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> part-time <b>staff</b> in the Learning and Skills Sector. Although the lifelong learning sector is the largest UK education sector, little attention has as yet been paid to the role of LSC sector part-time <b>staff.</b> Worrying trends <b>of</b> an increasing casualisation <b>of</b> <b>staffing</b> have been reported. The role of part-timers as highly committed (philanthropic) but generally underpaid and exploited staff (ragged-trousered) emerged from the data collected by this investigation, which examined the role of part-timers in several colleges and adult education institutions in London and the South East. The metaphor of the 'ragged-trousered philanthropist' was consciously selected to investigate the interactivity between philantrophy, employment practices for PT staff, and education as social action, in addressing the need for good practice to achieve quality outcomes in learning and teaching. The results are to some extent transferable to other education and training sectors employing part-time staff, e. g. higher education institutions and work-based training organisations...|$|R

30|$|Rapid {{sequence}} {{spinal anesthesia}} (RSS) is a recently developed technique {{for the most}} urgent cesarean section, category- 1 in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline, where general anesthesia has extensively been performed [1 – 3]. In terms of safety of anesthesia, {{if we do not}} have to think about time constraints, spinal anesthesia is basically safer, and RSS is designed to satisfy also the time constraints. Different from spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean section, RSS is characterized by specific anesthetic procedure including the methods of sterilization, dose of anesthetics, required level of spinal anesthesia before starting surgery for shortening the decision-delivery interval [1, 2]. However, it is important to note that successful RSS requires effective <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>staffs</b> and teamwork, as suggested by Kinsella [1]. We recently created a local protocol of RSS in our hospital after multi-disciplinarily discussion, and performed its simulation, which significantly contributed to perform RSS successfully for category- 1 cesarean section.|$|R
