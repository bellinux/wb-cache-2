40|$|International audienceThe {{currently}} adopted {{approach to}} avalanche hazard mapping in northern Italy includes avalanche dynamic modelling, coupled with {{statistical analysis of}} snow <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> avalanche <b>start.</b> The 30 -years and 300 -years return period avalanches at a given site are modelled and their run out zone and pressure are evaluated. The snow depth in the avalanche release zone is assumed {{to coincide with the}} three days snow fall depth H 72 featuring a return period of 30 years and 300 years, respectively. In the Italian alps only short series of observed snow depth are available, covering a period of 20 years or so, thus requiring a regional approach, or index value approach for the purpose of high return period quantile estimation. Based of former studies, here we apply the index value approach developed for the Lombardia region, in northern Italy, for hazard mapping in a particular avalanche site. A dynamic avalanche model is tuned using the runout data for two major observed avalanche events. Then, the 30 -years and 300 -years runout zone and dynamic pressure are calculated. It is then shown that the obtained hazard maps are more accurate than those obtained using the evaluation of H 72 as deduced from distribution fitting in a single site...|$|R
2500|$|The lysocline {{marks the}} <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> which {{carbonate}} <b>starts</b> to dissolve (above the lysocline, carbonate is oversaturated): today, {{this is at}} about 4km, comparable to the median depth of the oceans. This depth depends on (among other things) temperature {{and the amount of}} [...] dissolved in the ocean. Adding [...] initially shallows the lysocline, resulting in the dissolution of deep water carbonates. This deep-water acidification can be observed in ocean cores, which show (where bioturbation has not destroyed the signal) an abrupt change from grey carbonate ooze to red clays (followed by a gradual grading back to grey). It is far more pronounced in north Atlantic cores than elsewhere, suggesting that acidification was more concentrated here, related to a greater rise in the level of the lysocline. In parts of the southeast Atlantic, the lysocline rose by 2nbsp&km in just a few thousand years.|$|R

Bottom time used for {{decompression}} planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases.

30|$|We assumed D 90 as the {{representative}} depth of BDT for simplicity. It should be noted, however, that more {{recent studies have}} suggested that the zone over which earthquakes may nucleate is actually a subset of the range over which brittle deformation occurs, with the seismogenic zone having a velocity-weakening frictional property (e.g., Scholz, 1998). Therefore, D 90 possibly represents the <b>depth</b> <b>at</b> which velocity-strengthening <b>starts</b> to dominate, and the BDT lies in the deeper regions. In that case, our assumption that D 90 coincides with the BDT may underestimate the depth of the BDT. But, on the other hand, it is speculated that the frictional-stability transition and the BDT are closely related to each other (e.g., Scholz, 2002), and, in fact, there is an observation that co-seismic frictional slip and aseismic plastic flaw coexist {{at the bottom of the}} seismogenic zone (e.g., Takagi et al., 2000). To further complicate matters, the BDT may not represent a sharp transition from brittle to ductile behavior, but rather a more gradual zone of semi-brittle-behavior (e.g., Kohlstedt et al., 1995). Given the lack of constraints on the frictional-stability and BDT, we retain the simplest assumption that D 90 represents the BDT depth. Further refinement of this model may be possible with better information about the transitional properties at the bottom of the seismogenic zone in the future.|$|R

40|$|Water {{repellency}} is a soil property which temporally {{changes in}} severity and is most pronounced when soils are dry. In the past, numerous researchers air- or oven-dried soil samples {{in the laboratory}} to determine the potential water repellency. However, measurement on air- and oven-dried samples can overestimate as well as underestimate the conditions occurring in the field under prolonged drought conditions. To reveal and determine realistic and potentially the highest persistence, we studied the influence of dehydration upon repellency in a dune sand grassland between 11 April and 5 September 2002, by artificially sheltering the soil. The shelter was built to protect the soil from getting wetted by precipitation during this period. The soil was sampled eight times in vertical transects over a distance of 75 cm {{to a depth of}} 33 cm during the dehydration period. On each sampling date soil water contents were measured and the persistence or stability of actual water repellency was determined in 120 field-moist samples collected <b>at</b> 8 <b>depths.</b> <b>At</b> the <b>start</b> of the dehydration experiment the mean volumetric soil water contents in the transect varied between 5 and 10. 5 %. At the end of the dehydration process the grass cover was wilted and yellow-brown and the soil profile dried-up to volumetric water contents between 1 and 2. 5 %. During the dehydration period, the average water storage in the upper 33 cm of the soil (total of 8 layers) decreased from 22 mm to less than 5 mm. Slightly water repellent and wettable dune sand layers <b>at</b> <b>depths</b> of 7 to 19 cm on 11 April were found to be altered into extremely water repellent soil within eight days of dehydration. The most extreme soil water repellency, with water drop penetration times of more than 6 h, was detected in large parts of the five soil layers sampled between depths from 9. 5 to 33 cm on 4 June, 11 July and 5 September, 2002. The maximal water repellency was found to be evidently less in the organic rich surface layer in comparison with the organic poor deeper layers. For each soil layer the relation between soil water content and actual water repellency was determined. This resulted into three distinguished zones: a) a water repellent zone; b) a transition zone and c) a wettable zone. The threshold values of the volumetric water content that describe the transition zone varied per depth...|$|R
