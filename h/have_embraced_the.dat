5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E

25|$|Traditionalist conservatism, {{also known}} as {{traditional}} conservatism, classical conservatism, traditionalism and Toryism (in the United Kingdom and Canada), is a political philosophy emphasizing {{the need for the}} principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, tradition, hierarchy, organic unity, classicism, high culture and the intersecting spheres of loyalty.

25|$|The dispute {{has led to}} much acrimony, and {{sometimes}} even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical intercommunion with those synods which <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on Mount Athos have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to modernism in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.|$|E

25|$|The SD70M-2 {{was not a}} big seller, as {{most major}} {{carriers}} were purchasing AC traction locomotives exclusively {{by the time of}} its introduction. Only 331 SD70M-2's were built.

25|$|Many {{leadership}} {{roles in the}} organized church have been restricted to males. In the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Most mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups, most notably the Southern Baptist Convention, are tightening their constraints in reaction. Most all Charismatic and Pentecostal churches were pioneers in this matter and <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> ordination of women since their founding.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of mobile}} phones {{by people who}} are driving has become {{increasingly}} common, for example as part of their job, {{as in the case of}} delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.|$|E
25|$|Although {{details are}} unclear, there is {{evidence}} that in 1577 De Vere attempted to leave England to see service in the French Wars of Religion on the side of King Henry III. Like many members of older established aristocratic families in England, De Vere inclined to Catholicism; after his return from Italy he was reported to <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> religion, perhaps after being introduced to a seminary priest, Richard Stephens, by a distant kinsman, Charles Arundell. But just as quickly, late in 1580 he denounced a group of Catholics, among them Arundell, Francis Southwell and Henry Howard, for treasonous activities and asking the Queen's mercy for his own, now repudiated, Catholicism. Elizabeth characteristically delayed in acting on the matter and he was detained under house arrest for a short time.|$|E

25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E

500|$|The {{appreciation}} of the show by an older audience {{came as a surprise}} to Hasbro, Faust, and others involved with its development, but they <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> older fans while staying focused on the show's intended audience. Such reciprocity has included participation in fan conventions by the show's voice actors and producers, recognition of the brony fandom in official promotional material, and incorporating background characters popularized by the fans (such as the fandom-named [...] "Derpy Hooves") into in-jokes within the show. As a result of these efforts in part, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has become a major commercial success with the series becoming the highest rated original production in Hub Network's broadcast history.|$|E

By early 2014, Doge's popularity was sustained by internet communities on social media, accompanied by the rapid growth and acceptance of Dogecoin.
