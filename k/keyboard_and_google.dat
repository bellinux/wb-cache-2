40|$|There are {{at least}} three ways to {{determine}} the position or the coordinates of a spot on the Earth's surface. They are: istiwa' sticks, Global Positioning System (GPS), <b>and</b> <b>Google</b> Earth.

Until now, the use of GPS <b>and</b> <b>Google</b> Earth is still a passively consumptive, without their critical analytical effort. This qualitative research using descriptive analytic mathematical methods. The objective of this study is the to know the theory, applications, and accuracy of the istiwa' stick, GPS, <b>and</b> <b>Google</b> Earth comparatively. The study found that the istiwa' stick is one of the alternatives way to determine the coordinates of the Earth which uses the theory of spherical trigonometry calculations simply without assistance. Whereas GPS <b>and</b> <b>Google</b> Earth use principles of geodetic scientifically. In terms of applications, the most practical and accurate is GPS, and then followed by <b>Google</b> Earth, <b>and</b> the last is istiwa' stick...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} plays a {{very important}} role in society. People with disabilities are often limited by slow text input speed despite the use of assistive devices. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a dynamic on-screen keyboard (Custom Virtual <b>Keyboard)</b> <b>and</b> a word-prediction system (Sibylle) on text input speed in participants with functional tetraplegia. Ten participants tested four modes at home (static on-screen <b>keyboard</b> with <b>and</b> without word prediction <b>and</b> dynamic on-screen <b>keyboard</b> with <b>and</b> without word prediction) for 1 mo before choosing one mode and then using it for another month. Initial mean text input speed was around 23 characters per minute with the static <b>keyboard</b> <b>and</b> 12 characters per minute with the dynamic keyboard. The results showed that the dynamic keyboard reduced text input speed by 37 % compared with the standard <b>keyboard</b> <b>and</b> that the addition of word prediction had no effect on text input speed. We suggest that current forms of dynamic <b>keyboards</b> <b>and</b> word prediction may not be suitable for increasing text input speed, particularly for subjects who use pointing devices. Future studies should evaluate the optimal ergonomic design of dynamic <b>keyboards</b> <b>and</b> the number and position of words that should be predicted...|$|R
