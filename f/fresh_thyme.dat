60|$|The Drummond following, with <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> sprays, {{beginning}} to turn brown, were drawn up in the outer court, all with black scarves across the breast--George Douglas among them, of course--and they presently united with the long train of clerks who belonged to the household of the Cardinal of Winchester. Jean managed her veil so as to get more than one peep at the throng in the streets through which they passed, so as to see and to be seen; and she was disappointed that no acclamations greeted the fair face thus displayed by fits. She did not understand English politics {{enough to know that}} a Beaufort face and Beaufort train were the last things the London crowd was likely to applaud. They had not forgotten the penance of the popular Duke Humfrey's wife, which, justly or unjustly, was imputed to the Cardinal and his nephews of Somerset.|$|E

50|$|Turkish cacık {{is made of}} yoghurt, salt, olive oil, crushed garlic, chopped cucumber, mint. Among these ingredients, vinegar (mostly white grape or apple), lemon juice, and sumac are optional. Dill and <b>thyme</b> (<b>fresh</b> or dried) and sumac and paprika may be used alternately.Mostly, cacik {{is served}} to {{accompany}} main dishes. As a side dish, it is diluted with water, which results in a soup-like consistency. If consumed as a meze, it is prepared undiluted but follows the same recipe. Often, dill and thyme are added as well. Ground paprika may also be added if it is prepared as a meze and to be served with some grilled meat, other mezes or rakı (a Turkish spirit similar to Greek ouzo). More rarely, it is prepared with lettuce or carrots instead of cucumber {{under the name of}} kış cacığı (winter cacık) or havuç tarator.|$|R
50|$|The best-known {{spices and}} herbs include pepper, parsley, arugula, celery, <b>fresh</b> {{coriander}} (cilantro), <b>thyme,</b> and oregano. Traditionally, cumin and coriander seeds {{make up the}} main cooking aromas of the island. Mint {{is a very important}} herb in Cyprus. It grows abundantly, and locals use it for everything, particularly in dishes containing ground meat. For example, the Cypriot version of pastitsio (locally known as macaronia tou fournou) contains very little tomato and generous amounts of mint. The same is true of keftedes (meat balls, which are sometimes laced with mint to provide a contrast with the meat. Fresh coriander or cilantro (commonly known as kolyandro or kolliandros on the island) is another commonly used herb. It is often used in salads, olive breads, spinach pies (spanakopita) and other pastries. In some regions of the island it is also used to flavour hot dishes, particularly tomato-based ones, such as yiachnista.|$|R

Pass on to the poem on the man who tortures himself, let its subtle music steal into your brain and colour your thoughts, {{and you will}} become for a moment what he was who wrote it; nay, not for a moment only, but for many barren moonlit nights and sunless sterile days will a despair that is not your own make its dwelling within you, and the misery of another gnaw your heart away. Read the whole book, suffer it to tell even one of its secrets to your soul, and your soul will grow eager to know more, and will feed upon poisonous honey, and seek to repent of strange crimes of which it is guiltless, and to make atonement for terrible pleasures that it has never known. And then, when you are tired of these flowers of evil, turn to the flowers that grow in the garden of Perdita, and in their dew-drenched chalices cool your fevered brow, and let their loveliness heal and restore your soul; or wake from his forgotten tomb the sweet Syrian, Meleager, and bid the lover of Heliodore make you music, for he too has flowers in his song, red pomegranate blossoms, and irises that smell of myrrh, ringed daffodils and dark blue hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkled ox-eyes. Dear to him was the perfume of the bean-field at evening, and dear to him the odorous eared-spikenard that grew on the Syrian hills, and the <b>fresh</b> green <b>thyme,</b> the wine-cup's charm. The feet of his love as she walked in the garden were like lilies set upon lilies. Softer than sleep-laden poppy petals were her lips, softer than violets and as scented. The flame-like crocus sprang from the grass to look at her. For her the slim narcissus stored the cool rain; and for her the anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that wooed them. And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor narcissus was as fair as she was.|$|R

50|$|Along {{the border}} with Northbrook, Deerbrook Mall opened in 1971. It {{includes}} both an indoor and outdoor shopping area- the last store located inside the mall was TJ Maxx which moved to Northbrook in 2014, finally allowing {{the interior of the}} mall to close. Near Deerbrook Mall is Cadwell's Corners, a small outdoor mall that carries the village's original name. Cadwell's Corners was mostly empty of stores by 2011, and the Deerfield Public Library selected the location for a temporary library during renovation of their original building. Since <b>Fresh</b> <b>Thyme</b> moved in in June 2014, Cadwell's Corners has filled in.|$|E

Although the menus change daily, highlighting the best seasonal products available, several signature items remain: the Hot and Hot Shrimp and Grits made with Country Ham, <b>Fresh</b> <b>Thyme,</b> Tomatoes and Ver Jus is always a favorite among the locals and Elton’s Chocolate Soufflé with Fresh Cream {{continues to be a}} favorite ending to many meals at the restaurant.|$|E
50|$|Downers Grove's retail {{economy is}} largely {{supported}} by the local section of Ogden Avenue. Formerly part of U.S. Route 66, the stretch of Ogden Avenue that weaves through Chicago's western suburbs is particularly known for its extensive range of automobile dealerships, classic car dealerships, and service centers. Brands represented by Downers Grove auto groups include Aston Martin, Bentley, Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram, Ford, Lamborghini, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Volkswagen. Ogden—a colloquial shortening of the road's name—is also framed {{by a variety of}} grocery and convenience stores such as CVS, <b>Fresh</b> <b>Thyme</b> Farmers Market, Jewel, Trader Joe's, and Walgreens. While the road serves primarily as a route to destinations, industrial and corporate parks that host the aforementioned headquarters can be found on Ogden's tributaries adjacent to major tollways such as I-355 or I-88.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{the main}} dish is the butter sauce. The Paris {{newspaper}} Le Monde reports that it is made from chicken livers, <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> and thyme flowers, full cream, white Dijon mustard, butter, and water, plus salt and pepper. According to Le Monde, the chicken livers are blanched in one pan with the thyme until they start to turn colour. In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. The chicken livers are then finely minced and pressed through a strainer into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into {{it with a little}} water, it is beaten smooth, and fresh-ground salt and pepper are added. The London newspaper The Independent, however, reports that Hélène Godillot has dismissed the Le Monde report as inaccurate.|$|E

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} various plant extracts on Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from spoiled chilled tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated in this study. In {{the first stage}} of this study, red tilapia was subjected to chilled storage (4 °C) for 3 weeks, and spoilage bacteria were isolated and identified from the spoiled fish. Pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria isolated from the spoiled fish and further identification revealed that P. putida, P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas spp. were the main species of this group. In the second stage, methanolic extracts of 15 selected plant species were screened for their antimicrobial activity, by agar disc diffusion method, against the Pseudomonas isolates. Results indicated that most of the extracts had different degrees of activity against the bacterial isolates. The strongest activity was exhibited by bottlebrush flower (Callistemon viminalis) extract. This was followed by extracts from guava bark (Psidium guajava) and henna leaf (Lawsonia inermis). Moderate antimicrobial activities were observed in extracts of clove (Syzygium aromaticum), leaf and peel of tamarind (Tamarindus indica), cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), wild betel leaf (Piper sarmentosum) and <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> (Thymus spp.). Weak or no antimicrobial activity was observed from the remaining extracts. The potential antimicrobial activity shown by some plant extracts in this study could significantly contribute to the fish preservation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{specificity}} of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair as marker of alcohol consumption exceeds by far those of fatty acid ethyl esters. False positive cases are therefore very rare but not excluded as recent publications have shown. Especially, {{the use of}} plant extracts containing high percentages of ethanol can lead to EtG hair concentrations typically found in cases of chronic alcohol consumption. As proposed by Baumgartner et al., a nucleohilic substitution could most likely explain this phenomenon. Fresh and dried plants as well as commercial hair lotions based on plants extracts have been analysed for EtG presence or EtG formation. Methods: Urtica dioica, Plantago lanceolata, Cortex Quercus, Sempervivum, Armoracia rusticana, Juniperus communis, Brassica alba, Thymian vulgaris, Salvia officinalis, Majorana hortensis, Aloe vera, birch gingko and green tea leafs, ginger, lemon grass were extracted in water, water/ethanol (50 / 50) and ethanol (100 %). The extracts as well as diluted hair lotions were measured by immunological test (Microgenics DRI® EtG assay) and by LC-MS/MS on Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC coupled with an AB Sciex 4500 QTrap. Results: EtG could not be detected in water extracts of all tested plants. However, DRI® EtG assay indicated the presence of EtG in 66 % of the tested ethanolic plant extracts. That could only be confirmed by mass spectrometry {{in the cases of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> as well as in dried birch, oak and plantain extracts where EtG concentrations between of 0. 25 and 2, 09 mg/l were measured. In one hair lotion, the EtG concentration was 0, 76 mg/l. Conclusion: Ethanolic plant extracts represents a non-negligible risk for false positive EtG hair tests, especially when applied as lotion without following washing out. The use of hair care products must therefore be evaluated at every hair sampling. In case of doubt, the product should be analysed by mass spectrometric methods since the presence of EtG can't be proven by use of the DRI® EtG assay, only. Our results support Baumgartner's assumption of a nucleophilic substitution in presence of ethanol because EtG was only measured in the ethanolic extracts...|$|E
40|$|I love food. I love cooking, baking, testing, and eating. I {{read about}} food preparation, food facts, and food service. Over the years I’ve {{developed}} my {{fair share of}} knowledge about cooking and I’m a decent cook, but I’m no chef. I guess I’m what you’d call a “foodie”. However, I have {{the good fortune to}} have a friend who is a chef and owns one of the best, and certainly the most innovative, restaurants in town. During this summer I hosted a cooking class in my home for my family with my chef friend as instructor. The Tex-Mex barbecue theme was a big hit (you can contact me for recipes, if you like), but much more fascinating was the explanation of the science behind the cooking. It turns out that there is a term for this: molecular gastronomy. Another term, and hence the genesis of my “Eureka!” moment of the summer, is evidence based cooking. Good cooking is not just following a recipe (not all of which are evidence based) but at its best is the culmination of heaps of tested information regarding why and how chemical and environmental factors work together to result in a gastronomical delight. For example, will brining or marinating a pork chop make it moister? And, if brining, what temperature should the water be, how long should it soak, and how much salt is needed? Why does pounding meat increase its tenderness? What will keep guacamole from browning better – the pit or lime juice? What does baking soda do in a chocolate cake? Eggs or no eggs in fresh pasta? Like most librarians, I tend not to take information at face value. I want to know where information comes from and {{whether or not it is}} valid, based on specific factors. I’ve come to notice that evidence based, or evidence informed, practice is everywhere and has a tremendous impact on our lives. Why do you rotate the tires on your car? Evidence shows that the front tires wear more quickly (think about all those 3 -pointturns, the braking, etc) and therefore, switching the front tires with the back tires will increase the life span of the tires. Ergonomics is based heavily on human factors research and usability testing; theme park design is largely affected by studies onthe psychology of waiting; the study of local weather patterns and temperatures directly affects landscape architecture; advertising is strategically designed and presented based upon sociological studies such as demographics and viewing/reading behaviour. Could one argue that natural evolution is a result of nature’s long-term evidence-based practice? I know that I’m not alone in finding this fascinating, especially since the basis of these studies is information. While my own work may focus more on medical and health information, I feel that as an information specialist I can take pride in the fact that the soul of my field, information, is essential to the world around me. Think about this when you feel yourself getting cynical about research and the validity of your profession (don’t tell me you’ve never been there). I will be the first to admit that evidence is not always the be-all and end-all. There is a lot to be said for spontaneity (i. e. Hmmmm… I wonder if a sprig of <b>fresh</b> <b>thyme</b> would taste good in the mushroom sauce?”) and happenstance (i. e. “Well, whaddaya know [...] . penicillin!”). I certainly don’t think that every decision needs to be researched. But thank goodness for many research based decisions, without which the world would be a very different place and, heaven forbid, the perfect crème brulée may not exist...|$|E
