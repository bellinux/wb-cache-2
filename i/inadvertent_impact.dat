I implement an experiment among migrants in Washington, DC, and their families in El Salvador that examines how information asymmetries can have strategic and <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impacts</b> on remittance decisions. Migrants make an incentivized decision over how much of a cash windfall to remit, and recipients decide how they will spend a remittance.

Disruption of normal host–parasite relationships is inevitable during translocation, and targeted anti-parasitic drug treatment may exacerbate this phenomenon with <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impacts</b> on both target and non-target parasite species. Here, we investigate the effects of ivermectin treatment on communities of gastrointestinal parasites in translocated woylies (Bettongia penicillata). Faecal samples were collected at three time points (at the time of translocation, and 1 and 3 months post-translocation) and examined for nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts. Parasite prevalence and (for nematodes) abundance were estimated in both treated and untreated hosts. In our study, a single subcutaneous injection of ivermectin significantly reduced Strongyloides-like egg counts 1 month post-translocation. Strongyle egg counts and coccidia prevalence were not reduced by ivermectin treatment, but were strongly influenced by site. Likewise, month of sampling rather than ivermectin treatment positively influenced body condition in woylies post-translocation. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of ivermectin in temporarily reducing Strongyloides-like nematode abundance in woylies. We also highlight the possibility that translocation-induced changes to host density may influence coinfecting parasite abundance and host body condition post-translocation...|$|R

40|$|Modification {{of cloud}} albedo by {{controlled}} emission of sea spray particles {{into the atmosphere}} has been suggested as a possible geoengineering option to slow global warming. Previous global studies have imposed changes in cloud drop concentration in low level clouds to explore the radiative and climatic effects. Here, we use a global aerosol transport model to quantify how an imposed flux of sea spray particles affects the natural aerosol processes, the particle size distribution, and concentrations of cloud drops. We assume that the proposed fleet of vessels emits sea spray particles with a wind speed-dependent flux into four regions of persistent stratocumulus cloud off the western coasts of continents. The model results show that fractional changes in cloud drop number concentration (CDNC) vary substantially between the four regions because of differences in wind speed (which affects the spray efficiency of the vessels), transport and particle deposition rates, and because of variations in aerosols from natural and anthropogenic sources. Using spray emission rates comparable to those implied by previous studies {{we find that the}} predicted CDNC changes are very small (maximum 20 %) and in one of the four regions even negative. The weak or negative effect is because the added particles suppress the in-cloud supersaturation and prevent existing aerosol particles from forming cloud drops. A scenario with five times higher emissions (considerably higher than previously assumed) increases CDNC on average by 45 – 163 %, but median concentrations are still below the 375 cm − 3 assumed in previous studies. An inadvertent effect of the spray emissions is that sulphur dioxide concentrations are suppressed by 1 – 2 % in the seeded regions and sulphuric acid vapour by 64 – 68 % due to chemical reactions on the additional salt particles. The impact of this suppression on existing aerosol is negligible in the model, but should be investigated further in the real environment so that <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impacts</b> can be excluded...|$|R

We analysed the association and ranging patterns of 242 individually identified bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in eastern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, and distinguished two separate communities of dolphins. Unlike bottlenose dolphins elsewhere, the communities' core areas overlapped substantially. There was a correlation between the dolphins' responses to fishing activities and community membership-members of one community feed in association with trawlers {{and members of the}} other do not. Apart from feeding mode, the communities differed in habitat preference and group sizes. <b>Inadvertent</b> anthropogenic <b>impacts</b> on animals' societies are likely to be far more widespread than just this study and can increase conservation challenges.

40|$|This is {{the nearly}} {{final version of}} an article {{presented}} at HCI 2012 People and Computers XXVI, an {{annual conference of the}} British Computer Society held on September 12 - 14, 2012 in Birmingham (UK).

Replicating a recent study by MacKenzie and Isokoski (2008), we tested the throughput invariance hypothesis with some fresh data and found the TP to be systematically affected by the strategy. This result, we suggest, pleads against the currently popular definition of the TP inherited from Fitts (1954), namely TP = ID/MT, which we recall is incompatible with the Shannon equation. We also show that the statistical elaboration of the TP suffers from a problematic amount of uncontrolled variability due to the multiple <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impact</b> of Jensen's inequality...|$|E
40|$|Immunologists {{have relied}} heavily on {{oil-based}} adjuvants to generate antibodies or induce auto-allergic responses in experimental animals. These are rarely used today for human vaccination because of their persistent irritancies and propensity to cause ulcers at sites of injection. However oily materials with adjuvant properties abound in our modern environment, both personal and extraneous. Their <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impact</b> as cryptotoxins {{may contribute to the}} rising incidence of auto-allergic diseases in recent times. Experimentally, the potential adjuvanticity of various oils, fats and other lipids can be evaluated by their ability (or otherwise) to induce auto-allergic disease(s) in rats and mice with, or even without, the addition of a mycobacterial immunostimulant. Genetic factors have been recognized that determine an animal's susceptibility or resistance to these oil-induced immunopathies. So it may be profitable to further characterize these factors, first in animals and then perhaps in human populations, to help find ways to enhance natural resistance to those adjuvant-active oils that may be widely distributed in the personal environment, notably mineral oil(s). (The six tables in this article summarize some relevant facts and a few conjectures.) A caveat: This review is restricted to the adjuvant properties of some oils in the personal environment.

40|$|There is {{a rather}} {{remarkable}} and surprisingly uncontroversial result in economic theory known as the Second Welfare Theorem: under certain idealized conditions, a competi-tive free-market economy will achieve Pareto optimality. Pareto optimality is a widely-accepted, weak condition for a well-functioning economy: there are no changes that can improve one person’s welfare without harming {{at least one other}} person. All undisputable welfare improvements have been made. However, the conditions required for competitive markets to have this property are far from the conditions of real economies. The cen-tral tasks of environmental economics are to identify market failures that prevent Pareto optimality, and to design remedies for these failures. Externalities are the most pervasive type of market failure. An externality is present when the activity of one person has an <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impact</b> on the well-being of another person. Environmental externalities are common because the use of many resources im-poses costs on society, but the user of the resource is not charged a price equal to the cost imposed. For example, the smoke emitted by a factory unintentionally worsens air quality for nearby residents. The factory owner pays for the steel and oil used in production, but not for the use of clean air. 1 Externalities prevent the achievement of Pareto optimality because the polluter does not equate his or her incremental benefit of generating a bit more pollution to the incre-mental social cost of that pollution. To see this, suppose a factory can lower its production cost by buying much dirtier but slightly cheaper coal. The benefit to the factory is a small cost savings. The cost to society is the greater air pollution. If the factory owner keeps the cost savings and doesn’t bear the cost of dirty air, even the smallest cost savings will be pursued, no matter how dirty the coal. Suppose the cost savings is $ 1, but the social cost o...|$|E

40|$|Coral reefs in Broward County are {{increasingly}} threatened by coastal and marine construction activities. Infrastructure installation (cables, pipelines, and sewer outfalls), beach renourishment, and dredge and fill operations have both anticipated and <b>inadvertent</b> <b>impacts</b> which {{may result in}} reef damage. Mitigation practices consisting of impact avoidance and minimization are necessary to prevent and offset reef damage. Coral transplantation is a commonly utilized impact minimization tool which aims to protect corals threatened by impending construction projects. Coral colonies are removed from their natural habitats and relocated to analogous unthreatened sites prior to construction. This study focuses on coral transplantation that occurred as impact minimization for two recently completed coastal and marine construction projects in Broward County. The first project involved relocation of colonies to natural reef away from potential damage by a natural gas pipeline geotechnical survey. The second project involved relocation of colonies to an artificial reef {{in relation to a}} beach renourishment project. Colonies from both projects were monitored and analyzed in regards to survival and growth to determine transplantation success. A combined 1100 colonies were transplanted for these projects, with approximately 25 % of these chosen for 18 - 24 months of monitoring. The projects had high attachment rates between 92 - 100 % and survival rates between 87 - 99 %. A majority of colonies exhibited positive growth at an average rate of 0. 03 %- 0. 04 % of initial tissue area per day. There were no apparent detrimental effects of transplantation such as reduced initial growth rates, disease, bleaching, or increased partial mortality. These results indicate that coral transplantation was highly successful from a biological standpoint. This study also demonstrates that coral transplantation is a valid and effective component of impact minimization whereby colonies that may otherwise be destroyed, can be successfully preserved. For this study, coral transplantation proved to be an economically worthwhile method of conserving an ecologically and economically valuable reef resource. However, coral transplantation is only one facet of impact minimization and mitigation. Ideally, future mitigation projects should also aim to reduce habitat loss and preserve biota in addition to stony corals...|$|R

Diffuse objectives, technical innovations, eternal optimism, and—above all—no quantification impede the exact evaluation of historical reports. After 1950, when quantification improved, a slow but consistent decline was observed, but it is only two decades after the crash in glass eel recruitment (in 1980), that protection plans addressed the bad status of the stock.

40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{sounding}} of Ulrich Beck's and Edgar Grande's conceptual {{map of the}} varieties of second modernity - Western and Non-Western, European and beyond - that makes up today's world. Their mapping is examined {{in the light of}} two, striking analytical perspectives associated with Ulrich Beck: everyday 'cosmopolitization' and his call for a methodological cosmopolitanism. A line of inquiry explores whether contemporary modernities are essentially expressions of a single, underlying modernization drive or whether they are utterly disparate entities. The implications of treating them as 'variants and variations' are unpacked with reference to musical models and how they generate difference. The probe into methodological cosmopolitanism touches on 'de-provincialization' that is somewhat at odds with the postcolonial project of 'provincializing' Europe. It looks at the attempt to go beyond 'nation-bound' sociological dualisms in determining the appropriate 'unit of analysis' for our ever-morphing current reality. Does this imply engaging with 'singularity'- with a mode of conceptualization that sidesteps the universal/particular couple and related either/or thinking? References to the making of the 'first modernity' under unequal centre/periphery relations of colonial power are aired for possible lessons in mappings of the second. Ulrich Beck's 'impure, really-existing cosmopolitanism'- in contrast to its speculative counterpart derived from the realm of pure ideas - springs from humdrum global economic and political links and institutions that span out across, above and beyond the 'container of the national space'. With the <b>inadvertent</b> cosmopolitical <b>impact</b> of the migrations it amounts in practice to a functioning 'cosmopolitan realpolitik'. Is there room for it to develop or will it stall as a mere front for national, tribal-territorial interests - going the way of 'multiculturalism and diversity' that seem increasingly to serve as governmental ideologies for managing global difference? Whether each of the varieties of second modernity throws up a 'cosmopolitan vision' of its own remains to be determined more fully. It seems possible that friction between the modernities might fetch up on a higher plane as clashing cosmopolitanisms. Historical precedents give scant comfort {{if we look at the}} fate of the ecumenic empires of the ancient world of the 'first cosmopolitan age' or at landmark cosmopolitan endeavours such as Aby Warburg's and WEB Du Bois' on the eve of counter-cosmopolitan currents of the 1930 s. An abiding scepticism prevails about the capacity of 'impure cosmopolitanism' to bootstrap and elaborate itself from an involuntary, reflex condition into a self-reflexive, critical dispensation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a policy framework for improving outcomes for remote Indigenous land tenure and housing policy in Australia. The framework is developed from {{an analysis of}} related policies and programs in several pioneer settler societies with similar historical characteristics to Australia. The number of pioneer settler societies {{in the world is}} small. Originating in the 16 th through 18 th centuries, these societies grew out of European colonization practices that displaced indigenous societies, and made indigenous people a minority in their own land. The four societies examined in this thesis are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and The United States of America. This thesis is presented in three parts. Part 1 (Chapters 1 - 3) scopes the problem being addressed in this thesis: the gap(s) in well being between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people as measured by indicators of wellbeing such as housing, health, education, and employment. These quality of life gaps {{can be seen as the}} result of two <b>inadvertent</b> and compounding <b>impacts</b> on indigenous people from colonial dispossession: 1) removal of livelihoods through a lack of access to land-based resources, and 2) loss of cultural identity I caused by being separated from the land Elements of successes in different pioneer settler societies are later used to formulate a framework for improved land tenure and housing policy outcomes for remote Indigenous Australia. Part 1 also {{presents a}}n overview of the research design used in the case studies of ! the four pioneer settler societies. Part 2 (Chapters 4 - 7) presents the case studies of indigenous housing and land tenure in the four pioneer settler societies. The policy factors that are analyzed illustrate the various methods used by governments in an attempt improve Indigenous quality of life. Part 3 (Chapters 8 - 10) draws upon the data in the four case studies to develop a policy framework for use in Australia. Chapter 8 presents a meta-analysis of the four case studies, which identifies a wide range of lessons potentially relevant to Australian context from the other three nations. Similarities and differences in policy approaches and outcomes for pioneer settler societies are identified, compared, and contrasted. A synthesis of the lessons from the meta-analysis is used to identify two themes and eight &# 039;building blocks&# 039; to frame policymaking. These themes are: &# 039;Experiencing the Land and People&# 039;, and The Policy Process These &# 039;building blocks&# 039; and principles can make sure that the actors, activities and practices used in the policymaking process facilitate the exchange of relevant information, redress potential conflict and maximize opportunities for collaboration among stakeholders in policymaking. The framework for policymaking is an insightful tool for making sense of the complexities associated with particular policy decisions, thus expediting improved policy outcomes on land tenure and housing issues. As such, the policy &# 039;building blocks&# 039; and supporting principles provide a road map for developing a policy framework that can bridge &# 039;the gap&# 039; in well being between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people...|$|R
