50|$|Pairs of sensor {{elements}} may be wired as opposite inputs to a differential amplifier. In such a configuration, the PIR measurements {{cancel each other}} so that the average temperature {{of the field of}} view is removed from the electrical signal; an increase of IR energy across the entire sensor is self-cancelling and will not trigger the device. This allows the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> false indications of change in the event of being exposed to brief flashes of light or field-wide illumination. (Continuous high energy exposure may still be able to saturate the sensor materials and render the sensor unable to register further information.) At the same time, this differential arrangement minimizes common-mode interference, allowing the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> triggering due <b>to</b> nearby electric fields. However, a differential pair of sensors cannot measure temperature in this configuration, and therefore is only useful for motion detection.|$|R

This paper proposes a new technique for structural control of RC buildings with soft story by using HPFRCC devices, which are placed beside the existing columns in the ground story. The advantage of the HPFRCC devices is selective structural performance by varying the configuration, bar arrangements and type of materials used. Also, since the HPFRCC <b>devices</b> can <b>resist</b> <b>to</b> the axial force, axial force acting in the existing columns due to overturning moment can be reduced. As the result of dynamic analysis, the response drift of the buildings was successfully controlled to meet high level of structural performance requirements by using HPFRCC devices. ...|$|R
30|$|Tamper {{resistance}} {{measures the}} difficulty level of finding another pixel for a pixel {{within the same}} block, another homogeneous region for a homogeneous region in the same image, or another block for a block in the same image (or a different image) for replacement (tampering) by the attacker without altering the watermark while maintaining {{the quality of the}} image. Hence we quantify the tamper resistance as the probability (let us denote it by TRP in this paper) of failure of finding replacement pixels or blocks by random guess or systematic approach by an attacker. Thus, Step 1 is carried out <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>tampering</b> in homogeneous regions; Step 2 is carried out to make the 3 [*]LSB-bit watermark dependent on the 5 MSB-bits and fragile; Step 3 is carried out to make the fragile watermarks independent of each other; Steps 4 and 5 are to eliminate the statistical property of the image present in the watermark; Step 6 is carried out <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>tampering</b> in any part of the image. It means that the statistical properties, such as the frequency count of similar blocks or regions and local variance and mean of a block or an image region should not be noticeable in the watermark, because it will help the attacker to guess the pixel, image block, or image region for tampering.|$|R

30|$|An {{efficient}} fragile image watermarking {{technique for}} pixel level tamper detection and resistance is proposed. It uses five most significant {{bits of the}} pixels to generate watermark bits and embeds them in the three least significant bits. The proposed technique uses a logistic map and takes advantage of its sensitivity property to a small change in the initial condition. At the same time, it incorporates the confusion/diffusion and hashing techniques used in many cryptographic systems <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>tampering</b> at pixel level {{as well as at}} block level. This paper also presents two new approaches called nonaggressive and aggressive tamper detection algorithms. Simulations show that the proposed technique can provide more than 99.39 % tamper detection capability with less than 2.31 % false-positive detection and less than 0.61 % false-negative detection responses.|$|R

The 3 TCACs will <b>resist</b> <b>to</b> the DoS because they are configured to not process more than n[*]signalling messages overall. Besides, each signalling message encompasses a timestamp value added by the issuing 3 TCAC and marking the instant of its generation. As all the 3 TCACs are synchronized, replayed messages are easily detected by the receiving 3 TCAC which has to verify its current timestamp value in order to decide whether the message is replayed. All replayed messages will be simply ignored. Malicious RSs may also try to usurp the identity of other RSs or modify the integrity of the signalling message in order <b>to</b> <b>tamper</b> with the results of QoS estimation. This attack is detected since all signalling messages are created by the 3 TCACs which also sign them. Note that the 3 TCACs store the public keys of their subordinates and their superordinate in order to verify the signatures of the exchanged messages.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT RELIABILITY AND EFFECT OF PARTIALLY RESTRAINED WOOD SHEAR WALLS by JOHN J. GRUBER MARCH 2012 Advisor:	Dr. Gongkang Fu Major:		Civil Engineering Degree:	Doctor or Philosophy The {{prescriptive}} {{design of}} the most widely used residential building code in the United States, the IRC, allows the use of partially restrained wood shear walls <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> wind and seismic loads. Wind load is the most common controlling lateral design load for these structures. In contrast, the complimenting building code, the IBC, requires either a restraining dead load or a mechanical hold down <b>device</b> <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> overturning. <b>To</b> prescribe a safe structure, {{it is important to know}} the effect of partial restraint on the overturning resistance of wood shear walls constructed in accordance with the IRC and equally important whether the partially restrained wood shear walls provide the same level of reliability as fully restrained wood shear walls for wind load. This is the focus of this research. Twenty five Monotonic tests were conducted of 42 ̆ 7 x 82 ̆ 7 wood shear walls with five varying restraining methods (wall types). There were five sets of five wall types. One of the sets had only an anchor bolt, three sets had different dead loads with one anchor bolt, and one set had a mechanical hold down. The results of the test program were used to determine the partial restraint effect, create a nonlinear finite element model, and to determine the statistical data required to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the wall behavior. The Monte Carlo simulation result was used to calibrate a nonlinear partial restraint factor to a target reliability index of 3. 25. The calibration was performed for both ASD and LRFD load combinations as required by the IBC. The research concludes with a closed-form solution, including the calibrated nonlinear partial restraint factor developed, to determine the unit shear capacity of a partially restrained or fully restrained (with dead load or mechanical hold down) wood shear wall constructed in accordance with the IRC by utilizing the fully restrained nominal unit shear values of AF 2 ̆ 6 PA 2 ̆ 7 s Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} design philosophy, for structures {{equipped with}} control <b>devices,</b> capable <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> an expected earthquake while {{remaining in the}} elastic range, is described. The idea is that {{a portion of the}} earthquake loading is under¬taken by the control system and the remaining by the structure which is designed <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> elastically. The earthquake forces assuming elastic behavior (elastic forces) and elastoplastic behavior (design forces) are first calculated ac¬cording to the codes. The required control forces are calculated as the difference from elastic to design forces. The maximum value of capacity of control devices is then compared to the required control force. If the capacity of the control devices is larger than the required control force then the control devices are accepted and installed in the structure and the structure is designed according to the design forces. If the capacity is smaller than the required control force then a scale factor, α, reducing the elastic forces to new design forces is calculated. The structure is redesigned and devices are installed. The proposed procedure ensures that the structure behaves elastically (without damage) for the expected earthquake at no additional cost, excluding that of buying and installing the control devices...|$|R

40|$|Allowing shear {{walls to}} rock {{is one way}} of {{protecting}} structures from earthquake damage, or at least minimising this damage. Walls allowed to rock must have the ability <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> both overturning moment, and lateral forces. While resistance to overturning is typically provided by self-weight, post-tensioned cables, and/or damping devices acting as hold-downs, a particular challenge is to provide adequate resistance to lateral forces, which will not interfere with, nor disturb the function of the <b>devices</b> chosen <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> overturning. During an earthquake, there will typically be high contact forces between the shear keys and shear walls. Friction induced by these contact forces can add to the moment resistance against overturning – often in an unpredictable way. While supplemental moment resistance could be considered a desirable outcome in the case of non-rocking walls; in the case of rocking walls, their load limiting ability could be compromised. A new shear key concept, that is both simple and economical, is proposed and implemented at the bottom centre of an experimental timber wall that is allowed to rock. Under loading, the shear key performed as intended, providing adequate lateral resistance, {{while at the same time}} allowing the wall to rock in the intended manner...|$|R
