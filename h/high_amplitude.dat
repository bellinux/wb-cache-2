25|$|NREM Stage 3 (N3 – deep sleep, slow-wave sleep – 15–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): Formerly divided into stages 3 and 4, {{this stage is}} called slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. SWS is {{initiated}} in the preoptic area and consists of delta activity, <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> waves at less than 3.5Hz. The sleeper is less responsive to the environment; many environmental stimuli no longer produce any reactions. Slow-wave sleep {{is thought to be}} the most restful form of sleep, the phase which most relieves subjective feelings of sleepiness and restores the body.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{the problem}} of {{definition}} has been addressed by observing overall brain activity {{in the form of}} characteristic EEG patterns. Each stage of sleep and wakefulness has a characteristic pattern of EEG which can be used to identify the stage of sleep. Waking is usually characterized by beta (12–30Hz) and gamma (25–100Hz) depending on whether there was a peaceful or stressful activity. The onset of sleep involves slowing down of this frequency to the drowsiness of alpha (8–12Hz) and finally to theta (4–10Hz) of Stage 1 NREM sleep. This frequency further decreases progressively through the higher stages of NREM and REM sleep. On the other hand, the amplitude of sleep waves is lowest during wakefulness (10–30μV) and shows a progressive increase through the various stages of sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (intermittent clusters of waves at sigma frequency i.e. 12–14Hz) and K complexes (sharp upward deflection followed by slower downward deflection). Stage 3 sleep has more sleep spindles. Stages 3 and 4 have very <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> delta waves (0–4Hz) and are known as slow wave sleep. REM sleep is characterized by low amplitude, mixed frequency waves. A sawtooth wave pattern is often present.|$|E

25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to <b>high</b> <b>amplitude</b> and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{compress}} a chirp pulse of duration T seconds, which sweeps linearly in frequency from F1 Hz to F2 Hz, a device with {{the characteristics of}} a dispersive delay line is required. [...] This provides most delay for the frequency F1, the first to be generated, but with a delay which reduces linearly with frequency, to be T second less at the end frequency F2.

The EEG signature appears almost identical to beta oscillations induced by benzodiazepine drugs that modulate GABAA receptors, suggesting that the signature is driven by overexpression of duplicated GABAA receptor genes GABRA5, GABRB3, and GABRG3 found on 15q11.2-q13.1.
