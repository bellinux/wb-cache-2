5|$|Andayya, {{taking a}} non-conformist path {{that was never}} {{repeated}} in Kannada literature, wrote Madana Vijaya ("Triumph of cupid", 1217–1235) using only pure Kannada words (desya) and naturalised Sanskrit words (tadbhava) and totally avoiding assimilated Sanskrit words (tatsamas). This is seen {{by some as a}} rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed Sanskrit words was possible. The poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the Himalayas. In his anger, Kama (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as Sobagina Suggi ("Harvest of Beauty"), Kavane Gella ("Cupid's Conquest") and Kabbigara-kava ("Poets defender"). Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains and the Veerashaivas, whose popularity was on the rise, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> historians.|$|E
500|$|April 15, 2008, was the 61st {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Over 330 team members wore number 42, {{more than the}} over 240 last year. When the teams took the field, all players, {{managers}} and coaches were wearing number 42, and was repeated at all other 14 ballparks that had scheduled games that day. All players wore number 42 at games including the Washington Nationals' game at the New York Mets, Pittsburgh's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels' game at the Texas Rangers. The Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays also wore number 42, increasing the total to nine teams. [...] "The significance of Jackie Robinson Day <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> anyone", said Bob DuPuy. [...] "As {{more and more people}} realize what April 15 means, not only for baseball, but for our country in general, I think you're going to see the celebration grow annually." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{is known}} only as 'The Proud' but despite this {{formidable}} title, she treats Ipomadon kindly and soon {{falls in love with}} him. Ipomadon, however, displays more interest in hunting deer than in warfare and jousting, a fact that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the other noblemen at her court who begin to make fun of him. She tries to shame him into taking an interest in more manly pursuits, but her rebuke backfires and Ipomadon secretly leaves her court early the next morning with all his baggage. He has been known during his stay simply as the [...] "straunge valete", or the 'strange or unknown young man', and the Proud realises to her horror that she knows nothing about him, neither his name nor where he is from, and so has little hope of ever finding him again.|$|E

The UK continues to be probably Sedaka's most welcoming nation, and has been since first moving his family there (temporarily) four decades ago.

[...] Indeed, it was his work with the musicians who would, in a few years, become the hit-making group 10cc that {{brought him back to}} the U.S. as a major star with No. 1 hits {{and a number of other}} major Top 40 singles. The UK always takes up a major portion of Sedaka's touring year in the 21st century.|$|E
6000|$|Things {{had already}} gone so far, that Townshend brought Chesterfield over from the Hague, last Autumn;--a Baron de Montesquieu, with the ESPRIT DE LOIS in his head, sailed with Lord Chesterfield on that occasion, {{and is now in}} England [...] "for two years;"--but Chesterfield could not be made Secretary; industrious Duke of Newcastle stuck so close by that office, and by the skirts of Walpole.

60|$|For I {{have said}} that these {{hospitals}} witness silently for God and for Christ; and I must believe that that silent witness <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the minds of thousands who enter them. It sinks in,--all the more readily {{because it is not}} thrust upon them,--and softens and breaks up their hearts to receive the precious seed of the word of God. Many a man, too ready from bitter experience to believe that his fellow-men cared not for him, has entered the wards of a hospital to be happily undeceived. He finds that he is cared for; that he is not forgotten either by God or man; that there is a place for him, too, at God's table, in his hour of utmost need; and angels of God, in human form, ready to minister to his necessities; and, softened by that discovery, he has listened humbly, perhaps {{for the first time in}} his life, to the exhortations of a clergyman; and has taken in, in the hour of dependence and weakness, the lessons which he was too proud or too sullen to hear in the day of independence and sturdy health. And so do these hospitals, it seems to me, follow the example and practice of our Lord Himself; who, by ministering to the animal wants and animal sufferings of the people, by showing them that He sympathised with those lower sorrows of which they were most immediately conscious, made them follow Him gladly, and listen to Him with faith, when He proclaimed to them in words of wisdom, that Father in heaven whom He had already proclaimed to them in acts of mercy.|$|E

50|$|DGD {{supports}} persistence as {{a driver}} feature in ways that many languages simply can't.
