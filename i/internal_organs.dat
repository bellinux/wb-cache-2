40|$|Even {{though the}} number of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> {{impairments}} who registered their disabilities is small, it has steadily increased, but their employment rate is still very low; in Japan, the kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments had increased since 1967 through 1998; and in South Korea, as the categories of disabilities have been expanded, those of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairment have been expanded. Even though the kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have been expanded and the population with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments has also increased, the studies on <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have not been actively carried out. Therefore, this study aimed {{to find out the}} tasks to promote the employment of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments in Japan and South Korea by analyzing the current situation of their employment and considering the problems in it, since the systems of both countries are similar. As for this study, the pertinent data to the employment of persons with disabilities that had been disclosed by both governments were analyzed and the precedent studies were collected and analyzed to find out its problems and tasks for the promotion of their employment. In the results of analyzing the current situation of the employment of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments and its problems in Japan and South Korea, {{it was found that the}} tasks have to be undertaken; the creation of diverse jobs that are proper for persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairmen...|$|R

40|$|In South Korea, the <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> {{impairments}} {{have six}} scopes including kidney, heart, respiratory organs, liver, colostomy and epilepsy. Among the total 2, 513, 000 persons who registered their disabilities, there are 117, 000 persons (4. 7 %) with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairment, which occupies the smallest portion among the entire registered disabled persons. The {{reason that the}} number of persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments is relatively small is because of the intricacy of the criteria for grading and procedure for registration. In results, persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments have not sufficiently taken advantage of the benefits from government and others comparing with persons with other types of disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to. understand the actual condition and problems of disability registration procedure and the criteria for grading and to make suggestions; {{to increase the number of}} registered persons with <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> impairments and to provide them with benefits and services of government, (1) the disability registration procedure needs to be simplified, (2) the disability grading system needs to be modified and the re-evaluation, and (3) the expansion of the category of disability...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to evaluate the}} calliandra leaves meal and shrimp head meal tolerance level on <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> characteristics of ducks. There were 30 alabio ducks aged 6 months old which were distributed into three treatments. The treatments were as follows R 1; 100 % Basal diet (BD), R 2 :BD+ 6 % of Calliandra leaves meal (K) + 3 % shrimp head meal (SH), R 3 :BD+ 6 %K+ 6 %SH. The results showed that there was neither significant effect of feeding Calliandra leaves meal and shrimp head meal on feed intake nor on <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> characteristics of alabio ducks (P> 0. 05). Histopathology observation showed that the morphological of liver, kidney, pancreas and reproductive tract were in normal category.

5000|$|This theorem is used, for example, in the {{analysis}} of medicalCT scans where a [...] "projection" [...] is an x-rayimage of an <b>internal</b> <b>organ.</b> The Fourier transforms of these images areseen to be slices through the Fourier transform of the 3-dimensionaldensity of the <b>internal</b> <b>organ,</b> and these slices can be interpolated to buildup a complete Fourier transform of that density. The inverse Fourier transformis then used to recover the 3-dimensional density of the object. This technique was first derived by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1956 for a radio astronomy problem.|$|R

There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the <b>internal</b> <b>organs,</b> removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChronic {{graft-versus-host disease}} (cGvHD) and {{systemic}} sclerosis (scleroderma [SSc]) share clinical characteristics, including skin and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> fibrosis. Fibrosis, {{regardless of the}} cause, is characterized by extracellular matrix deposition, of which collagen type I is the major constituent. The progressive accumulation of connective tissue results in destruction of normal tissue architecture and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> failure. In both SSc and cGvHD, the severity of skin and <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> fibrosis correlates with the clinical course of the disease. Thus, there is an unmet need for well-tolerated antifibrotic therapy. Halofuginone is an inhibitor of collagen type I synthesis in cells derived from various tissues and species and in animal models of fibrosis in which excess collagen {{is the hallmark of}} the disease. Halofuginone decreased collagen synthesis in the tight skin mouse (Tsk) and murine cGvHD, the 2 experimental systems that show many features resembling those of human GvHD. Inhibition of collagen synthesis by halofuginone is achieved by inhibiting transforming growth factor β-dependent Smad 3 phosphorylation. Dermal application of halofuginone caused a decrease in collagen content at the treated site of a cGvHD patient, and reduction in skin scores was observed in a pilot study with SSc patients. The results of the human studies provide basis for using halofuginone treatment for dermal fibrosis. As a first step toward future treatment of <b>internal</b> <b>organ</b> involvement, an oral administration study was performed in which halofuginone was well tolerated and plasma levels surpassed the predicted therapeutic exposure...|$|R
