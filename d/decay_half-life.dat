5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} cadmium {{is composed}} of 8 isotopes. Two of them are radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta <b>decay,</b> <b>half-life</b> is 7.7 × 1015 years) and 116Cd (two-neutrino double beta <b>decay,</b> <b>half-life</b> is 2.9 × 1019 years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both double electron capture), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes– 110Cd, 111Cd, and 112Cd– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being 113mCd (t1⁄2= 14.1 years), 115mCd (t1⁄2= 44.6 days), and 117mCd (t1⁄2= 3.36 hours).|$|E

50|$|One of {{the common}} fission {{products}} is 135Te, which undergoes beta <b>decay</b> with <b>half-life</b> of 19 seconds to 135I. 135I itself is a weak neutron absorber.

The yield of 135Xe for uranium fission is 6.3%; about 95% of 135Xe originates from decay of 135I.|$|R
5|$|The fission-survived isotope 298Fl, long {{expected}} to be doubly magic, is predicted to have alpha <b>decay</b> <b>half-life</b> around 17 days. The direct synthesis of the nucleus 298Fl by a fusion–evaporation pathway is currently impossible since no known combination of target and stable projectile can provide 184 neutrons in the compound nucleus, and radioactive projectiles such as calcium-50 (half-life fourteenseconds) cannot yet {{be used in the}} needed quantity and intensity. Currently, one possibility for the synthesis of the expected long-lived nuclei of copernicium (291Cn and 293Cn) and flerovium near the middle of the island include using even heavier targets such as curium-250, berkelium-249, californium-251, and einsteinium-254, that when fused with calcium-48 would produce nuclei such as 291Mc and 291Fl (as decay products of 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv), with just enough neutrons to alpha decay to nuclides close enough to the centre of the island to possibly undergo electron capture and move inwards to the centre, though the cross sections would be small and little is yet known about the decay properties of superheavy nuclides near the beta stability line. This may be the best hope currently to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability, but it is speculative and may or may not work in practice. Another possibility is to use controlled nuclear explosions to achieve the high neutron flux necessary to create macroscopic amounts of such isotopes. This would mimic the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability after polonium bypassed, as it would bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108). Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
25|$|Iodine-131 (131I) is an {{important}} radioisotope of iodine discovered by Glenn Seaborg and John Livingood in 1938 at the University of California, Berkeley. It has a radioactive <b>decay</b> <b>half-life</b> of about eight days. It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and treatment procedures, and natural gas production.

This is because I-131 is a major fission product of uranium and plutonium, comprising nearly 3% of the total products of fission (by weight). See fission product yield for a comparison with other radioactive fission products. I-131 is also a major fission product of uranium-233, produced from thorium.|$|E
