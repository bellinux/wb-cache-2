40|$|ObjectiveSince the 1960 s, {{multiple}} {{studies have}} reported a tendency toward hypertelorism in individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs). However, the association between specific cleft types and increased interorbital distance has been inconsistent. Using 3 D surface imaging, we tested whether different forms of clefting showed evidence of increased interorbital distance. MethodsIntercanthal and outercanthal distances and intercanthal indices were calculated from 3 D facial surface images of 287 individuals with repaired OFCs. Raw measurements were converted to sex and age-normalized Z-scores. Mean Z-scores for individuals with cleft lip (CL), cleft lip and palate (CLP) and cleft palate (CP) were compared to reference normative values (controls) and one another directly using t-tests and ANOVA. ResultsThe CLP group showed {{a significant increase in}} intercanthal width (p = 0. 001) and intercanthal index (p < 0. 001) compared to reference norms. The CP group showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001) in outercanthal width. The CL group showed no difference from reference norms. The proportion of clinically hyperteloric individuals was generally low, but highest in the CLP group (7. 4 %). Cleft severity had little effect on <b>interorbital</b> <b>spacing.</b> ConclusionsIndividuals with CLP exhibited on average a tendency toward mild hypertelorism, driven primarily by an increase in intercanthal distance. This tendency was not seen in CL or CP.

Its limbs are more or less distinctly cross-barred; the lower parts are uniformly whitish. Males are without vocal sacs. [...] Their length from snout to vent is about 2.5 in.|$|E
5000|$|The Persian leaf-toed gecko has a Snout rather acuminate, {{as long as}} the {{distance}} between the eye and the upper border of the ear-opening, 1.3 the diameter of the orbit; forehead concave; <b>interorbital</b> <b>space</b> very narrow; upper eyelid strongly fringed; ear-opening large, obliquely crescentic, the concavity being directed forwards and upwards, its diameter equalling three fourths that of the eye. Body and limbs moderate. Digits free, moderately dilated, inner well developed; infradigital lamellae obliquely curved; 10 lamellae under the thumb, 10 under the third finger, 9 under the inner toe, and 12 under the third toe. Snout covered with large convex granular scales, largest between the eye and the nostril; hinder part of head with minute granules, and scattered ones of a larger size. Rostral four times as broad as deep (having fused with the anterior labial on each side); nostril above the rostral, between the latter and three nasals; 10 or 11 upper and 9 lower labials; mental large, triangular, twice {{as long as the}} adjacent labial, its point between two large chin-shields which are in contact behind it; a small chin-shield {{on each side of the}} large pair. Upper surface of body covered -with small irregular flat grannies and moderately large, trihedral, strongly keeled tubercles arranged in 14 or 16 rather irregular longitudinal series the largest tubercles measure about one fourth the diameter of the eye. Abdominal scales small, smooth, rounded, imbricate. Male with a shore angular series of 8 preanal pores. Tail cylindrical, tapering, covered above with small, irregular, imbricate smooth scales and scattered pointed tubercles forming four or six longitudinal series, beneath with a series of transversely dilated plates. Pale yellowish brown, with six faint brownish transverse narrow dorsal bands, the tubercles in these areas being almost black; a dark brown streak from the nostrils through the eye above the ear, with a whitish line above it; lips whitish.|$|E
