5|$|The Lee Dining Room is {{used for}} formal banquets. It is lit by an 1825 Irish crystal chandelier. One hundred place {{settings}} of fine china and 150 place settings of sterling silver flatware were acquired from Tiffany & Co. in 1988 for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the house}} has nine {{bathrooms}} and one elevator, which {{were taken from the}} Mellon Mansion. Also taken from the Mellon Mansion were two fireplaces. The one was carved in Italy from lava of Mt. Vesuvius and is located in the community room. The other, located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> on the first floor, was carved out of red Michigan sandstone by an Italian-American sculptor.|$|E
5|$|Skagens Museum {{was founded}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908. Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, {{proprietor}} of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected {{to form the}} first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation {{was used as a}} museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> works on permanent public display {{there were other}} works and continuously revolving exhibitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> and <b>the</b> 52nd Street entrance walls which have included works by Joan Miró, paintings by Frank Stella, Ronnie Landfield, Robert Indiana, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, amongst several others.|$|R
50|$|A doorway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> {{south side}} opens into the {{southern}} end of the building, containing two bedrooms separated by a bathroom. A one-story enclosed porch dating from after 1957 - the 1957 newspaper photograph does not show it - projects southward from the easterly of the two bedrooms.|$|R

5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The dining room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the dining room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, Skagen {{became the}} summer venue of a group of artists who were {{attracted}} by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
50|$|The band {{recorded}} its 2008 album, Made Upwards, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor's mansion.|$|R
50|$|Internally, Fernside's core remains {{reasonably}} intact. Some original detail remains, including moulded pressed metal ceilings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{living and}} <b>dining</b> <b>rooms.</b> Fireplaces, one with moulded timber surrounds and another with marble surrounds and consoles, are situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living and <b>dining</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and carved wooden screen. It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. Panelled in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The alabaster chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E
25|$|His 1868 {{painting}} The Luncheon was posed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the Manet house.|$|E
50|$|A {{caricature}} of Maddox was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of <b>the</b> Hollywood Brown Derby Restaurant next to Paul Whiteman, Rudy Vallee, Hank Williams, and Bill Haley.|$|R
50|$|The French cuisine {{is offered}} {{either as a}} prix fixe or an a la carte menu. The {{restaurant}} {{is well known for}} its exclusivity. There are 12 tables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem is}} <b>the</b> table cloth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> {{that had been}} over starched and was {{impossible}} to iron with the public only noticing the creases and not the magnificent table settings.|$|R
25|$|Hsi Lai Temple offers {{community}} service {{to a variety}} of people in need of hours. Jobs range from cleaning and sweeping around the temple to serving lunch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|The regular {{entertainment}} {{provided at}} dinner is a pianist (dressed in a tuxedo if male). Local Yosemite artist, Dudley Kendall played piano <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at the Ahwahnee {{for years and}} had his work displayed at the hotel.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated {{inclusions}} in Dorchester House was the chimneypiece <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> sculptured by Alfred Stevens (see picture at right). It was regarded as one of his finest works. The Magazine of Art in 1883 contained the following comment.|$|E
50|$|In 1914 Rolf Henderson {{became the}} Headmaster and his {{portrait}} painted by his brother, Keith, a Scottish artist, hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>In</b> many ways Rolf {{was the first}} true Headmaster of St Peters.|$|R
2500|$|Sayre states [...] "that {{while the}} male staff at King's lunched in a large, comfortable, rather clubby <b>dining</b> room" [...] <b>the</b> female staff of all ranks [...] "lunched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> student's hall {{or away from}} the premises". Elkin states {{that most of the}} MRC group {{typically}} ate lunch together (including Franklin) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mixed <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> discussed below. And Maddox states, of Randall, [...] "He liked to see his flock, men and women, come together for morning coffee, and at lunch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> joint <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> where he ate with them nearly every day." [...] Francis Crick also commented that [...] "her colleagues treated men and women scientists alike." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the school}} grew, so more {{boarding}} houses were established or constructed: Norris House in 1924, Medway and Marshall in 1925, Echyngham in 1930 and Guldeford <b>in</b> 1936. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was also built <b>in</b> 1936 with <b>the</b> school hall following in 1938.|$|R
25|$|Gaineswood {{is on the}} National Register of Historic Places and was {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

Severe moisture damage to the ceiling and dome <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was corrected under a Save America's Treasures grant.|$|E
25|$|When {{the boys}} arrive home from school, June {{can be found}} in the kitchen {{chopping}} salad vegetables, basting a roast, or icing a cake. Her kitchen is immaculate. Like most TV middle class sitcom families of the era, the Cleavers eat breakfast and lunch in the kitchen while their dinners are full scale affairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1882, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, and her husband, {{the then}} Governor General of Canada, {{were the first}} members of the Royal Family to pass through what would become Saskatchewan. During {{a stop at the}} not yet named {{territorial}} capital, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the Royal Train, Princess Louise named the new community Regina, after her mother, Queen Victoria.|$|E
50|$|After a break Morou (together {{with his}} brother) opened Kora, serving trattoria style Italian food. Four days a week, Farrah Olivia is opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of Kora, {{featuring}} a more menu like <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old Farrah Olivia.|$|R
500|$|While Isaac Ellwood lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home large dinner parties, popular {{during the}} 19th century, were commonplace. The Ellwood House hosted {{prominent}} visitors throughout Isaac Ellwood's residence there. Theodore Roosevelt <b>dined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ellwood House <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> {{while he was}} a candidate for Vice President of <b>the</b> United States <b>in</b> 1900. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> has also hosted U.S. Senators and U.S. state governors among other notable guests. Dinner parties at the Ellwood House followed customs typical to [...] 19th century dinner partie. Guests [...] "dressed" [...] for the party, followed proper etiquette and were expected to know how to use the silverware properly.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> fall of 2016 {{he opened}} Allora Italian Kitchen and Bar, a 6,500-square-foot, high ceilinged space at 210-35 26th Ave. will seat 240 diners, {{including}} 12 at the pizza bar, 12 at the regular bar and another 65 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{few days}} before Mr. Jardine’s {{departure}} from Canton, the entire foreign community entertained him at a dinner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the East India Company’s Factory. About eighty persons of all nationalities, including India, were present, {{and they did not}} separate until several hours after midnight. It was an event frequently referred to afterwards amongst the residents, and to this day there are a few of us who still speak of it.|$|E
25|$|Extensive housing {{construction}} {{occurred in the}} 1920s. The houses featured enclosed front porches, open back porches and stained-glass windows in the living rooms. Most of the houses were detached or semi-detached (very close to the neighboring house, but not sharing a common wall) built to roughly the same plan, with the living room, dining room and kitchen all in line and three bedrooms and a bath upstairs. The stairs were usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> One of the builders was named Weyerman.|$|E
25|$|When saying Kiddush, {{the blessing}} over the wine (or over the bread) precedes the blessing over the day. One {{does not need}} to wash his hands before saying Kiddush but he should wash them after. The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it and {{anything}} that comes into contact with it be rendered ritually unclean. Following the meal, all the crumbs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> should be thoroughly swept up, then those involved should wash their hands.|$|E
50|$|Counselors also resided with <b>the</b> {{students}} <b>in</b> bedrooms {{adjacent to}} their respective dormitories to give round-the-clock support. The counselors, like the students, also attended regular individual and group therapy sessions {{to allow them to}} analyze their own methods and thought to improve. This is a practice which continues to this day.Bettelheim also believed that the Orthogenic School should feel like a home to <b>the</b> students. Furniture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dormitories was usually antique and very expensive. Students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>dined</b> on imported china with metal silverware and glass cups, which was unusual for a treatment center. During the three renovations to the building which Bettelheim supervised, a number of art pieces were commissioned for the school by Bettelheim, including a mural by Jordi Bonet.|$|R
50|$|A small {{addition}} {{containing a}} bathroom has {{made to the}} rear of the house and some internal walls have been removed or altered. Although the chimneys are no longer present, presumably having been lost when the house was rotated, a tiered corner fireplace remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|Edmonds and Winfield {{continued}} to partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restaurant {{business with the}} opening of Winfield's Gathering Place in Kirkwood, Missouri as a BBQ-style restaurant. It does not promote Edmonds' celebrity brand. In fact, there are no Edmonds, Cardinals or other sports memorabilia although there are televisions <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and <b>the</b> bar area for watching games.|$|R
