40|$|Electrical {{conductive}} textile coatings with variable {{amounts of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are presented. Formulations of textile coatings were prepared {{with up to}} 15 [*]wt % of CNT, based on the solid weight of the binder. The binders are water based polyacrylate dispersions. The CNTs were mixed into the <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion</b> starting from a commercially available aqueous CNT dispersion that {{is compatible with the}} <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Coating formulations with variable CNT concentrations were applied on polyester and cotton woven and knitted fabrics by different textile coating techniques: direct coating, transfer coating, and screen printing. The coatings showed increasing electrical conductivity with increasing CNT concentration. The coatings can be regarded to be electrically conductive (sheet resistivity< 103 [*]Ohm/sq) starting at 3 [*]wt% CNT. The degree of dispersion of the carbon nanotubes particles inside the coating was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. The CNT particles form honeycomb structured networks in the coatings, proving a high degree of dispersion.

40|$|Results of a {{study on}} the {{influence}} of process parameters such as impeller speed, granulation time and binder viscosity on granule strength and properties are reported. A high shear granulator (Cyclomix manufactured by Hosokawa Micron B. V., The Netherlands) has been used to produce granules. Calcium carbonate (Durcal) was used as feed powder and aqueous polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the binder. The dried granules have been analysed for their strength, density and size distribution. The results show that increasing the granulation time has a great affect on granules strength, until an optimum time has been reached. The underlying cause is an increase in granule density. Granules are consolidated more at higher impeller speeds. Moreover, the granule size distribution seems not to be affected significantly by an increase in impeller speed. Granules produced with high binder viscosity have a considerably lower strength, wide strength distribution due to poor <b>dispersion</b> of <b>binder</b> on the powder bed. Binder addition methods have showed no considerable effect on granule strength or on granule size distribution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCefuroxime axetil (CA) is an ester prodrug of {{cefuroxime}} with {{an unpleasant}} taste when administrated orally. This work was {{to mask the}} bitter taste of CA and enhance its oral bioavailability. Dry suspensions were prepared by means of wet granulation method and solid <b>dispersion</b> method. <b>Binders,</b> suspending agents and other compositions involved in the formulation were optimized. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that CA was amorphous in the solid dispersion with stearic acid as the carrier, which contributed to an improvement of the dissolution rate. Taste evaluation was performed by three volunteers and taste masking was successfully achieved by the methods mentioned above. A pH 7. 0 phosphate buffer was adopted to study the in vitro dissolution performance of the three formulations, i. e., two self-made dry suspensions and the commercial one. With a better release characteristic and a satisfying taste masking ability, the solid dispersion suspension {{was selected as the}} optimal formulation for the further pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs. The values of Cmax and AUC 0 – 12 for the solid dispersion suspension were about 1. 78 -fold and 2. 17 -fold higher than these of reference suspension, respectively. The obtained results demonstrated that the solid dispersion can efficiently mask the bitter taste of CA and significantly enhance its oral bioavailability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA key {{difference}} in detergent agglomeration compared to most agglomeration processes {{conducted in the}} food and pharmaceutical industries is the ultra-high viscosity of the surfactant binder. In comparison to water, these surfactants are about 1000 times more viscous. This makes handling the surfactant paste a challenge. The present study aims to {{understand the importance of}} initial <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Experimental work has revealed how the binder deforms, breaks and assimilates in mass by gathering more powder. The rate of powder assimilation was determined {{as a function of the}} agitation intensity. At higher impeller speeds this rate is faster. The influence of the method of binder delivery on granule attributes such as size and strength was also investigated. The binder was either injected into the mixer as a stream/jet or preloaded into the mixer in the form of blobs. At moderate agitation intensity the results showed that binder injection results in faster and steadier granule growth (size), thus demonstrating the influence of binder delivery method on the kinetics of the granulation process...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparison}} to weaving or other techniques that are employed to embed conductive tracks in textile fabric structure, the obvious advantages of printing the desired conductive pattern are {{the simplicity of}} the process and the suitability for low volume production runs as well as high volume production runs. However, the generally inferior durability and poorer electrical performance of conductive inks that have been printed onto a textile fabric give rise to challenges. In this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment were used to formulate screen printing inks for use on textiles. On an equal weight basis, electrically conductive grades impart higher electrical conductivity compared to the printing ink grades of carbon black pigment. However, the conductive grades of carbon black are difficult to disperse and stabilise in aqueous media. Therefore in this study, a procedure was devised initially to prepare stable, waterborne dispersions of a number of highly conductive grades of carbon black pigment. The stability of pigment dispersions was characterised by conducting rheological, particle size and accelerated gravitational sedimentation analyses on appropriate formulations. In order to formulate finished inks from the optimised, stable pigment <b>dispersions,</b> various <b>binders</b> were incorporated in the formulations followed by characterisation of the stability and the electrical properties of the finished inks. Films of the formulated inks were deposited onto various textile substrates. This was followed by testing of the washing and creasing performance of these ink films. It was found that the formulated inks performed considerably better than the tested commercial inks. It was shown that following the ink preparation procedure devised in this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment can be used to formulate textile printing inks which not only possess very high electrical conductivity but are also durable to withstand washing and creasing of textiles...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in smart textiles is to develop suitable multifunctional materials that can address simultaneously several characteristics such as durability, stretchability, lightweight, and conductivity. Conductive polymers which showed success in different technological fields like polymer solar cells and light emitting diodes are promising in many smart textile applications. In this work, we treated a common polyamide/lycra knitted fabric with PEDOT:PSS for stretchable e-textiles. PEDOT:PSS, with DMSO as a conductivity enhancer and different ratios of water-based polyurethane <b>dispersions</b> as a <b>binder,</b> {{was applied to the}} fabric with simple immersion and coating applications. The effect of different application methods and binder ratio on the surface resistance of the fabric was monitored with four point probe electrical surface resistance measurement systems. Samples prepared by immersion technique are more uniform and have higher conductivity than those prepared by a coating technique. SEM images showed that PEDOT:PSS is incorporated into the structure in the immersion method while in the coating it is majorly present {{on the surface of the}} fabric. The tensile measurement showed that the acidic PEDOT:PSS and polyurethane dispersion coating has no adverse effect on the tensile strength of the fabric. The coated samples can be stretched up to 700 % while still reasonably conductive. The resistance increases only by a small amount when samples were stretched cyclically by stretching 100 %. Generally, samples prepared by the immersion method maintained better conductivity while stretching than those by a coating method. The washing fastness of the samples was also assessed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn wet {{granulation}} processes, coatings or binders generally consist of mixtures of various raw materials that confer or enhance specific properties {{to the final}} product. Typically, a coating solution is composed of water, film forming polymer (such as hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose, HPMC) and filler (such as stearic acid, SA). One of the important issues in {{wet granulation}} processes is {{the stability of the}} aqueous coating (or <b>binder)</b> <b>dispersion.</b> An unstable dispersion results in the agglomeration of the colloidal particles, thereby affecting the film coating properties and eventually the coating process. In this study, we use dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to elucidate the structure of aqueous colloidal formulations. DPD is a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation method where the materials are described as a set of soft beads interacting according to the Flory–Huggins (1942) model. The DPD simulation results are compared to experimental results obtained by Cryogenic-SEM and particle size distribution analysis. It is shown from the DPD simulation results that the HPMC polymer is able to form a layer that covers SA particles and thus produces stable colloids. Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) also covers SA agglomerate but it is not able to diffuse inside its inner core. The agglomerate structure is characterized via the density distribution and the polymer chain end-to-end distance. Experimental results show similar trends; particle size distribution analysis shows that in the presence of HPMC, the majority of SA particles are below 1 μm in diameter, also MCC is able to prevent the formation of big SA agglomerates and may be a better stabilizing agent than HPMC. SEM images reveal that HPMC surrounds SA agglomerates with a hatching textured film and anchors on their surface...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A process {{for the production of}} a transparent wood-coating material involves doping a physically drying or radiation-crosslinkable acrylate resin binder with highly efficient, light-stable laser dye(s) {{in the form of a}} 0. 1 - 5. 0 wt% (based on total composition) molecular <b>dispersion</b> in the <b>binder</b> and then adding photoinitiator(s), auxiliary substance(s) and optionally solvents. The dyes used show complete or selective absorption of light in the wavelength range between 280 and 500 nm, converting this with an efficiency of at least 30 % into longer-wavelength radiation which does not damage the wood substrate or the binder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for similar materials in which the binder is a medium- to long-oil alkyd resin based on drying fatty acids and/or drying oils (in this case without photoinitiators). USE - For the production of weather-resistant transparent coatings on wood, e. g. cladding, windows, doors and panelling etc. ADVANTAGE - Enables the production of transparent coatings which provide a high level of protection from light (even in the blue part of the spectrum), by converting this into longer-wavelength light which does not damage the wood (by degradation of lignin) or the coating material itself. This protection is achieved without using pigments, thus retaining the grain of the wood, and the thickness of the coating is matched with the concentration of the dye, resulting in a cost-effective coating process (especially with economical UV-curing systems) ...|$|R
40|$|In the 25 {{years since}} the {{original}} paper was written, there have been considerable technical advances in foundry binder technology as well as sand mixing and processing equipment. The techniques and equipment available to the foundrymen in 1974 were rather primitive compared to today's improved binder chemistry and selection, mixing and binder metering equipment and sand reclamation technology This paper updates the original 1974 research on porosity susceptibility of gray and ductile iron castings prepared with cores bonded with the then newly developed urethane types of no bake binders. The 1974 study was aimed at delineating the effects of core and mold making variables on porosity susceptibility {{and the development of}} remedial practices to eliminate binder-related defects when they occur. Also investigated were the effects of casting variables and how these relate to the occurrence of such defects. The updated research focused on the evaluation of current resin technology, iron oxide additions, and the effects of porosity inhibiting ferroalloys. Lastly, other unpublished research by the author during the ensuing 25 years is also included. New and improved binder formulations of 1998 provided virtually identical casting results compared to the 1974 research. Binder ratios of polyol resin to polyisocyanate component less than one (favoring higher levels of the polyisocyanate component) tended to increase overall porosity susceptibility. Balanced or ratios (greater than one) were, in general, not susceptible to defect formation. Defect formation was enhanced by high pouring temperatures, especially when polyol to polyisocyanate ratios were less than one and when high binder levels were employed. Poor <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion</b> from sand mixing was also responsible for increasing the overall susceptibility to these types of defects. Porosity defects resulting from employment of unfavorable binder and/or casting practices could be eliminated by adding relatively small additions of red iron oxide (hematite or Fe 2...|$|R
40|$|Development of a {{profitable}} titanium industry for New Zealand {{will not come}} about without innovative technologies. Plastic injection moulding has long held a place in NZ manufacturing to produce large quantities of complex parts and holds the key to such innovation. Titanium metal parts were fabricated by injection moulding titanium based metal powder feedstock followed by a debinding process and subsequent sintering. The fabrication process in its entirety was investigated in four distinct steps. Feedstock formulation involved combining the metal powders with various carrier components. Injection moulding enabled the shaping of the feedstock into geometries approximating the final part. Debinding being the process whereby the carrier/binder system {{is removed from the}} part to create a powder compact retaining the required geometry. Sintering being the final step where the metal powders are consolidated into a fully dense metal part of net shape. The feedstock binder consisted of water soluble polyethylene glycol that reduced feedstock viscosity, improved particle wetting, aided greenpart shape retention and eliminated toxic solvents in debinding. Carnauba wax and bees wax aided dispersion, lubricated particles, were safe to handle and better for the environment (than petroleum waxes). Their low melt temperatures aided removal during thermal debinding and supported residue elimination. By optimising the ratio of water soluble, wax and polyolefin binder components (3 : 2 : 1 respectively) for melt flow and pellet formation, greenparts defect free with uniform particle distribution were made. The optimal binder system proved suitable for titanium alloy and irregular shape pure titanium powders (hydride-de-hydride). Increasing powder loading (wP = (0. 60 to 0. 65)) had no appreciable effect on viscosity while enabling feedstock with good uniformity and pellet formation. Dimensional change was not affected by uniformity of the feedstock however molecular weight, volume and <b>dispersion</b> of <b>binder</b> components affected interparticular distances. Low processing temperatures reduced disruption to part geometry, benefitted particle bonding and helped retain handling strength. The use of low temperatures for thermal debinding (t = 250 °C) enabled removal of the binder below the temperatures that facilitate interstitial diffusion and oxide/carbide formation, although part thickness, mass and overall volume effected the processing time. A strong correlation was seen between handling strength of the greenparts and defects, such as non-uniform density distribution and cracking after sintering. Sintering was essential to produce the final part and showed that a binder free brownpart was not the only criteria for eliminating impurities. The furnace atmosphere must remain free from contamination to eliminate transfer back to the parts. This was addressed using an argon sweep gas, however, the design and efficacy of the system was considered inadequate. Decomposition products need to be removed quickly from the furnace as they evolve before impurities from the sweep gas diffuse back into the parts during the extended duration at sinter temperatures (t = 1300 °C). The combination of an optimised titanium feedstock and the use of a low temperature thermal debinding technique produced a consolidated MIM part of relatively large dimensions. The parts were seen to have uniform microstructure throughout the cross-section with density comparable to that of MIM standards. In difference to the literature, a high powder loading (φp = 0. 65) of HDH powders was used and shown to be readily mouldable. The higher powder loading also eliminate separation defects and shape distortions evident using lower amounts of powder...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} of particle size enlargement whereby a liquid binder is added onto agitated powder beds to facilitate granule formation. This PhD thesis studies the foam granulation process, where the liquid binder is added as an aqueous foam. The investigation into foam granulation technology begins with a literature review on both the foam and wet granulation disciplines, followed by a series of experimental studies. The experimental studies are divided into a few different stages, starting with small scale experiments investigating single nucleus formation on static powder beds, followed by nuclei formation by a nucleation-only mechanism on real moving powder beds, foam granulation at a wide range of material and process conditions, and case studies investigating moisture and drug distribution in granules, with the primary aim to develop understanding of the mechanisms controlling (foam) <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion</b> and nucleation during foam granulation. It was discovered that the liquid drainage rate is the rate limiting step during foam penetration. Large binder concentration and/or fme powder particles are associated with a slow foam penetration process, which also give rise to the formation of fine nuclei. Nucleation via foam penetration on static powder beds was shown to provide better liquid usage and improve liquid distribution efficiency compared to the nucleation via drops on lactose powder. From the study of nuclei formation on a real moving powder bed, it was proposed that wetting and nucleation during foam granulation involves "foam drainage" and "mechanical dispersion" controlled mechanisms. Foam granulation limited to a nucleation-only mechanism was demonstrated to be able to create nuclei with uniform, narrow size distributions. The proposition of "foam drainage" and "mechanical dispersion" controlled mechanisms was verified in a series of foam granulation experiments using a wide range of material and process properties, which showed that the mechanisms can influence the initial nuclei size distribution as well as the final granule size distribution. It was discovered that increasing the liquid to solid ratio, decreasing the foam quality, increasing the primary particle size, decreasing the binder concentration and decreasing the impeller speed all have an equivalent effect in increasing the average granule size and the spread of granule size distribution. Two independent case studies have demonstrated the potential of foam granulation to achieve unifonn moisture and drug distribution in granules. Comparison between foam and spray granulation also found the differences in the wetting and nucleation mechanisms involved, and identified the major contribution to granule heterogeneity. Transfonnation and regime maps have been proposed to explain foam granulation behaviour. On the basis of the two wetting and nucleation mechanisms - "foam drainage" and mechanical dispersion" controlled mechanisms, the transfonnation maps summarizes the effects of material and process properties on the nuclei granule size distribution. A regime map is presented for to show the regimes of operation for the key rate processes involved in foam granulation and spray granulation. The maps should prove to be useful for foam granulation design, and act as the foundation for future study...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} nucleation regime map to determine the controlling nucleation mechanism as a function of material properties and operating parameters. Two distinct regimes of nucleation were identified. The drop controlled nucleation regime occurs when nucleation conditions are ideal and one drop produces one nucleus granule and the controlling property is the droplet size. The nuclei formation kinetics are fast and the binder droplets penetrate into the powder bed pores almost immediately. In this region, the nuclei distribution reflects the drop size distribution as one drop tends to form one granule provided that (a) drops hitting the powder surface do not overlap - low spray flux Ya and (b) the drop must wet into the bed completely before bed mixing brings it into contact with another partially absorbed drop on the bed surface - low penetration time tp. If either criterion is not met, powder mixing characteristics will dominate. In the mechanical dispersion regime, the viscous or poorly wetting binder is slow to flow through the powder pores and form nuclei and good mixing is required for <b>binder</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The kinetics of nuclei formation were characterised using a simple drop penetration time test. A single drop of binder fluid was placed on a loosely packed powder bed and the time taken for the fluid to penetrate completely was measured for a range of powder and binder combinations. Loosely packed powder beds contain large macrovoids which are included in the existing Kozeny approach to estimating pore size. However it was found that these pores do not participate in liquid flow. A new two phase model was proposed where the total volume of the macrovoids was assumed to be the difference between the bed porosity and the tap porosity. A new parameter, the effective porosity eeff, was defined as the tap porosity multiplied by the estimated fraction of pores that terminate at a macrovoid and are effectively blocked pores. The pore sizes and drop penetration times were recalculated using the effective porosity and the predicted tp values were generally within an order of magnitude of the experimental results for all powders. The drop penetration time is reduced by small drops, low viscosity fluids, porous powders (but without macrovoids), large powder pores, high surface tension, low contact angle and pre-wetting of the powder bed. A new dimensionless group, the dimensionless spray flux Ya was defined to characterise the three most important operating variables in binder dispersion: liquid binder flowrate, drop size and powder flux through the spray zone. At low Ya, the majority of drops land on the powder sufficiently well separated to allow ideal drop controlled nucleation where one drop forms one granule. As Ya increases, the probability of drop footprints overlapping to give larger agglomerate nuclei increases. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to validate the spray flux theory. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops falls exponentially as Ya increases and to remain in the drop controlled regime Ya must be kept below 0. 1. Analytical solutions based on the Poisson distribution for the fraction of single drop nuclei as a function of Ya were an excellent match with the Monte-Carlo data. Further validation experiments in carefully designed ex-granulator experiments and in an industrial granulator were performed. The results matched the theoretical solutions and demonstrated the ability of Ya to describe the nucleation zone in a real granulator. The proposed nucleation regime map demonstrated the interaction between drop penetration time and spray flux in nucleation. At short penetration times, such as the water and lactose system, decreasing Ya causes a shift towards the drop controlled regime and a narrower nuclei distribution. When penetration time is long, the nuclei size distribution is always larger and broader. Granulation may still be successful if the mechanical dispersion forces are able to break up the binder clumps and distribute the binder through the powder. The nucleation regime map should prove to be a useful tool for maintaining effective liquid distribution during scale-up as well as a useful trouble-shooting tool. It allows the dominant mechanism controlling the nucleation process to be easily identified using relatively simple parameters and a rational approach can then be used to control the properties of the nuclei...|$|R
