5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect <b>head-rest</b> usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the course}} of 1943, a number of {{improvements}} were gradually introduced. In an attempt to increase the pilot's field of view an armoured glass <b>head-rest,</b> the so-called Galland Panzer was developed, and subsequently began replacing the bulky armour plate {{in the spring of}} 1943. Towards {{the end of the year}} the clear-view, three-panel Erla Haube canopy appeared, named after the Erla Maschinenwerk sub-contractor involved in building new examples, and upgrading older examples of the Bf 109. Often misnamed the [...] "Galland Hood" [...] in postwar Western aviation books and periodicals, it eventually replaced the older heavily framed two-piece canopy — comprising the starboard side-hinged six-panel main canopy, and the three-panel fixed rear unit fixed to the fuselage — on the Bf 109G. The canopy structure was completely redesigned to incorporate a greater area of clear perspex; the welded framing for the three-panel Erla Haube design was reduced to a minimum and there was no longer a fixed rear portion, with the entire structure aft of the windscreen being hinged to swing to starboard when opened.|$|E
6000|$|Small shields of the Greek {{historic}} period are [...] "unknown to Homer," [...] Mr. Leaf says, [...] "with a {{very few}} curious exceptions," [...] [Footnote: Iliad, vol. i. p. 575.] detected by Reichel in Book X. 15 [Footnote: Ibid, vol. i. p. 569, fig. 2.], where Diomede's men sleep with their heads resting on their shields, whereas a big- bellied Mycenaean shield rises, he says, too high for a pillow.

The Zulu wooden <b>head-rest</b> is of the same character. Thus this passage in Book X. does not prove that small circular shields were known to Homer, nor does X. 5 13. 526-530, an obscure text in which it is uncertain whether Diomede and Odysseus ride or drive the horses of Rhesus. They could ride, as every one must see, even though equipped with great body-covering shields. True, the shielded hero could neither put his shield at his back nor in front of him when he rode; but he could hang it sidewise, when it would cover his left side, as in the early Middle Ages (1060-1160 A.D.).|$|E

He had put them into awkward and constrained attitudes, of course; and they all looked as if they had the instrument of torture which photographers call a <b>head-rest</b> under their occiputs. Here and there an elderly lady's face was a mere blur; and some of the younger children had twitched themselves into wavering shadows, and might have passed for spirit-photographs of their own little ghosts.

Other wide-ranging projects in that decade contributed to making his work widely recognisable: award-winning book covers like for the Czech classic The Grandmother by Božena Němcová, his contribution to Aurel Klimt‘s animated film version of Jan Werich’s Fimfárum, and his embellishment of Prague-Žižkov’s famed tavern “At the Shot Out Eye” (U vystřelenýho oka), where his conceptions adorn everything from the tables to the <b>head-rests</b> he invented for the urinals.|$|R

Turkeys were crated at 83 kg/m 2 and exposed to conditions for 8 hours before processing. Three replications (8 birds) were performed per treatment for each gender, and between-sex comparisons were made within treatments. Significance was declared at p≤ 0. 05. Core body temperature (CBT), live shrink (LS), and delta blood glucose (BG) were assessed; meat quality measures included thigh and breast pH and L*, a*, and b* colour values. Behaviour {{was measured using}} instantaneous scan sampling during the last 4 h of treatment. LS in hens exposed to - 18 °C (2. 9 %) was greater than those at 20 °C (1. 5 %). Thigh pH was higher after - 18 °C exposure (hens: 6. 39; toms: 6. 08) than after 20 °C. In the cold-exposed hens, breast L* values were lower, while thigh a* and breast b* values were higher than in both 20 °C treatments. Huddling, shivering, preening, and feather ptiloerection occurred more in cold-exposed turkeys. Between-sex comparison revealed lower LS and a larger decrease in BG in cold-exposed toms; meat characteristics also differed. After warm (28 °C) exposure, both hen and tom LS increased, and tom CBT rose approximately 1. 0 °C. Ultimate breast pH was unexpectedly higher in warm-exposed toms (5. 71 at 30 %, 5. 67 at 80 % RH) than those exposed to 20 °C (5. 71 and 5. 69), but lower with increased RH. In hens, initial breast pH increased with warmer temperature, while thigh a* decreased. Several differences in breast pH and a* were noted between sexes within a treatment, and hens had larger BG decreases than toms in both 20 °C conditions. In the 28 °C 80 % RH treatment, LS was higher in hens (3. 1 %) than in toms (2. 44 %).

The bedding consists of sedge and other monocotyledons topped with the leaves of Cryptocarya woodii Engl. Beds found in a preserved northern Scottish village, which were raised boxes made of stone and likely topped with comfortable fillers, were dated to between 3200 BC and 2200 BC.

40|$|Although opioid-induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (OINV) is common and debilitating, its mechanism is still unclear. Recently, we suggested that opioids affect semicircular canal function {{and that this}} leads to a mismatch between canal input and other sensory information during head motion, which triggers OINV. Here, we assess if visual input is relevant for this mismatch. In a randomized-controlled crossover study 14 healthy men (26. 9 ± 3. 4 years, mean±SD) were tested twice, once blindfolded and once with eyes open, with at least one-day washout. The opioid remifentanil was administered intravenously (0. 15 μg/kg/min) for 60 minutes. After a thirty-minutes resting period, subjects' head and trunk were passively moved. Nausea was rated before remifentanil start (T 0), before the movement intervention (T 30) and after 60 minutes (T 60) of administration. At rest (T 0, T 30), median nausea ratings were zero whether subjects were blindfolded or not. Movement triggered nausea independently of visual input (nausea rating 1. 5 / 3. 0 (median/interquartile range) in the blindfolded, 2. 5 / 6 in the eyes-open condition, χ 2 (1) = 1. 3, p = 0. 25).

40|$|Abstract—For {{wheelchair}} users {{unable to}} transfer to a vehicle seat, the wheelchair serves {{as a means of}} mobility and postural support during activities of daily living and as a seating support in a vehicle. The performance of commer-cially available adaptive seating components in a dynamic or impact situation, as well as their effect on the safety of the user, is unknown and should be determined. The main objective of the project was to develop a test methodology to statically determine the crashworthiness of wheelchair <b>head-rest</b> systems and show the efficacy of that methodology by applying it to several commercially available headrest sys-tems. The methodology was based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) test conditions, which use static test procedures to ensure that vehicle head restraints will perform adequately during actual crash conditions. The procedure developed to evaluate the headrests gave informative and repeatable results. The tests performed calculated the energy associated with a critical deformation of the headrest under quasi-static conditions. The results were used to determine the level of safety provided by the devices and to recommend design improvements. The headrests tested exhibited similar modes of deformation due to bending of a vertical adjustment bar, and several devices were determined to be capable of providing adequate restraint in an impact situation. Key words: physical disability, postural support, vehicle transport, wheelchair. This material is based upon work supported by the National Institute o...|$|E
