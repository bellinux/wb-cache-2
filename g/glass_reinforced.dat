40|$|A generic {{static and}} impact {{experimental}} procedure {{has been developed}} in this work aimed at improving the stability of <b>glass</b> fabric <b>reinforced</b> epoxy shell structures by bonding with axial stiffeners. Crashworthy structures fabricated from composite laminate with stiffeners would offer energy absorption superior to metallic structures under compressive loading situations. An experimental material characterisation of the <b>glass</b> fabric <b>reinforced</b> epoxy composite under uni-axial tension {{has been carried out}} in this study. This work provides a numerical simulation procedure to describe the static and dynamic response of unstiffened <b>glass</b> fabric <b>reinforced</b> epoxy composite shell (without stiffeners) and stiffened <b>glass</b> fabric <b>reinforced</b> epoxy composite shell (with axial stiffeners) under static and impact loading using the Finite Element Method. The finite element calculation for the present study was made with ANSYS®-LS-DYNA® software.

25|$|In the 20th century, {{new types}} of glass such as {{laminated}} <b>glass,</b> <b>reinforced</b> glass and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.

Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} rally car {{competitive}} into the 1980s an evolution version, the Chevette HSR, was developed which was successful {{for several more}} years. The modified cars featured <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> plastic (fibreglass) front and rear wings, spoiler, bonnet and tailgate (giving the HSR the nickname 'Plastic Fantastic'), revised suspension (particularly at the rear, where extra suspension links were fitted), and other minor changes. Group 4 evolution required a production run of 50 cars incorporating the new modifications; these were made by rebuilding unsold HSs and by modifying customers' vehicles. However, the merger of the Vauxhall and Opel marketing departments resulted in Dealer Team Vauxhall and Dealer Opel Team (DOT) joining to form GM Dealer Sport (GMDS); with the Chevette soon to be obsolete, Opel were able to force the cancellation of the HSR rally programme in favour of the Manta 400.|$|E
