40|$|Spacelab is a manned, {{reusable}} laboratory {{which is}} being developed for the European Space Agency (ESA). In its working mode it will fly in low earth orbit in the cargo bay of the Shuttle Transportation System (STS) Orbiter. A description is presented of the structural development of the various features of Spacelab. System requirements are considered along with structural requirements, quasi-static loads, acoustic loads, pressure loads, crash loads, ground loads, and the fatigue profile. Aspects of thermal environment generation are discussed, and questions regarding the design evolution <b>of</b> the <b>pallet</b> structure are examined. <b>Details</b> <b>of</b> <b>pallet</b> structure testing are reported, taking into account static strength tests, acoustic tests, the modal survey test, crash tests, and fatigue/fracture mechanics testing...|$|R

40|$|Closed-loop {{production}} systems {{are used in}} many factories, e. g., machining, adhesive manufacturing, plastic forming and assembly factories. In these systems, many pallets, jigs or molds circulate and are used repeatedly, and the number affects the system production rate. In this paper, we analyze {{the effect of a}} number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> and system parameters on the production rate, and present the existence of the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> which yields the maximum production rate. Next, we propose an approximation method for estimating the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>pallets,</b> for which the estimation error is very small and the estimated number gives almost the same production rate as that yielded by the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>pallets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> {{circulating}} {{in a closed}} loop production system {{is an important factor}} which affects the production rate. If the number is large, pallets stagnate in the system. If the number is small, an idling state occurs frequently in many stages. In both cases the production rate drops. Therefore, it is necessary to control the number <b>of</b> in-process <b>pallets</b> in the system according to the states <b>of</b> <b>pallet</b> flow and stages in order to maximize the production rate. In this paper, we study the effect <b>of</b> <b>pallet</b> input control for a closed loop production system with constant operation cycle time and stage breakdown. First, we model a pallet flow in the system by a Markov model, and analyze the maximum production rate yielded in the system and the optimum policy for pallet input control by a Markov decision process. Next, we present the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>pallet</b> input control comparing with the uncontrolled system. Finally, in order to investigate the effect of the number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> on the production rate, we analyze the production rate and the number <b>of</b> in-process <b>pallets</b> under the optimum policy using the reward function which consists of the production rate and the number <b>of</b> in-process <b>pallets.</b> The main results are as follows. (1) There is the optimum policy for pallet input control which yields the maximum production rate. (2) The pallet control is effective to increase the production rate and decrease the number <b>of</b> in-process <b>pallets.</b> (3) The decrease of the number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> monotonously reduces the production rate. However, if the buffer capacity is large, the reduction is very small near the maximum production rate...|$|R
30|$|To {{generate}} the pallet {{data from the}} information contained in a TPFDD line item, DALP-TS computes upper and lower bounds on the required number <b>of</b> <b>pallets.</b> The bounds indicate the smallest and largest number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> that could be created from the given cargo weight. In order to be a non-trivial load, pallets were assumed to have a lower weight bound of 2500  lb. The structural limitations <b>of</b> the <b>pallet</b> base, as well as most cargo aircraft, restrict the pallet upper weight limit to 10, 000  lb. Thus, if a TPFDD line item specified 63, 800  lb of cargo, the minimum number <b>of</b> possible <b>pallets</b> is: 63, 800 / 10, 000  =  7, and the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> is: 63, 800 / 2500  =  25. DALP-TS randomly selects an integer between these bounds (inclusive) as the total number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> and assigns a random weight between 2500 and 10, 000  lb to each pallet such that the sum <b>of</b> the <b>pallet</b> weights equals the specified weight by the TPFDD line item. Each pallet associated with a given TPFDD line item has identical temporal constraints.|$|R
40|$|In a cyclic {{manufacturing}} system, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> in a handling and locating pallet system (HLPS) {{can have a}} huge effect on the production cycle time. The complexity of calculating the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> that satisfies the minimal cycle time poses a challenging design problem. In this paper the optimal solution is presented for deterministic cyclic manufacturing systems having determined schedule of tasks for multi-product applications. Furthermore, a specific domain which includes the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> is obtained for any arbitrary schedule of various product types in an HLPS. To verify the optimal solution, a reconfigurable Colored Petri Net (CPN) model is developed for a simple X 85 pallet system. For various cases of machine processing times, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> is obtained for the suggested framework...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{abundance}} <b>of</b> wood <b>pallets</b> in today’s manufacturing and distribution system, the reckless disposal <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> {{calls for a}} sustainable disposal solution to better utilize the pallets and conserve resources.

40|$|Aim {{of study}} : Evaluate times and yields in the {{transformation}} of pine logs to pieces <b>of</b> <b>pallets.</b> Area <b>of</b> study: Four sawmills of the forest region of El Salto, Durango, Mexico. Material and methods :  The sample size was 388 logs with 32. 91 m 3 as volume without bark grouped in four diameter classes and five taper classes. The transformation time was estimated using the “Snap-back timing” method, and yield {{was defined as the}} ratio between pallets and log volume. Main results : The time required to obtain 1000 bft <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> is approximately 5. 8 hours and the mean yield is 56 %. This means that for each cubic meter of logs without bark, it is possible to obtain 240 board feet <b>of</b> <b>pallets</b> (bft). In addition, 4. 16 m 3 of logs without bark are required to obtain 1000 board feet <b>of</b> <b>pallets.</b> The estimated mean productivity was 0. 54 m 3 /h. Research highlights: As the log diameter increases, yield also increases. The taper of the logs was not significant {{in the transformation}} yield.
