In the last decade, theoretical works and practical experiments in wireless and cellular networks have convincingly proved that MIMO {{has been a real}} find in digital communications. Nowadays, MIMO {{principle is}} being applied to underwater acoustic communications (UAC) and it is showing encouraging results. But very few research has been done on the relation between different parameters of MIMO and its gain. Our primary purpose in this project is to analyse the MIMO gain theoretically using Shannon capacity analysis and suggest ways to maximize capacity with limited bandwidth by varying other parameters. As we will show in the later pages of this project that underwater acoustic channel (UAC) is highly selective in frequency, data transmission cannot be increased by simply increasing the transmission bandwidth. This difficult situation can be found in wireless communication where there is an increasingly large requirement in high speed data transfer but available bandwidth is constrained by the frequency allocation law. In those communication fields where radio frequency is used, this bandwidth limitation problem has been overcome by introducing MIMO techniques, which provide significant gain in data transmission rate while keeping the transmission Bandwidth constant. In the previous years, the contribution of MIMO to UAC systems has mostly been thoroughly analyzed via spatial modulation or multi-carrier modulation. Initial simulation and experimental results have showcased a larger gain over conventional single input single output (SISO) but the results strongly vary depending on the modulation scheme chosen by us and the receiver algorithm as well as the underwater channel environment...|$|R

However, empirical {{evidence on the}} effects of the generation of these <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> on firm performance remains scarce in the Information Systems and Management literature. Therefore, from a dynamic capability perspective, this paper examines whether companies' ability to leverage <b>digital</b> <b>data,</b> which we call their <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability, leads to better financial performance, and whether there are moderating effects on this relationship. In order to achieve these goals, the following research questions are addressed: 1) To what extent do firms that develop <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capabilities achieve better financial performance? 2) To what extent do organisational and industry-related environmental conditions moderate the relationship between a firm's <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability and financial performance? We empirically test our hypotheses through partial least square modelling using a financial database and a survey of sales managers from 125 firms. We find that the development of <b>Digital</b> <b>Data</b> dynamic capability provides value in terms of firm financial performance and that the moderating effects are influential: under high levels of dynamism and munificence in younger firms, the relationship is stronger. Overall, this study evaluates the potential business value of firm <b>digital</b> <b>data</b> use and addresses a lack of empirical evidence on this issue in the Information Systems literature.
