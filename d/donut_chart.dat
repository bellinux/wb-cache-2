40|$|Binocular {{summation}} is {{the basic}} mechanism underlying the use of monovision correction. In this experiment we have investigated the effect of uncorrected astigmatism (1. 00 DC) on binocular visual acuity with and without monovision. Low levels of uncorrected astigmatism have only a small effect on binocular visual acuity under normal binocular viewing conditions. However under monovision conditions, low levels of uncorrected astigmatism have a significantly greater effect on binocular visual acuity. This presumably occurs because of the diminished opportunity for binocular summation under monovision conditions. To conduct this experiment we designed a new acuity chart (the <b>Donut</b> <b>chart),</b> based on circular targets, which provided a gap resolution task which was not orientation dependent...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} for recording and display of resources for IaaS providers visualizes recorded data of resource usage. Framework supports {{three types of}} visualizations: donut, line and areal charts. <b>Donut</b> <b>chart</b> shows the last value of metrics for all servers of all providers. Line chart shows history of resource usage for one metric and one server. Areal chart shows resource usage of one metric and all servers for specific provider. When user selects a time period, metrics and servers, the data is loaded and small charts are shown. If small chart is clicked, big interactive chart is drawn. Line and areal charts have below main chart drawn another low chart, {{which is used to}} select time period of drawn chart. On mouse move over line chart, time and value is shown for that moment. Framework works in browsers that supports web standards...|$|E
40|$|Crisis Text Line {{supports}} {{people with}} mental health issues through texting. Unfortunately, support {{is limited by the}} number of counselors and the time each counselor has for clients, as well as the cognitive load on counselors from managing multiple conversations simultaneously. We conducted a contextual inquiry with crisis counselors to find contributing problems in their work flow. We believe topic modeling can provide automatic summaries of conversation text to augment note-taking and transcript-reading. Four simple and familiar visualizations were developed to present the model data: 1) a list of conversation topics, 2) a <b>donut</b> <b>chart</b> of topic percentages, 3) a line chart of topic trends, and 4) a scatter plot of specific topic points in the text. Our hypothesis is that these visualizations will help counselors spend more time on clients without overloading the counselors. The visualizations were evaluated through a user study to determine their effectiveness against a control interface. by Ge (Jackie) Chen. Thesis: M.

40|$|The {{bar chart}} {{is one of}} the most {{frequently}} requested graphs at all types of work sites: from banking to pharma-ceuticals. Nevertheless, the SAS/GRAPH Â® GCHART procedure has a reputation for being confusing with the re-sult that many users turn to Microsoft EXCEL for a quick solution to their graphics problems. This tutorial presents the basic features of the GCHART procedure concentrating on the data structures that lend themselves to charting. Besides the VBAR statement with associated options for vertical bar charts, time will be spent on looking at how the PATTERN, AXIS, FORMAT and LEGEND statements can be used to build a good graph. Subgroup and Group charts are also discussed along with horizontal bar <b>charts,</b> pie, <b>donut,</b> and star <b>charts.</b> Even if you have minimal experience with SAS/GRAPH software, you should come away from this presentation knowing how to quickly create a polished bar chart with GCHART. Introduction: Sticking to the Basics Every attempt is being made to keep it simple. Macros, annotate data sets and lengthy discussions about graph-ics statements, devices or catalog entries are not included in the paper. Also, the more complicated GREPLA...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview on existing data quality metrics for structured and unstructured data {{as well as on}} the existing data quality dashboards for measuring the quality of structured and unstructured data. Open research questions for interpreting the data quality are discussed. The metrics percentage of null values, percentage of duplicate values and percentage of non-domain values were selected and implemented as REST based web services. Furthermore, a web application was developed to enable (1) upload of the data file for which data quality shall be assessed from two standard formats JSON and CSV and (2) flexible integration of various data quality metrics. The latter is enabled by using an interface. To illustrate the functionality of this interface, the metric percentage of spelling mistakes provided by the supervisor of the thesis is integrated with the web application. The data quality is indicated as percentage in the range from 0 to 100 as well as encoded with colors for the whole dataset and for each column. <b>Donut</b> <b>chart</b> or pie chart visualizations are implemented for the chosen data quality metrics. The implemented web application and metrics were evaluated with the example datasets for data accumulating in the product life cycle as provided by the supervisor. Finally, the dashboard is compared with existing data quality dashboards and the results are tabulated...|$|E
