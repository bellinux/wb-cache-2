In a real-time scheduling process, the execution of periodic tasks can be deferred {{as long as this}} does not cause other tasks to violate their time constraints. However, aperiodic tasks that usually have urgent missions should complete execution as early as possible. In this paper, it is assumed that aperiodic tasks also have time constraints. Thus, the problem of deciding whether an aperiodic task with an unpredict-able arrival time can be scheduled successfully or not is difficult to solve because delaying periodic tasks may cause them to fail to meet their time constraints. We present a dynamic scheduling technique to solve this prob-lem which makes use of the symmetric property of a schedule. The maxi-mum possible <b>idle</b> <b>slot</b> is always reserved at every scheduling point so that aperiodic tasks can be serviced immediately if the reserved <b>idle</b> <b>slot</b> is big enough to service them.

40|$|Abstract—In radio {{frequency}} identifications (RFIDs), an <b>idle</b> <b>slot</b> can be {{interrupted by the}} reader and takes less time than the other slots. In this case, the widely used binary splitting (BS) protocol is not optimal. M-ary splitting (M> 2) with a carefully selected M outperforms BS, because it can take into account smaller duration of the idle slots. In this paper, we provide optimal value of M (M) for varying slot sizes that yields minimum identification time. The proposed scheme is called optimal splitting (OS). We also revise OS to deal with mobile tags and propose the optimal splitting with arrival tags blocking (OS-ATB) protocol. Extensive simulations show that OS and OS-ATB consistently yield better performance than the other splitting and tree-based schemes. Note to Practitioners — An RFID reader can interrupt the slot in which no tags reply for a predefined time interval, resulting in an short <b>idle</b> <b>slot.</b> In this case, binary splitting {{is not the best}} choice but simple increase of the splitting level can yield much better performance. Since the slot sizes are usually fixed for a given system, the optimum value can be calculated offline without introducing extra computation complexity during the realtime identification.

The analysis considers the worst case scenario in terms of frequency availability in densely populated urban areas. All BSSs are within close proximity, i.e., all wireless stations, APs and WUs, share one single channel and can hear each other, albeit being potential interferers. The spectrum is considered ‘closed’, that is a single 20 -MHz channel entirely dedicated to this Fi-Wi network. When a station wants to contend the channel, the backoff counter is randomly selected within the range (0,CW− 1) and then decremented at each subsequent <b>idle</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E

30|$|A popular MAC {{standard}} {{described by}} IEEE 802.15. 4 for {{wireless sensor networks}} and actuator networks defines two operating modes: non-beacon-enabled mode where the receivers are always awake to receive a frame and beacon-enabled mode which describes super frames where the nodes are only awake during {{a small part of}} a super frame and they sleep quite often. In the second mode, significant traffic results in frequent collisions and packet losses which causes an increase in energy consumption and low throughput. To operate IEEE 802.15. 4 with low duty cycles needs MAC parameter adjustment to attain low energy consumption. The beacon-enabled mode behavior is analyzed in [38] to define the main performance bottlenecks. The adaptation method is referred to as ABE where a coordinator observes the number of <b>idle</b> <b>slots</b> before a transmission starts. However, a node consumes energy to observe <b>idle</b> <b>slots</b> because it needs to be awake. This problem is solved by delegating tracking of <b>idle</b> <b>slots</b> to the coordinator that always needs to stay awake during the active period. ABE is compared with the IEEE 802.15. 4 standard configured with static backoff exponent which specifies the size of the contention window values. Results show that ABE provides optimal throughput without considering the number of nodes. The value of the contention window which optimizes throughput is found by the coordinator in ABE. The adaptation mechanism in ABE which adjusts the optimal contention window values yields high throughputs along with low duty cycles, leading to low energy dissipation.|$|R

As a consequence the resources are often inefficiently used as some of them remain unallocated in the final schedule. To address this issue we propose a technique called job folding that uses virtualization to reduce the number of processors allocated to a parallel job and thus allows to execute it earlier. Our goal is to optimize the resource use. In this paper we propose several heuristics based on job folding and we compare their performance with classical on-line scheduling algorithms as FCFS or backfilling.

30|$|Following the users’ {{transmissions}} in a contention round, each arbitrary {{time slot}} {{has one of}} the following statuses: (a) no transmission (<b>idle</b> <b>slot),</b> (b) only one transmission (singleton slot), (c) more than one transmission (collision slot). To improve the throughout performance of the system, BS exploits SIC to resolve some of the packets received during the collision slots. To this end, the BS needs to store the received signals in the previous slots of a contention round. After the arrival of new time slot, the BS executes a round of SIC where it first resolves the collision-free packets from the stored and current received signals. Then, the BS cancels the corresponding interference of the resolved packets from collision slots. By doing such, some other singleton slots may appear making resolving some other packets possible. This process is iteratively repeated until no more packets can be resolved. At this point, the BS either terminates the contention round if the stopping criteria is met or waits for the next time slot to resolve further packets.|$|E

30|$|Vehicles become {{insensitive}} in {{signal detection}} as CS threshold grows and such insensitivity helps to improve PDR if CS threshold {{is less than}} a crossover point. Recall that a vehicle records whether or not each <b>slot</b> is <b>idle</b> in its monitoring table and selects its transmission slot among all the <b>idle</b> <b>slots</b> recorded in the table. Obviously, the insensitivity increases with CS threshold; thus, the number of <b>idle</b> <b>slots</b> recorded in the table increases with a CS threshold. This implies that a probability that more than two vehicles selects the same transmission slot decreases as a CS threshold rises. In contrast, the insensitivity in signal detection contributes to PDR degradation if CS threshold passes the crossover point. In most wireless communication systems, receivers first detect a signal of a packet, then decode the packet [21]. In the regime whereby CS threshold is too high, receivers fail to detect a large fraction of packets. In other words, the detection failure is a dominant factor that influences PDR in this regime; thus, PDR degrades with CS threshold.|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{the initial}} value of CW {{is set to}} CWmin (the minimum CW). Subsequently, the CW value is doubled when packet {{transmission}} fails. For a node to obtain a Backoff value, it must first determine whether the channel is in use. If the channel is not busy, then the Backoff value decreases by 1 in every time slot and the node transmits the data when the Backoff value reaches zero. However, if the channel is busy, then the Backoff counter freezes. When the channel is in an idle state, it waits for a DCF IFS (DIFS) time period after which the Backoff value begins to decrease again. If the packet transmission continues to fail, then the CW value increases to CWmax (the maximum CW); when the node receives an ACK packet, CW is reset to CWmin. If a node receives an error packet, it must wait for an extended IFS (EIFS) time period. Then, the node determines again whether the channel is in an idle state. If it is, then after a DIFS time, the Backoff value decreases by 1 after each <b>idle</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
