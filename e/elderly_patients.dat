25|$|Citing an {{increased}} risk of stroke, in 2004 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and risperidone, both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to <b>elderly</b> <b>patients</b> with dementia. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a black box warning for increased risk of death in <b>elderly</b> <b>patients.</b> It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. However, a BBC investigation in June 2008 found that this advice was being widely ignored by British doctors.|$|E

25|$|Studies of {{the quality}} of {{preventive}} health care find the opposite results: primary care physicians perform best. An analysis of <b>elderly</b> <b>patients</b> found that patients seeing generalists, as compared to patients seeing specialists, were more likely to receive influenza vaccination.

25|$|Quazepam is more {{tolerable}} for <b>elderly</b> <b>patients</b> {{compared to}} flurazepam {{due to its}} reduced next day impairments. However, another study showed marked next day impairments after repeated administration due to accumulation of quazepam and its long-acting metabolites. Thus the medical literature shows conflicts on quazepam's side effect profile. A further study showed significant balance impairments combined with an unstable posture after administration of quazepam in test subjects.|$|E
25|$|At 24 weeks, {{significant}} improvements were found, including {{accuracy of information}} processing improved, but a decline was seen in those who remained on benzodiazepines. Further improvements were noted at the 52-week followup, indicating ongoing improvements with benzodiazepine abstinence. Younger people on benzodiazepines also experience cognitive deterioration in visual spatial memory, but are not as vulnerable as the elderly to the cognitive effects. Improved reaction times were noted at 52 weeks in <b>elderly</b> <b>patients</b> free from benzodiazepines. This is an important function in the elderly, especially if they drive a car due to the increased risk of road traffic accidents in benzodiazepine users. At the 24-week followup, 80% of people had successfully withdrawn from benzodiazepines. Part of the success was attributed to the placebo method used {{for part of the}} trial which broke the psychological dependence on benzodiazepines when the <b>elderly</b> <b>patients</b> realised they had completed their gradual reduction several weeks previously, and had only been taking placebo tablets. This helped reassure them they could sleep without their pills.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} research, no uniform picture emerged of {{the role}} of relatives in the meeting between an <b>elderly</b> <b>patient</b> and a physician. Knowledge about relatives&#x 2019; experiences of the meeting between an <b>elderly</b> <b>patient</b> and a physician will help healthcare practitioners better understand the role of relatives during the meeting and how practitioners can assist relatives in assuming their supporting role more efficiently. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore experiences of relatives of meeting with the physician in a hospital setting when an <b>elderly</b> <b>patient</b> is discharged from hospital care to home care, in order to identify aspects that may facilitate relatives in taking up their role in a more efficient manner. This descriptive and exploratory study is based on 20 interviews with relatives. The result shows that the physician&#x 0027;s communication style influences the meeting between the relative, the <b>elderly</b> <b>patient,</b> and the physician, and that this style is the result of power and interaction. A trustful relationship during the meeting between the relative and the physician can increase the relative&#x 0027;s feeling of confidence with the healthcare organization and treatment of the <b>elderly</b> <b>patient.</b> The relative has an important supporting role in the care for the elderly family member, both in the hospital and the home setting. It is likely that the relative&#x 0027;s value as a resource, for both the patient and the physician, increases as the relative experiences feelings of confidence in the meeting with the physician. It is therefore of value to increase our knowledge about the conditions and circumstances facilitating and/or hampering the meeting between the relative and the physician. The result stresses the importance of encouraging relatives to participate in the meeting. Physicians need more guidance and training in communication skills, respectful demeanor, and collaboration while meeting the relatives...|$|R
