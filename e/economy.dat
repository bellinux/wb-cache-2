5|$|Although the <b>economy</b> {{was already}} in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The <b>economy</b> shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The <b>economy</b> soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine <b>economy</b> contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} agglomeration <b>economies</b> on firm‐level productivity in Vietnam. By using Vietnamese firm‐level data and the cluster detection method proposed by Mori and Smith (2013), we estimate the agglomeration <b>economies</b> for firm‐level productivity. Specifically, we consider the different effects of agglomeration <b>economies</b> for localization and urbanization, as well as across types of firms; state‐owned, private, and foreign‐owned firms. Furthermore, we decompose the agglomeration <b>economies</b> into the three sources of the effect; inter‐industry transaction relationships, knowledge spillovers, and labor pooling. We find the following results. First, localization <b>economies</b> actually improve firm‐level productivity in Vietnam, with firms in the clustered areas having higher productivities. However, the localization <b>economies</b> do not improve the productivity of the state‐owned firms. Second, urbanization <b>economies</b> improve productivity only for foreign‐owned firms. State‐owned and private firms do not benefit from urbanization <b>economies.</b> From the decomposition of agglomeration <b>economies,</b> we find that agglomeration <b>economies</b> formed through transactions work only for private firms. On the other hand, agglomeration <b>economies</b> formed through knowledge spillovers and labor pooling work for foreign‐owned firms...|$|R

The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's <b>economy</b> not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930.

40|$|Abstract: The {{strategic}} {{theory of}} resource-based view (RBV) put Penrose (1959) in the spotlight. The {{key to understanding}} Penrose’s assertion {{is the concept of}} <b>economies</b> of growth independent of <b>economies</b> of size. According to Penrose, even when <b>economies</b> of size are not working, <b>economies</b> of growth exist regardless of size. Further, the <b>economies</b> of growth are temporary in nature and disappear once expansion is completed. In which managerial services are the <b>economies</b> of growth embodied? This paper hypothesizes that the <b>economies</b> of growth occur where there are unused start-up expert managerial services. Regardless of size, where these services exist, paving the company’s way by step-by-step growth should produce profits...|$|R
