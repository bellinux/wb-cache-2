Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours.

500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi {{received}} a 64 out of 100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") on Metacritic, a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a [...] "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" [...] and [...] "relative comeback" [...] for Carey, {{although it is}} not as [...] "catchy" [...] as he thought it should have been. Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album: that Carey's voice seemed [...] "damaged" [...] in comparison to her [...] "glory years" [...] in the 1990s. He commented that in the belted songs such as [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Knew", Carey's voice sounded [...] "as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet". Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals, writing that [...] "while her voice has lost some of the power through the years, Mimi deftly showcases her still-considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production." [...] Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey's best album since Butterfly (1997). Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey's voice [...] "very impressive". He concluded: [...] "While Emancipation may not send Carey's stock or star back up to where it once was and where that voice deserves to be, at least she's not plummeting – she's merely levelled off." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song [...] "showcases Carey's undeniable vocal strengths". Reviewing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Sinclair concluded, [...] "It's so moving that we'll resist the temptation to be crass and interpret the song as a plea <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> record sales. Help from above is always welcome, but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{twelfth century}} {{is marked by}} the growth of affective piety, or a form of spirituality that {{differed}} {{from that of the}} previous centuries by placing much greater emphasis on self-examination, the inner emotions, and the cultivation of an interior life. [...] This form of piety was typically anchored in devotion to Christ in his human form, with special attention to the events of the Passion. [...] The movement was led first by the Cistercians Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153) and Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1167); by the thirteenth century the movement came to be closely identified with Franciscan religiosity, especially as shaped by Francis of Assisi (d. 1226) and Bonaventure (d. 1274). [...] The flamboyant piety of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries developed from these roots. [...] Although {{it would be a mistake}} to view late medieval piety as homogeneous, its dominant expressions were notable <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> degrees of emotionalism and a preoccupation with the tortured body of Christ and the grief of the Virgin Mary.|$|E

Following {{a sweep of}} legislative changes in almost {{every state in the}} early nineteenth century all non-marital children were legitimated as to their mothers.

2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, but {{is widely regarded}} as a landmark film in Indian cinema history. It is credited with the formation of a new trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The Hindu described Kanchana Sita {{as one of the most}} poetic films in Malayalam. Scholar V. Rajakrishnan noted that Aravindan had not fully considered the implications of locating Rama's story in an Adivasi community. Rajakrishnan pointed out that the rigid economy of expression and the subdued acting styles, which appear to render all dialogue artificial, reduce the element of human drama that is so prominent in Sreekantan Nair's play. Poet and scholar Ayyappa Panicker views Sita's absence as typical of Aravindan's style, in which there is a conscious, meticulous effort [...] "not to communicate in order to communicate". Panicker described Aravindan's expressive style using his own concept of antarasannivesa, or the poetics of interiorisation. [...] "Sita is not a woman, or an individual, but an eternal concept in the film", Panicker said in an interview. The Hindu critic Sashi Kumar stated, [...] "In the film, Aravindan synthesises into a consummate whole his marginality principle and his anthropomorphic contemplation of nature." [...] Vidyarthy Chatterjee of The Economic Times said, [...] "Visually stunning in many passages and using sound in such a manner as to make <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> aesthetic pleasure, Kanchana Sita is a milestone that has unfortunately been bypassed by many who would have done better to focus on its innovative elements". Yves Thoraval said, [...] "Kanchana Sita is a visually dazzling film illustrating this long mythological episode potentially rich in dialogue but of which G. Aravindan has chosen to make a non realist, virtually silent and contemplative film by calling up a tribal population to portray the mythological characters".|$|E
