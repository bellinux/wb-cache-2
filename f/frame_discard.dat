40|$|Video {{delivery}} from {{a server}} to a client across a network {{is an important}} component of many multimedia applications. While delivering a video stream across a resource constrained network, loss of frames may be unavoidable. Under such circumstances, it is desirable to find a server transmission schedule that can efficiently utilize the network resources while maximizing the perceived quality-of-service (QoS) at the client. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce the notion of selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard</b> at the server and formulate the optimal selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard</b> problem using a QoS-based cost function. Given network bandwidth and client buffer constraints, we develop an algorithm to find the minimum number of frames that must be discarded in order to meet these constraints. The correctness of the algorithm is also formally established. We present a dynamic programming based algorithm for solving the problem of optimal selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard.</b> Since the computational complexity of the optimal algorithm is prohibitively high in general, we also develop several efficient heuristic algorithms for selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard.</b> These algorithms are evaluated using JPEG and MPEG video traces...|$|E

Both algorithms consist in pre-emptively discarding frames at the sender {{to achieve the}} lowest impact possible on quality whenever congestion occurs. The video is streamed using the DCCP protocol, which has congestion control mechanism built in, {{as described in the}} paper. The performance of the algorithms was obtained using computer simulation. The results obtained show that both algorithms achieve higher PSNR and in some cases lower end-to-end delay when compared with no selective discard. It is also observed that the results obtained by the algorithms are similar for both low and high movement video content...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A mobile {{terminal}} equipped with multiple interfaces can achieve {{a much higher}} bandwidth by aggregating the bandwidth offered by the individual networks. This helps support demanding applications like interactive video. Often, in spite of bandwidth aggregation, the available bandwidth may be too small to avoid frame loss altogether. Under these circumstances, {{it may be necessary}} to selectively discard frames to minimize the effect of their loss on the overall video quality. In this paper, we consider different <b>frame</b> <b>discard</b> algorithms and study their performance in the presence of multiple interfaces. We show through trace driven simulations that attempting to transmit every frame results in severe performance degradation. In particular we show that our proposed algorithm MC-Drop outperforms other algorithms in terms of suitably defined metrics that capture overall video quality. I...|$|E

40|$|Many {{multimedia}} applications require {{transmission of}} streaming video from a server to a client across an internetwork.

Multimedia applications require transmission of streaming video from a server to a client across an internetwork. In many cases loss may be unavoidable due to congestion or heterogeneous nature of the network. In this paper considered online policies for selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard</b> and analyse their performance by means of competitive analysis. Our online algorithm used to prove the upper bound is non pre-emptive no packet admitted to the buffer. Algorithm is, {{in case of an}} overflow, to prefer keeping packets from frames for which it has already delivered many packets, and dropping packets from frames with fewer packets already delivered. This algorithm essentially tries on effort already invested in delivering earlier packets of a frame.

40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of Internet brings {{to focus the}} need to control such large networks. It is desirable to find simple local rules and strategies that can produce coherent and purposeful global behavior. The need for such mechanisms arises {{in a variety of}} settings. In quality-of-service based routing, paths for flows are selected basedupon the knowledge of resource availability at network nodes and the QoS requirements of flows. The best-path routing schemes gather global network state information and always select the best path for an incoming flow based on this global view. On the other hand, the proportional routing schemes proportion incoming flows among multiple candidate paths. We show that near-optimal proportions can be obtained using only locally collected information and a few good candidate paths can be selected using infrequently exchanged global information. We demonstrate that proportional routing schemes achieve higher throughput with lower overhead than best-path routing schemes. Video delivery for full quality playback requires a certain amount of network bandwidth and client buffer. But when these resources are limited, a naive video transmission may cause packet drops at the network and frame drops at the client, resulting in wastage of resources. To avoid this, a server may need to preemptively discard frames locally taking advantage of application-specific information. We first formulate the optimal selective <b>frame</b> <b>discard</b> problem and then present several efficient heuristic algorithms. We also develop adaptive selective layer discard algorithms for providing smoother quality playback of a layered video. Distributed dynamic channel assignment algorithms run at each base station in a wireless cellular network attempt to reduce the network-wide call blocking and call dropping probabilities while making assignment decisions based on neighborhood information only. They may also reassign channels being used by calls in progress to make room for another call. We propose two channel selection strategies based on localpacking for compact packing of channels. We also present a reassignment based call admission control scheme that dynamically adjusts the number of guard channels reserved for handoffs based on reassignment frequency in the neighborhood...|$|E

But the EDCA does not fulfill the very stringent QoS requirements of hard real-time applications like interactive multi-media, video-conferencing. Keeping this in mind, in this research article, we have enhanced the quality of service feature of EDCA by adding transmission opportunity (TXOP) based frame-concatenation with block-acknowledgement scheme. Together with these enhancements, we have proposed an analytical model for the performance analysis of EDCA using three-dimensional Markov chain. The contemporary models of EDCA support only a small subset of features. Our analytical model covers all salient features of EDCA like multiple numbers of simultaneously active access categories (ACs) per station, internal collision handling, back-off counter freezing, post-back-off and <b>frame</b> <b>discarding.</b> Also, the enhanced frame-concatenation with block-acknowledgement feature is included. The proposed model incorporates different parameters for each AC for service differentiation.

The comparison affirms the superior performance of our proposed model. Analytical and simulation results match pretty well and validate our model...|$|R

"Data Centre virtualisation" [...] articulates {{the desire}} to {{flexibly}} and efficiently harness available compute resources {{in a way that}} may rapidly be modified to respond to varying application demands, without the need to dedicate physical resources to a specific application. One aspect of this is server virtualisation. The other is connectivity virtualisation, because a physically distributed set of server resources must be attached to a single IP subnet, and modifiable in an operationally simple and robust way. SPBM delivers this; because of its client-server model, it offers a perfect emulation of a transparent Ethernet LAN segment, which is the IP subnet seen at layer 3. A key component of how it does this is implementing VLANs with scoped multicast trees, which means no egress discard of broadcast/unknown traffic, a feature common to approaches that use a small number of shared trees, hence the network does not simply degrade with size as the percentage of <b>frames</b> <b>discarded</b> goes up. It also supports [...] "single touch" [...] provisioning, so that configuration is simple and robust; the port of a virtual server must simply be bound locally to the SPBM I-SID identifying the LAN segment, after which IS-IS for SPB floods this binding, and all nodes that need to install forwarding state to implement the LAN segment do so automatically.|$|R
