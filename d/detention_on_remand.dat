40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether the prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents <b>on</b> court ordered <b>remand</b> in South Australia has changed since 1989. To compare the prevalence of mental health problems reported among adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> in 1989 and 2008 / 09 with the prevalence among adolescents in the general community. Method: Mental health problems were identified using the Youth Self-Report (YSR), which was completed by 11 - 17 year olds <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> in South Australia in 1989 (n= 100) and in 2008 / 09 (n= 197), and 13 - 17 year olds (n= 1, 283) in the national survey of mental health problems among Australian adolescents conducted in 1998. Results: Although adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> reported somewhat fewer mental health problems in 2008 / 09 than were reported in 1989, the prevalence of problems in both groups of adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that reported for adolescents in the general community. Conclusion: Adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> have a much higher prevalence of mental health problems than other adolescents in the community, with little change evident over the past 20 years. Implications: To reduce the high levels of mental health problems experienced by adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand,</b> interventions need to provide effective management and treatment both during the time adolescents are <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> and after they return to the general community.

40|$|Punishment with {{imprisonment}} and {{the security}} measureof <b>detention</b> <b>on</b> <b>remand,</b> {{are among the most}} severe sanctions and convictions provided by the albanian criminal legislation. The unjust serving of such measures or punishments implies serious psychological and economic consequences for both the convicted person and his/her family members. Similar to the infringement of any right and freedom, the unjust infringement of the right to liberty, induces the obligation to return the person in the previous state and to provide compensation for related consequences. Besides the right to effective remedy, the international human rights acts provide, specifically, for the right to compensation of the person in cases of an unlawful arrest or detention, {{as well as in the}} case of serving an unjust punishment as a result of the miscarriage of justice. In both hereof mentioned cases, these acts acknowledge the right to compensation for unjust imprisonment, while leaving it to the member states to establish a special mechanism under the domestic legislation which would enable actual fulfillment of such right for the citizens of the said country. This paper is an attempt to present an overview of the Albanian legislation regarding the mechanism established toward the effective implementation of the right to compensation, in the case of decisions of the respective state institutions causing the unlawful or unjust imprisonment, from the point of view of respective international obligations...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} nature and {{prevalence}} of mental health problems, prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour, and health-related {{quality of life of}} 13 – 17 -year-olds <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> with that of 13 – 17 -year-olds in the general community. Method: Self reported questionnaires completed by 13 – 17 -year-olds who were remanded in South Australia in 2008 / 9 (N = 159), 13 – 17 -year-olds who participated in the Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being in Australia (N = 1283), and 13 – 17 -year-olds who participated in the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (N = 1100). Mental health problems were identified using the Youth Self-Report and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire. Results: A total of 50. 0 % (95 % CI, 42. 3 – 58. 3) of adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> versus 18. 9 % of adolescents in the community scored above the recommended cut-off score on the Youth Self-Report. Among Indigenous adolescents, 55. 8 % (95 % CI, 41. 3 – 69. 5) <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> versus 32. 1 % in the community scored above the recommended cut-off score on the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Among those <b>on</b> <b>remand,</b> 19. 1 % (95 % CI, 13. 2 – 26. 2) reported making a suicide attempt during the previous 12 months compared to 4. 3 % in the community. Health-related quality of life was significantly worse among adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> than adolescents in the community. These differences remained after adjusting for differences in the demographic characteristics of the two groups of adolescents. Conclusions: Compared with adolescents in the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> experience a wide range of problems, including poorer mental and physical health, a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour, greater family adversity, and poorer school attendance. This broad range of problems needs to be effectively addressed to enable adolescents <b>on</b> <b>remand</b> to become active and productive members of their communities. Michael G.
