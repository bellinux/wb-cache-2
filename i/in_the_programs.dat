Lynch is the Terrier head coach with the most wins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> history (283). Part of that wins total came during a 6-year span from 1950 to 1956, where Lynch guided the Terriers to five consecutive winning seasons going 121–43.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} selected parametres of reproduction <b>in</b> sows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first litter and piglets loss from birth to weaning after repopulation in a production sow herd. Observed parametres were evaluated in two commercial programs. An experimental group consisted of 80 gilts (40 in commercial program A and 40 in commercial programm B). Gained values of the total number of piglets per litter were 16. 23 ± 2. 26 from gilts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A and 15. 63 ± 2. 13 from gilts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B. Evaluation of live-born piglets per litter showed numbers of 14. 74 ± 2. 09 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A and 14. 50 ± 2. 10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B. Numbers of stillborn piglets per litter were 1. 48 ± 1. 30 for gilts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A against 1. 13 ± 1. 42 for gilts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B and numbers of reared piglets per litter were 13. 20 ± 1. 52 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A against 13. 68 ± 2. 00 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B. Statistical evaluation confirmed no significant differences between <b>the</b> two commertial <b>programs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> selected reproductive parametres. Piglet losses from birth to weaning were also evaluated. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A 1. 55 ± 1. 48 piglets were lost per a gilt against 0. 83 ± 1. 39 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B. <b>The</b> percentage of piglet loss was 9. 55 ± 9. 04 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> A and 5. 28 ± 8. 67 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> B. <b>The</b> statisticaly significant difference (P ≤ 0. 05) was proved between <b>the</b> two commercial <b>programs.</b> <b>The</b> values found by <b>the</b> experiment <b>in</b> both <b>programs</b> can be considered very competitive therefore recovery by the means of repopulation and induction of SPF herds can be recommended...|$|R

500|$|One such problem set as a {{task for}} a genetic program was {{to design a}} {{crossover}} filter for woofer and tweeter loudspeakers. The output design was identical in topology to a design found in a patent of Zobel's for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, {{not only because of}} the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were [...] "decomposed" [...] as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> parameters. Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a hi-fi system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.|$|E

He said that people in the business often shorthanded [...] "wholesome, pretty girls" [...] as [...] "broads", and [...] "attractive" [...] as [...] "bosoms". Another memo summarizing the same meeting, written by Screen Gems executive William Dozier, read as follows: [...] "There is not enough sex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs.</b> Neither lead has gotten involved even for a single episode with the normal wants of a young man, namely to get involved with a girl or even to kiss her." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocational programs, {{known as}} Career and College Tech Prep classes, are {{available}} at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact, which includes the Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Stow-Munroe Falls, Tallmadge, and Woodridge school districts. [...] The compact, established in 1969, combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows students to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> that are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building. [...] There are 25 programs, six of which are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits. [...] The remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed to give students training and work experience. [...] College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include programs in athletic healthcare and fitness, manufacturing and engineering, landscape horticulture, and teaching. [...] Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business-related programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, construction and remodeling, cosmetology, electronics, health technology, marketing, and out-of-school internships. [...] Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation, culinary arts, theater arts, automotive repair and technology, banking and finance, and early childhood educational aide training. [...] Each program also has co-curricular component, meaning they have both in-class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student's overall grade.

2500|$|Because Mexico was {{dominated}} by one political party for 71 years, women's roles as mothers was politicized, marginalizing the political involvement of feminism to a great degree before 2000. This narrow view of women often put feminist goals at odds with activities that they also supported. For example, both state run and national programs, likeDIF, offer welfare assistance and food supplements to low income women. To receive the benefits, the government requires women to take classes in domestic skills. Programs target skill programs that tie women to domesticity or are low-skill without evaluation as to whether those programs are appropriate or needed in the local marketplace. The systemic [...] "blindness" [...] {{with regard to the}} official recognition of women's roles allows women no input <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> designed to help them, nor recognition of the achievements they have made from organizing and agitating for change.|$|E
2500|$|Ceaușescu visited China, North Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic and North Vietnam in 1971. He {{took great}} {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} total national transformation as embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> of North Korea's Juche and China's Cultural Revolution. He was also inspired by the personality cults of North Korea's Kim Il-sung and China's Mao Zedong. Journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceaușescu admired both Mao and Kim as leaders who not only totally dominated their nations, but had also used totalitarian methods coupled with generous shots of ultra-nationalism mixed in with communism in order to transform both China and North Korea into major world powers. Furthermore, that Kim and even more so Mao had broken free of Soviet control were additional sources of admiration for Ceaușescu. According to Behr, Elena Ceaușescu allegedly bonded with Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. The British journalist wrote that the possibility that what Ceaușescu had seen in both China and North Korea were [...] "vast Potemkin villages for the hoodwinking of gullible foreign guests" [...] was something that never seemed to have crossed his mind. Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea's system. North Korean books on Juche were translated into Romanian and widely distributed inside the country.|$|E
