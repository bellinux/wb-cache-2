40|$|The <b>king</b> <b>weakfish</b> (pescada-gó in Portuguese - Macrodon ancylodon (Sciaenidae), a {{demersal}} (bottom-feeding) species {{found in}} South America Atlantic coastal waters from the Gulf of Paria in Venezuela to Baia Blanca in Argentina, is an economically important species {{because of its}} abundance and wide acceptance by consumers. Because of its wide distribution this fish {{may be subject to}} geographic isolation and this may have resulted in distinct populations along its coastal range. Considering that this species represents an important economic resource, confirmation of whether M. ancylodon is a single species or there are different genetic stocks spread over its wide distribution would be an important contribution to conservation policies and population management of the <b>king</b> <b>weakfish.</b> To investigate differences between <b>king</b> <b>weakfish</b> populations we used the cytochrome b and 16 S rRNA genes to characterize M. ancylodon specimens caught throughout its South American range from Venezuela to Argentina. Our results clearly distinguished two genetically different groups which show nucleotide divergence and genetic structuring patterns that strongly suggest they may be different species, disagreeing with the widely accepted traditional taxonomy that accepts only one species of Macrodon in the western Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|The American sciaenid genus Macrodon {{presently}} {{consists of}} only two species, the Atlantic Macrodon ancylodon (Bloch & Schneider, 1801), and the Pacific Macrodon mordax (Gilbert & Starks, 1904). The two species are distinguished mainly {{by the number of}} pored scales on the lateral line (66 – 78 in M. ancylodon vs. 45 – 55 in M. mordax). The present study revalidates a third species, the second from the Atlantic, Macrodon atricauda (Günther, 1880), which is genetically, morphologically, and geographically distinct from M. ancylodon, occurring between the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo and northern Argentina. It has significant economic importance in the area and thus considerations about its conservation are also presented.

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{have a great}} socioeconomic {{importance in}} Brazil. Different regional characteristics along the coast, mostly related to landing sites, equipment used, and targeted species, renders its assessment and monitoring difficult. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a list of species of bony fishes (Teleostei) caught by artisanal fisheries along the S&# 227;o Paulo coast, southeastern Brazil and to provide comments on the relative abundance and conservation status of those species. A total of 315 fishing fleet landings were surveyed, and 106 species distributed among 38 families were recorded. Sciaenidae and Carangidae were the most frequent families in species number. The southern <b>king</b> <b>weakfish,</b> Macrodon atricauda, was the most abundant species, representing 28. 03 % of the total number of specimens caught. Eleven of the most abundant species are classified as Overexploited in the country or as Near Threatened in the state of S&# 227;o Paulo. These findings reinforce the relevance of assessing and managing artisanal fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on {{the sexual}} maturity, {{spawning}} and fecundity of <b>king</b> <b>weakfish,</b> Macrodon ancylodon, off the southern coast of Brazil (lat. 29 º to 32 ºS) were carried out from September, 1976, to August, 1977. The sex ratio varied monthly, with slight predominance of males (51. 14 %) over females (48. 86 %). The mean size at first maturity was estimated as 27. 4 cm TL for females and 21. 5 cm TL for males. The macroscopic examination of gonads {{and analysis of the}} gonadal index indicated that December and February were the most intensive spawning months. Fish weight proved to be the best predictor data of fecundity: F = 17056. 2500 + 425. 3712 Wt (r² = 0. 6434), were F is the total number of eggs in both ovaries. The number of eggs of 199 females varied from 59, 850 for 33. 4 cm TL fish to over 358, 450 for 37. 2 cm TL; the mean fecundity verified was 165, 273 eggs per female. Frequency distributions of egg diameter in the ovaries were polymodal, suggesting fractional spawning during the reproduction season...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{register}} the ecological knowledge of fishermen from the municipality of São João de Pirabas, Pará, Brazil, regarding the occurrence of sea turtles on the Pará state coast, as well as measure their incidental capture when fishing; to do this, 50 semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} local fishermen. Fishing was practiced mostly by adult men, who used 7 fishing arts (gillnetting, hook and line, longline, fish corrals, net of tide canals, casting net, and basket trap), mainly aimed at catching king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), serra Spanish mackerel (S. brasiliensis), <b>king</b> <b>weakfish</b> (Macrodon ancylodon), weakfish (Cynoscion spp.), hake (Cynoscion spp.), catfish (Bagre bagre), and mullet (Mugil spp.). Fishermen observed in the region 5 turtle species, with a more frequent occurrence of Chelonia mydas (100 %), Dermochelys coriacea (66 %), and Eretmochelys imbricata (46 %); the less frequent species are Caretta caretta (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (8 %). The spawning areas of the 3 most common species demonstrate the significance of the Pará state coast for their conservation. Incidental capture was reported by 76 % of fishermen, mainly occurring in net, longlines, and fish corrals. Usually, captured animals were released, although there is consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs by fishermen...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{species of}} the family Sciaenidae have been {{reported}} inhabiting bottom waters of the Río de la Plata estuary. Of these juvenile stripped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa), <b>king</b> <b>weakfish</b> (Macrodon ancylodon), whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) and banded ground drum (Paralonchurus brasiliensis) {{are by far the}} most abundant. These species are also important prey of several top-predator species among large fishes, seabirds and mammals. In this study we provide new information regarding otolith morphology and body size relationships of juvenile sciaenid fish. The sagittae morphology of juvenile sciaenids showed strong changes {{in the course of their}} development (e. g. in overall shape and development of concrescences on the outer surface). Analysing the morphometric relationships, we concluded that otolith length and otolith mass are good indicators of fish standard length and fish weight in all species. If otolith length or mass is used to estimate fish length, the regression explained more than 97 % of the variation in all species. All equations relating fish standard length and fish weight for juvenile stages of the species studied explained a very large proportion of the variance in the data. These data will help researchers studying food habits of top predators to determine size and weight of usually juvenile fish-prey from length, broad and/or weight of recovered otoliths...|$|E
40|$|The {{coast of}} Pará State extends for 562 km and it counts on 123 artisan-fishing communities, {{distributed}} along 17 coastal municipal districts. In {{this area of}} the State, it highlights the presence of growth of mangroves, streams, rivers and estuaries. All those factors that favor the fishing productivity hinder the systematic control of the landings a lot and with consequence in obtaining fishing production statistics. This work objective is to present the statistics of fishing production for species in landing volume, in the estuarine and marine areas of Pará Estate and to analyze the fishing police for the systems of industrial and artisan production in the period from 1997 to 2003. To esteem the fishing productions of the estuarine and marine areas in Pará State. There was monthly control on the boat in activity for type of fishing gear used and accomplished samples of the landings of each one of those combinations of boat fishing gear. In the studied area, the municipal districts that concentrate the largest landings are Belém, Bragança and Vigia. The tuna and billfish captures started having some importance from 2000 in Belém City and from 2002 in Belém city and municipal district of Curuçá. The species or groups of more important species in capture volume are yellow weakfish, Thomas sea catfish, Spanish mackerel, sharks, Caribbean red snapper, <b>king</b> <b>weakfish,</b> crab, marine catfish and shrimp and, in economic, value lobsters, shrimp and Caribbean red snapper...|$|E
40|$|A new {{and more}} {{comprehensive}} estimation method for stock-production models is proposed, to provide more reliable stock assessment when data availability is limited. Using difference equations to implement a non-equilibrium production model, the new approach (named POEEM, for Process and Observation Errors Estimation Method) incorporates uncertainties due to both process and observation errors, employing a non-linear model fitting approach. The method has been evaluated using both simulated and real data sets, and {{has been applied to}} data from some Brazilian fish stocks. The weighting ratio between process and observation errors {{has proved to be a}} crucial factor in determining the model results, and a fully satisfactory method for selecting this ratio is still required. Sensitivity analyses conducted with the simulated data have been used to study the behaviour of the method for a range of exploitation and noise levels. Data series with low and medium levels of noise yielded consistent results irrespective of the level of exploitation, whereas very noisy data series did not provide reliable results. For comparison, data from a previously analysed stock was also tested with POEEM and resulted in peculiar results for the stock status and management advice. Data from four demersal species caught o® southeastern Brazilian coast were also analysed employing POEEM, and more conventional methods. For all of them further analyses on mapping some parameters sensitivity must be conducted in order to increased the reliability of the results. Two species have the POEEM estimated assessment trend corroborated by independent biological studies. <b>King</b> <b>weakfish</b> is apparently on the verge of a collapse, with very low levels of production and biomass. Jamaican weakfish is around its maximum sustainable yield and the exploitation level on this stock should not be intensified. For the other two species, high levels of uncertainty were responsible for contradictory outcomes. For whitemouth croaker, the balance between process and observation error could not be consistently achieved, because of high amount of observation noises. For grey triggerfish, the assessment revealed a collapsed stock, but previous biological studies do not corroborate this scenario. Discarding onboard and fleet behaviour appear to be confusing the analysis of this data series. In general, the new method seems to be capable of giving useful results, consistent with biological studies, when a limited amount of data is available. However, further work is needed to find a satisfactory method for fixing the weighting ratio. In order to improve the Brazilian stock assessments, both fishery and biological data must be continuously collected to maintain and update the results, and e®ort data needs to be collected for other fleets, and incorporated in the analysis.
