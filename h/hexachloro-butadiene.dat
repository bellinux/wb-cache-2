The nujol mull analyses {{were carried out}} on a Unicam SP Ioo spectrometer using the silica content of the rock as an internal standard. The <b>hexachloro-butadiene</b> mull analyses were done by a twin-path Unicam SP 2 oo spectrometer, using <b>hexachloro-butadiene</b> asthe internal standard. The broader and more pronounced V 1 vibrational mode (345 o cm- 0 is ratioed to a standard of known composition. Comparisons are also made between absorption due to free water (V 1 = 3450 cm- 0 and combined water (V 3 = 3680 cm- 0 in aplites, biotite granite, and chlorite schists. INFRA-RED investigations into the structure of water, ice, and silica gel systems are numerous (Benesi and Jones, 1959; Davis and Litovitz, 1965; Sheppard, 1959; Ock-man and Sutherland, 1958). Work on silicate structures and the relation of hydroxyl groups within silicates is also extensive (Lyon, 1967; Stubican and Roy, 1961; Vedder, 1964). Quantitative determinations are limited to different mineral groups, but diffi-culties occur in relating specific absorption peaks to their correct ype of structural bonding. Although the problem of using whole rock powders eem overwhelming, th...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to collect new data on the occurrence and levels of priority and emerging organic compounds in freshwater fishes sampled in the Rhone River. The 34 studied contaminants included alkylphenols (AP), bisphenol A (BPA), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDE), perfluorinated compounds (PFC), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCD), hexachloro-benzene (HCB) and <b>hexachloro-butadiene</b> (HCBD). About 50 fish samples (individual specimens or pooled fishes) were collected from 3 sites located upstream and downstream of the Lyon metropolitan area in the Rhone River (France). Four species were caught at each site, namely: the barbel (Barbus barbus), the common bream (Abramis brama), the white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) and the chub (Squalius cephalus). Some contaminants were quantified in all the 32 fish samples analysed: 4 -nonylphenol, α...|$|E

Some contaminants were quantified in all the 32 fish samples analysed: 4 -nonylphenol, Α-HBCD, the 6 PBDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid. And 23 of the 32 samples had concentration of PFOS above the Environmental Quality Standards (up to 6 times higher the EQS); and all the 32 samples had concentrations of PBDE above the EQS (up to 4000 times higher, with the sum of 6 PBDE varying from 4. 5 to 182 ng/g dw). Clearly, the interest to consider PFOS and HBCD as new priority substances is confirmed. In contrast, the pertinence of a priority status for HCBD, which was never quantified in our study, might have to be reconsidered in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{proximal}} tubule of {{the kidney}} is {{a target for}} a wide variety of chemical agents, both inorganic and organic. An in vitro model to investigate the site-specific toxicity of organic nephrotoxins was developed and validated using biochemical, functional, and histological parameters. The in vitro toxicity of cephaloridine, gentamicin, <b>hexachloro-butadiene</b> and S-(1, 2 -dichlorovinyl) -L-cysteine (DCVC) was investigated and the histopathological lesions induced in vitro were compared to those observed in vivo. All four organic nephrotoxins induced a proximal tubular lesion similar to that observed in vivo. DCVC was chosen for additional study. After determining the progression of cellular events resulting from DCVC exposure, the transport, metabolism and localization of DCVC was investigated. DCVC was found to be transported into the proximal tubule via an amino acid system rather than the postulated organic anion system. Aminooxyacetic acid (an inhibitor of β-lyase activity) partially inhibited the covalent binding and toxicity of DCVC indicating that metabolism of DCVC by β-lyase to a reactive thiol is partially responsible for the toxicity. A second enzyme system (L-amino acid oxidase) may play a role in the resulting nephrotoxicity. DCVC is localized to the proximal tubule and mitochondria appear to be the subcellular targets. The site-specific S₃ lesion produced by DCVC may be attributed to innate susceptibility of the S₃ region. The chemical form of a toxin may affect the transport and metabolism of that compound. The N-acetylated derivative of DCVC is an anion and was shown to be transported by the organic anion system. Probenecid, an inhibitor of organic anion transport, almost completely inhibited the toxicity of N-acetyl-DCVC. N-acetyl-DCVC produced a lesion similar to that produced by DCVC. N-acetyl-DCVC is not metabolized by β-lyase and thus must be deacetylated to DCVC prior to being metabolized and producing toxicity. The optical isomer of DCVC, D-DCVC, proved to be less toxic yet exhibited the same selectivity of injury as DCVC. This research demonstrates that an in vitro model which reflects the in vivo toxicity of a compound can be utilized to study the mechanisms (transpoart, metabolism and localization) of selective injury...|$|E
