In 1995, despite {{a lack of}} support for a name change, the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> private school), adopted the name The University of West Alabama. Ed Roach (1998–2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA {{as one of the first}} wireless institutions in the region. Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from University employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell.|$|E

Swift said, [...] "I'd always {{go in there and}} play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> record.

500|$|The wagtail is very [...] "chatty" [...] and has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. John Gould reported that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child's rattle or [...] "small cog-wheels of a steam mill". In his book What Bird is That? (1935), Neville Cayley writes that it has [...] "a pleasant call resembling sweet pretty little creature, frequently uttered during the day or night, especially on moonlight nights".|$|E

500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] {{because he liked}} [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] {{because it was a}} title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|Billboards Jason Lipshutz {{called it}} an [...] "immediately affecting" [...] 2013 song and favoured {{the use of the}} word [...] "miscellaneous" [...] on its lyrics. Robbie Daw from the music website Idolator was in sync with the {{aforementioned}} comments, calling it a [...] "synthy, handclappy, glorious pop gem that comes just in time for the summer". Carl Smith of Sugarscape.com deemed [...] "Flatline" [...] "a bit amazing" [...] and believed that the artists' harmonies could rival the group Little Mix, while noting that the song did not follow any current musical trend. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse opined that the song had [...] "revitalized the very essence" [...] of the Sugababes, named it one of the best of 2013 and commented that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> newly recorded version of One Touch. Much like previous critics, Michelle Kambasha of DIY highlighted the singers' harmonies and noted that Hynes had [...] "inject his solid-gold formula" [...] to the song's production.|$|E

[...] "Girl" [...] was recorded by Jim Caruana at Sony Music Studios in New York City in 2004. The song was mixed by Dave [...] "Hard Drive" [...] Pensado and mastered by Tom Coyne. [...] "Girl" [...] samples the song [...] "Ocean of Thoughts and Dreams", written by Don Davis and Eddie Robinson and performed by The Dramatics. According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Girl" [...] was composed using common time in the key of C minor with a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. The vocal elements span from the low note of E3 to the high note of C5. [...] "Girl" [...] was noted for containing elements of soul music in its composition. Eric Henderson from the website Slant Magazine described the song as Zhané-esque. Dimitri Ehrlich of Vibe magazine felt that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Motown classic on steroids".|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci {{observed}} that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern {{described it as a}} [...] "pensive, slow-strutting contemplation". Alex Rees, writing for the Cosmopolitans felt that Beyoncé's [...] "superpower" [...] in the song was her voice and deemed it a [...] "very empowering" [...] number. Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "Frank Ocean cedes superhuman soul duties to Queen Bey". Latifah Muhammad from the BET called the ballad a [...] "dilapidated union so formidable its deemed a 'Superpower,'" [...] calling it [...] "another shining moment for Bey". Jody Rosen writing for New York was more critical towards the track, saying that although there was [...] "nice singing", it appeared [...] " [...] bit wan". In another review, however, he called it [...] "incandescent". Ryan B. Patrick in a review for Exclaim! was negative towards [...] "Superpower", opining that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> leftover track from Channel Orange with [...] "Beyoncé not quite owning it". In 2013, the song was included at number 228 on the annual Pazz & Jop poll compiled by The Village Voice.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E
500|$|As for her name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki [...] "looks like a shinigami", {{he wanted}} her name to sound like {{something}} a shinigami would have as a name. When deciding upon her family name he considered using [...] because <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> name a shinigami would have, and then decided to use [...] He adds that he once heard something that sounded like [...] "Kuchiki Rukia" [...] on Japanese television, and liked it enough {{to use it as}} a name. Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E

500|$|... "Wind It Up" [...] {{received}} generally negative reviews {{by contemporary}} pop music critics. Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak found the bassline [...] "rubbery" [...] and criticized the song for lacking a melody {{as well as}} its reference to Stefani's own clothing line. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that The Neptunes had forced the sampling [...] "into one of their typical minimalist tracks, over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material-minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape". Bill Lamb of About.com rated the song three and a half stars, giving it [...] "high marks for entertainment value", but commented that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> retread of [...] "Rich Girl" [...] from Stefani's debut album Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine was mixed on the track, writing that [...] "it's preventing something far less interesting from getting played." [...] John Murphy from musicOMH panned the track as [...] "just horrible, and possibly the worst start to an album this year". Spence D. from IGN characterized the song as [...] "a bugged out Sound Of Music bhangra blitz that sounds like part M.I.A. and part Julie Andrews".|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, Smith {{considered}} the role ideal for Wendy Richard, {{with whom she}} had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, The Newcomers; [...] Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use [...] "stars"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom Are You Being Served? At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not [...] "duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects." [...] In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that [...] "powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened" [...] had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, [...] "If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life." [...] Richard thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> challenging role.|$|E
500|$|Maggie's {{first word}} was {{provided}} by the Academy Award-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who would also voice herself in the season four finale, [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress. Although it was only one word, the voice came out [...] "too sexy" [...] and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby. Several sources, including John Ortved's The Simpsons history article [...] "Simpsons Family Values" [...] in Vanity Fair, have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said [...] "fuck you" [...] to series creator Matt Groening and stormed out of the studio. Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and was also quoted by the New York Daily News in 2007 as saying [...] "We did 24 takes, but they were always too sexual. Finally Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out." [...] However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode [...] "Gump Roast", while Jean stated in a piece after Taylor's death in 2011 that Taylor had said [...] "fuck you" [...] in jest and in Maggie's voice and did not storm out.|$|E

500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot found Axl Rose's {{production}} over-embellished. The Guardian {{criticized the}} album's incohesiveness, mentioning <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> compilation album, {{as well as}} calling the album [...] "exhausting to listen to", but praised Rose's melodies. Pitchfork complimented the vocals on the album, but criticized the album as sounding dated. Q considered the album overproduced, stating [...] "by throwing everything at the wall and nailing up the stuff that didn't stick, [...] done himself a grand disservice". Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, accused Rose of [...] "cribbing" [...] from the industrial rock of Nine Inch Nails. The New York Times described the album as 'a transitional album'. Rock biographer Stephen Davis was more vitriolic and named Chinese Democracy [...] "the worst album ever".|$|E

2500|$|A new group, the 5 Peace Band, which {{features}} Corea and guitarist John McLaughlin, began a world tour in October 2008. Corea had previously worked with McLaughlin in Davis's late 1960s bands, including {{the group that}} recorded Davis's album Bitches Brew. Joining Corea and McLaughlin were saxophonist Kenny Garrett and bassist Christian McBride. Drummer Vinnie Colaiuta played with the band in Europe and on select North American dates; Brian Blade played all dates in Asia and Australia, and most dates in North America. The variety of Corea's music was celebrated in a 2011 retrospective with Corea playing with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; a New York Times reviewer had high praise for the occasion: [...] "Mr. Corea was masterly with the other musicians, absorbing the rhythm and feeding the soloists. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> band, and Mr. Corea {{had no need to}} dominate; his authority was clear without raising volume." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his early}} tutors {{were among the}} first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis's style, {{according}} to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions [...] "never dreamt about" [...] by his predecessors. His trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime, blues, boogie, jazz and Western swing, and was marked by rich chord progressions, harmonics, slides and bends, and rapid changes of key. [...] He could shift quickly from finger-picking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son Thom Bresh puts it, on first hearing his father as a child [...] "I thought it was just the coolest sound, because <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar. In it, I heard rhythm parts, I heard melodies, I heard chords and all this wrapped up in one." [...] Equally at home on acoustic and electric guitar, Travis was one of the first to exploit the full range of techniques and sonorities available on the electric guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Clayton's bass guitar {{was heavily}} processed, {{to the point}} that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{keyboard}} bass (an instrument utilized on [...] "Mofo"). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob twiddling. Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, [...] "You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music—without him having to go to 11 all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out." ...|$|E
5000|$|The long-awaited {{second album}} Serena Maneesh 2: Abyss in B Minor was {{released}} in March 2010 on the renowned British independent label 4AD. According to Nikolaisen, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "rock'n'roll chamber of magic." ...|$|R

5000|$|Dan Lucas of Drowned in Sound {{was more}} {{critical}} of the album, stating, [...] "Life of Pause sounds effortless but not in <b>a</b> good way: <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> de rigueur acclaimed indie album. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> record that’s designed to be acclaimed and liked but not remembered. The extra spark that made the likes of ‘Chinatown, ‘Paradise’ or ‘The Body in Rainfall’ such magnificent, memorable tracks is missing here. It is hard to criticise such a well-crafted, enjoyable album {{that appears to have}} been made specifically with someone like me in mind. The thing is that in six weeks’ time it will be even harder to remember it." ...|$|R
