5000|$|Pippin {{files are}} tapered in width and thickness, {{generally}} of a teardrop cross section {{and having the}} edge of a <b>knife</b> <b>file.</b> Used for filing the junction of two curved surfaces and making V-shaped slots.|$|E
5000|$|Slitting {{files are}} {{parallel}} in width with a diamond-shaped cross section. Thinner than <b>knife</b> <b>files</b> and use for filing slots.|$|R
50|$|Whoever keeps {{forbidden}} items (tools, <b>knife,</b> <b>files,</b> etc.) or wears civilian clothing unauthorized, {{can be held}} {{in solitary}} confinement for suspicion of escape.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knife</b> <b>files</b> are tapered {{in width}} and {{thickness}}, but the knife edge {{has the same}} thickness the whole length, with the knife edge having an arc to it. Used for slotting or wedging operations.|$|R
50|$|Carving wax is a smooth, non-brittle wax {{designed}} for carving and/or machining. Although the formulas for most commercial waxes are proprietary, most suppliers will state that hard waxes are some blend of waxes and plastics. This family of waxes has a hardness and consistency of plastic or softer wood. They {{can be cut}} or carved with <b>knives,</b> <b>files</b> and rotary or machine tools. To illustrate the usefulness {{of this type of}} wax, if one were to get a candle, mount it on a lathe and feed a tool into it, the wax would slough off like butter, stick to the tool and make a mess. Hard wax, on the other hand, will machine more like soft aluminum, giving fine edges and a fine finish if worked properly.|$|R
5000|$|During the trial, {{prosecutor}} Sean Murphy QC {{claimed that}} the victims had been [...] "beaten with <b>knives,</b> metal <b>files,</b> a belt, and pieces of wood" [...] and [...] "hit with a bottle, punched, stabbed and stamped on the head, and had boiling water poured over them".|$|R
50|$|Camillus, {{with roots}} {{dating back to}} 1876, {{is one of the}} best known brands in the knife industry. It {{produced}} millions of <b>knives</b> until it <b>filed</b> for bankruptcy in 2007 due to fierce overseas competition.|$|R
50|$|All {{ballpoint pen}} knives come with {{straight}} blades, which {{are easier to}} conceal than curved blades. These 2 to 5 in blades are fixed to the topmost part of the pen, hidden inside a hollow cap, serving as both the pen's end and the knife's sheath. Common blades may be the single-edged thrusting type or the double-edged stiletto type. Blades can be razor-sharp or deeply serrated {{for use in a}} range of situations. Swiss Army Spectrum Series released their S.A.S.S. Ballpoints, which look and function like regular ballpoint pens. They come with an array of foldaway blades and tools including <b>knife,</b> scissors, <b>file,</b> opener, screwdriver and battery-powered light.|$|R
50|$|The Camillus Cutlery Company {{was one of}} {{the oldest}} knife {{manufacturers}} in the United States as its roots date back to 1876. The Company produced millions of <b>knives</b> until it <b>filed</b> for bankruptcy in 2007 due to fierce overseas competition and bad business skills. Its brand name and intellectual property rights were purchased by Acme United Corporation, which re-launched the Camillus brand in May 2009 using modern materials.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, Clauss Shear {{merged with}} Henkel Company, also from Fremont, Ohio, to create Henkel-Clauss Company. Henkel Company {{was founded in}} 1906 to {{manufacture}} manicure and pedicure <b>files,</b> <b>knives,</b> shears and razors. The Henkel-Clauss merger created a company with over 1,000 employees and had the largest payroll in the United States at that time. John Clauss didn’t live long to enjoy that success as he died later that same year.|$|R
2500|$|To date, {{the oldest}} {{identified}} shipwreck discovered in St. Augustine waters is the sloop Industry, a British supply ship lost on May 6, 1764, {{while attempting to}} make port with munitions, tools, and other equipment for the garrisons in Britain's recently acquired colony of Florida. [...] Artifacts from the wreck site—including eight cast-iron cannon, an iron swivel gun, crates of iron shot, iron mooring anchors, millstones, and boxes of tools such as axes, shovel blades, <b>knives,</b> trowels, <b>files,</b> and handsaws—were well-preserved, and provided an unprecedented glimpse into the needs of British soldiers and administrators on the Florida frontier. [...] Many of these items were recovered and conserved by LAMP archaeologists, and have been {{on display in the}} maritime museum in the Lighthouse keeper's house.|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table <b>knives,</b> anvils, <b>files,</b> taps and dies, rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R
50|$|The SwissCard {{is roughly}} the size of a {{business}} card, typically with a small pair of scissors, a short non-folding <b>knife,</b> a small <b>file</b> with a screwdriver point, a plastic toothpick, tweezers, a slim ballpoint pen, and a straight pin, housed in a hard plastic case of 82 × 54.5 x 4.5 mm in size, with an inch ruler on one side and metric measurements on the other. Victorinox produces three types of SwissCards, the Classic, the Quattro and the Lite model. All three models differ in the number of functions they provide, ranging from 10 (Classic) to 13 functions (Quattro and Lite).|$|R

5000|$|Warenski {{began making}} knives {{as a hobby}} in 1966 after seeing {{a picture of a}} knife made by Gil Hibben. [...] Warenski made his first <b>knife</b> from a <b>file</b> and took it to show Hibben; after seeing Hibben's {{finished}} knives, he toured Hibben's shop and learned some basic techniques from him. In June 1972 he was hired by Harvey Draper to grind blades and assist him at Draper Knives, but the operation went bankrupt by December of the same year. Warenski became a full-time knifemaker in 1975. He was a president of the Knifemakers' Guild for 2 terms and a Blade Magazine member of the Cutlery Hall of Fame.|$|R
40|$|Commonly {{available}} items {{including a}} ball point pen, a plastic knife, a broken wine bottle, {{and a broken}} wine glass were used to inflict stab and incised wounds to the necks of 3 previously euthanized Large White pigs. With relative ease, these items could be inserted into the necks of the pigs next to the jugular veins and carotid arteries. Despite precautions against the carrying of metal objects such as <b>knives</b> and nail <b>files</b> on board domestic and international flights, objects are still available within aircraft cabins {{that could be used}} to inflict serious and potentially life-threatening injuries. If airport and aircraft security measures are to be consistently applied, then consideration should be given to removing items such as glass bottles and glass drinking vessels. However, given the results of a relatively uncomplicated modification of a plastic knife, it may not be possible to remove all dangerous objects from aircraft. Security systems may therefore need to focus on measures such as increased surveillance of passenger behavior, rather than on attempting to eliminate every object that may serve as a potential weapon...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes one {{can pick}} them out; thus, on {{the borders of}} a marsh where redshanks bred, I have heard the call of that bird {{distinctly}} given by the thrush. And again, where the ring-ouzel is common, the thrush will get its brief song exactly. When thrushes taken from the nest are reared in towns, where they never hear the thrush or any other bird sing, they are often exceedingly vocal, and utter a medley of sounds which are sometimes distressing to the ear. I have heard many caged thrushes of this kind in London, but the most remarkable instance I have met with was at the little seaside town of Seaford. Here, in the main shopping street, a caged thrush lived for years in a butcher's shop, and poured out its song continuously, the most distressing throstle performance I ever heard, composed of a medley of loud, shrill and harsh sounds--imitations of screams and shouts, boy whistlers, saw <b>filing,</b> <b>knives</b> sharpened on steels, and numerous other unclassifiable noises; but all, more or less, painful. The whole street {{was filled with the}} noise, and the owner used to boast that his caged thrush was the most persistent as well as the loudest singer that had ever been heard. He had no nerves, and was proud of it! On a recent visit to Seaford I failed to hear the bird when walking about the town, and after two or three days went into the shop to enquire about it. They told me it was dead--that it had been dead over a year; also that many visitors to Seaford had missed its song and had called at the shop to ask about the bird. The strangest thing about its end, they said, was its suddenness. The bird was singing its loudest one morning, and had been at it for some time, filling the whole place with its noise, when suddenly, in the middle of its song, it dropped down dead from its perch.|$|R
5000|$|Song Yingxing {{wrote that}} ancient rulers of early China cast {{inscriptions}} of writing onto bronze tripods {{since this was}} a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls. He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron. He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 catties of copper, 4,000 catties of tin, 50 oz. of gold, and 120 oz. of silver in its composition. In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a drymold construction of lime and mortar that was dried and covered in ox fat and beeswax. Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and charcoal powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread {{on the surface of}} the wax several inches thick. When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold. With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans, metal statues, metal barrels of cannons, metallic mirrors, and different metallic coins of copper or iron. He described the processes of hammer forging with the initial casting of an anvil, and noted that in the heating process of forging, coal accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%. He also outlined the quench-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and steel products were forged. He outlined the different types of <b>knives,</b> axes, hoes, <b>file</b> tools, awls, saws, wood chisels, anchors, and metal needles that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after [...] "a hundred smeltings," [...] but the core of the sword was still made of wrought iron; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.|$|R
50|$|In {{attempting}} to stifle Ute resistance it was proposed that Ute leaders {{be taken into}} custody, in other words held hostage to prevent further raids and killings. Chief Sanpitch was arrested for threatening to attack Nephi and was confined with several others in the county courthouse in Manti. Once in chains Sanpitch agreed to help Warren Snow hunt down anyone with connections to Black Hawk. Upon Sanpitch's word Warren Snow captured several men who {{were said to have}} been with Black Hawk at one time, three were tried and executed in Manti. The rest of the Utes imprisoned in the courthouse had been permitted to visit with their wives and the fears of similar executions frightened the captives into planning an escape. The women smuggled a chisel and knives to their husbands. On the evening of March 20, 1867 five of the men made their escape. The guard managed to shoot two of the prisoners. The others were tracked down and shot dead. Those still in chains, including Sanpitch could only watch events unfold. The next day a woman and a little boy who were supposed to have aided the escapees were shot down outside Moroni, Utah. The remaining inmates decided to attempt an escape and got word to Black Hawk {{that they were going to}} attempt a second jail break. Women were still permitted visit and again smuggled <b>knives</b> and a <b>file</b> into the jail. The Utes managed to open their chains and hide it from the guards for several days. Kanosh asked for Sanpitch's release, but was refused. Black made a raid on Salina hoping to draw forces out of Manti, but Warren Snow believed the real attack would be in Sanpete Valley, so he doubled the guard on the courthouse in told his people to be prepared for a fight. Desperate to get away Sanpitch and the others made their escape the next night, April 14. One of the women managed to open the latched door, and the Utes slipped out of their shackles and into the night. The alarm was raised within minutes. Sanpitch was wounded by a random shot into the dark, but escaped. Manti was thrown into a panic as families barricaded themselves in their homes. Frightened men and boys hunted through the town looking for Utes, believing that Black Hawk himself might ride into town any minute. The Utes who were recaptured were shot down or had their throats cut. Sanpitch and four others managed to elude the searchers from Manti. They broke into a cabin and took food and blankets and headed into the foothills southwest of Fountain Green near Cedar Cliffs (now called Birch Creek), where they were spotted. On the second day the search party found Sanpitch, who had been unable to move faster because of his wound. He was killed on the spot by a local posse and buried at the base of a large rock. They tracked and shot or cut the throat of the other three escaped Utes. In an uncomfortable irony, the mountain where Sanpitch was killed now bears his name.|$|R
