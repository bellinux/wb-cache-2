Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E

After being drafted to Smackdown {{as part of the}} 2016 WWE draft which took place on July 19, Ouellet made her first appearance for the brand on July 26, where she co-hosted a Miz TV segment along her husband before being interrupted by Randy Orton, who challenged Miz to a non-title match, in which he was subsequently defeated.

25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability.

25|$|In {{the first}} {{international}} game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, {{and one or two}} players would hang around midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organised into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.|$|E
