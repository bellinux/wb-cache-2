25|$|Although Ferrero {{was known}} as one of the best clay-court players during his prime, he {{distinguished}} himself as an all-court and all-round player through his solid performance on hard- and grass-court tournaments. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> an interview that he preferred playing on hard courts. Tennis experts agreed that Ferrero's clay-court game translated well to the hard court due to his aggressive style of playing. He also had one of the greatest forehands in the game and immense speed on the court. He was sponsored by Nike, Sergio Tacchini, and Lotto Sport Italia for his apparel on court. In 2010, he signed an endorsement deal with Joma He uses Lacoste (since 2012) for his clothes, Asics for shoes and Prince Sports for his racquets. He played with a Prince EXO3 Tour 100 Mid+ (16x18) racquet.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} scientific findings, researchers recommended that a flat rate of 15° tolerable elbow extension {{be used to}} define a preliminary demarcation point between bowling and throwing. A panel of former Test players consisting of Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim May and the ICC's Dave Richardson, {{with the assistance of}} several biomechanical experts, stated that 99% of all bowlers in the history of cricket straighten their arms when bowling. Only one player tested (part-time bowler Ramnaresh Sarwan) reportedly did not transgress the pre 2000 rules. Many of these reports have controversially not been published and as such, the 99% figure stated has yet to be proved. In fact, Muralitharan stirred up controversy when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> an interview with a Melbourne radio station that Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee flexed their arms by 12, 13 and 14–15 degrees respectively, although it is unclear as to where Muralitharan quoted these figures from. Muralitharan was censured by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board for these comments.|$|E
500|$|In 1994 Keating led a {{group of}} liberals in a failed coup to remove state Senate President William Bulger, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal {{relative}} to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies. Keating's campaign failed, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> his 2010 election campaign: [...] "The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, {{is something that is}} resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent." ...|$|E

500|$|Garcia {{elected to}} become a free agent in the offseason, but he {{returned}} to the Indians, saying that his home and his dry cleaning business were in Cleveland. [...] "Everything being equal, I'll sign with the Indians if I decide I'm able to pitch... This is a friendly city and I like it", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>During</b> a spring training game in March 1959, Garcia was hit in the knee by a Billy Consolo line drive and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken to a Tucson hospital. He did not make his first season start until May 3, when he allowed four hits and no earned runs in a complete game loss. He finished with a 3–6 record, a 4.00ERA and 72 innings pitched in his twelfth and final season with the Indians.|$|E
500|$|The {{meaning of}} the Declaration was a {{recurring}} topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase [...] "all men are created equal" [...] in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify {{the independence of the}} United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any [...] "inferior or degraded race". Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. [...] "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>During</b> the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration: ...|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> the conference, [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to." ...|$|E

500|$|Pei's design {{placed the}} rigid shoebox {{at an angle}} to the {{surrounding}} street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. [...] "I can imagine only 60percent of the space in this building," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> the early stages. [...] "The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else." [...] As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon Ross Perot made a donation of US$10million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>during</b> a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|However, the U.S. Marshals Service still {{lists the}} escapees as wanted fugitives and have [...] "Wanted" [...] posters for each man. A 2014 {{study of the}} ocean {{currents}} by scientists at Delft University and the research institute Deltares indicates that a craft leaving Alcatraz at 11:30 pm on June 11, 1962, would most likely have landed {{just north of the}} Golden Gate Bridge and indicate that debris would have washed up on Angel Island, consistent with where it was actually found. A 2015 History Channel documentary presented further circumstantial evidence gathered over the years by the Anglin brothers' family, including Christmas cards allegedly sent by the brothers for three years after their escape. [...] It featured an interview with family friend Fred Brizzi, who claimed to have met the brothers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1975. To support his story, he offered a photograph of two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin, taken, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>during</b> the encounter. The documentary also presented an alternate escape theory involving the use of an electrical cord, which was reported missing from the prison's dock, tied to a passenger ferry that left the island just after midnight {{on the night of the}} men's escape.|$|E
