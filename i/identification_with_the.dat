5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily {{as a champion of}} the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical {{to the development of a}} distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} {{to evaluate the use}} of the Enteric-Tek (ET) and the AutoMicrobic system (AMS) for the identification of 201 Enterobacteriaceae freshly isolated from clinical specimens. All test systems were inoculated simultaneously from the same MacConkey agar plate. Organisms were also identified <b>with</b> conventional media. <b>Identifications</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ET and AMS agreed with those made with conventional biochemicals 97 % of the time. At a 95 % confidence level, the ET was able to identify 75 % of the isolates within 18 h without the aid of additional biochemical tests; the AMS identified 92 % in 8 h. Technologist time needed for <b>identifications</b> made <b>with</b> <b>the</b> AMS was reduced approximately 57 % compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ET. In all instances in which <b>the</b> AMS <b>identification</b> disagreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conventional, the ET identified the organism correctly. Similarly, organisms misidentified by the ET were correctly identified by the AMS. The data suggest that the AMS and ET identify clinical isolates with comparable accuracy; however, the AMS offers a significant savings in time...|$|R

40|$|Young readers’ <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> characters: <b>the</b> {{theory and}} {{practice}} of creative writing It is generally acknowledged that reader <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> characters contributes to readers’ involvement in the text and the subsequent pleasure derived from reading stories. It seems that establishing a relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> implied reader of the text comes naturally for successful authors. There is, however, a lack of coherent theory on reader <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> characters which can be used in the teaching of creative writing. This article combines insights gained from various disciplines in order to develop a coherent theory of the phenomenon of reader identification. Of special interest are the results of reader-response research regarding the relation between individuals’ development phase and <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> characters. Some of the possibilities which the writer can utilise to establish a relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reader and influence the nature of reader <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> characters are <b>the</b> choice of characters and their depiction in the text, the narrative strategy and the use of viewpoint...|$|R
