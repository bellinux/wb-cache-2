A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine isolate R 21 and compare it to other known isolates.

In this study, a virulent strain, temporarily named XY 3, was isolated from diseased codfish suffering from tail rot disease, and identified as A. hydrophila through phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics. A. hydrophila possesses multiple virulence genes including aerA, ahpA, alt, ast and hlyA genes.

40|$|Rapidly growing {{tumor cells}} require a nutrient-rich {{environment}} {{in order to}} thrive, therefore, restricting access to certain key amino acids, such as arginine, often results {{in the death of}} malignant cells, which frequently display defective cell cycle check-point control. Healthy cells, by contrast, become quiescent and remain viable under arginine restriction, displaying full recovery upon return to arginine-rich conditions. The use of arginase therapy to restrict available arginine for selectively targeting malignant cells is currently under investigation in human clinical trials. However, the suitability of this approach <b>for</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>uses</b> is unexplored. As a prelude to in vivo studies in canine malignancies, we examined the in vitro effects of arginine-deprivation on canine lymphoid and osteosarcoma cell lines. Two lymphoid and 2 osteosarcoma cell lines were unable to recover following 6 days of arginine deprivation, but all remaining cell lines displayed full recovery upon return to arginine-rich culture conditions. These remaining cell lines all proved susceptible to cell death following the addition of arginase to the cultures. The lymphoid lines were particularly sensitive to arginase, becoming unrecoverable after just 3 days of treatment. Two of the osteosarcoma lines were also susceptible over this time-frame; however the other 3 lines required 6 – 8 days of arginase treatment to prevent recovery. In contrast, adult progenitor cells from the bone marrow of a healthy dog were able to recover fully following 9 days of culture in arginase. Over 3 days in culture, arginase was mor...|$|R
40|$|Alternative therapies to {{conventional}} wound management are available now-a-days to facilitate faster wound healing without any complications. Among various alternative therapies, {{it has been}} well established that maggot therapy can be used successfully to treat chronic long-standing infected wounds which previously failed to respond {{to conventional}} treatment. Maggot therapy employs the use of freshly emerged, sterile larvae of the common greenbottle fly, Phaenicia (Lucilia) sericata, and is a form of artificially induced myiasis in a controlled clinical situation. Maggot therapy, however, is used relatively little in veterinary medicine. Nevertheless, concern over antibiotic resistance and the increase in demand for organic husbandry and residue-free meat and milk, suggest that it is an option which merits further consideration.
