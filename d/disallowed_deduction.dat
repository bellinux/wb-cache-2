40|$|The {{federal tax}} code {{includes}} numerous provisions disallowing or curtailing income tax deductions related to such disparate activities as business lobbying and providing non-performance-based compensation to senior corporate executives. The primary claim {{of this article}} is that a tendency to mentally frame business deductions as subsidies, often reinforced by rhetoric explicitly framing deductions as subsidies, helps explain these provisions. The traditional “public policy” disallowances directed at lobbying, fines and penalties paid by businesses, and antitrust treble damages respond to an appearance of a taxpayer subsidy that would follow from deduction, {{despite the fact that it}} is far from clear that these deductions, if allowed, would create an exception to taxation of net income. Disallowances directed at executive pay and other corporate governance matters also take advantage of an appearance of subsidy. In these cases, structuring an economic disincentive as a <b>disallowed</b> <b>deduction</b> (versus economically equivalent direct regulation) and explicitly framing the intervention as the elimination or curtailment of a subsidy create an illusion of lesser regulatory intervention that helps overcome opposition to the legislation. The normative implications of mental and rhetorical framing of deduction as subsidy are troubling. It is becoming increasing clear that disallowed deductions generally are a poor means of implementing economic policy, and the power of subsidy framing and rhetoric provides another reason to be skeptical of corporate governance and similar business regulation incorporated in the tax code...|$|E

50|$|The {{applicable}} {{sections of}} the Tax Code are §§ 162 and 262.

50|$|Even {{though there}} is no public policy {{exception}} to the deduction of business expenses, the Code itself imposes some public policy based exceptions. For example, § 162(c)(1) <b>disallows</b> a <b>deduction</b> for illegal bribes or kickbacks to a domestic government official or agency, and § 162(f) <b>disallows</b> a <b>deduction</b> for fines paid to the government for violating the law. Furthermore, § 280E prevents a taxpayer from taking a deduction related to the business of selling illegal controlled substances. So while the Tellier court states that the federal tax is not meant to be a sanction for wrongdoing, there are often public policy prohibitions embedded in the Code itself.|$|R

Kroy required the court to decide whether § 162 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code, an exception to § 162 (a), applied to these fees and would preclude their deduction. Section 162 (k) <b>disallows</b> <b>deduction</b> of any expenses incurred 2 ̆ 2 in connection with 2 ̆ 2 a stock redemption.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effects of income {{taxation}} on enforcement of business regulations. The key result is that income taxation makes it less socially costly {{to enforce the law}} and therefore allows the attainment of a higher level of deterrence. The explanation for this result is that income taxation reduces the gains businesses derive from violating the law, but it does not affect, at least not to the same extent, the feasible fine. This result is true, regardless of whether fines are deductible for tax purposes or not, as long as the probability and magnitude of fines optimally reflect tax rules and tax rates, as this article argues they should do. However, if the probability and magnitude of fines do not change in response to income tax changes, <b>disallowing</b> <b>deductions</b> for fines, which is the prevailing tax rule in many jurisdictions, is socially desirable for sufficiently low tax rates or tax rate changes...|$|R
50|$|Even where countries’ {{corporate}} laws permit {{companies to}} be thinly capitalised, revenue authorities {{in those countries}} will often limit the amount that a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest, particularly when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (e.g. from connected parties).

5000|$|Eaton {{argues that}} the IRS's {{decision}} to permit deductions for Scientologists exceeded its statutory authority. The Supreme Court found that the law did not permit quid pro quo payments of the kind made by Scientologists.

If the regulation were to be challenged, Eaton suggests, a reviewing court would likely {{come to the same}} conclusion as the Supreme Court and <b>disallow</b> the <b>deductions.</b> However, there appears to be little likelihood of the issue coming before a court as taxpayers do not have standing to challenge the regulation.|$|R
