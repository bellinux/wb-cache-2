40|$|From {{preliminary}} idea of {{a design}} until a fully functioned product, the use of data format is different in every stages of process. Data generated in design process is rich in geometry and topological format. Whereas, manufacturing process requires manufacturing feature-based data. Therefore, {{there is a need}} o database which is not only able for storing and retrieving data, but also able to extract and separate the geometry and topological data for use of subsequent process. This paper proposes a database system for extracting and separating the geometry and topological data from STEP AP 203 (<b>drawing</b> <b>file)</b> based on EXPRESS entities and stored in the STEP database. This database system is built by using Microsoft Access relational database system. The strength of Microsoft Access relational database system is the ability to store large amounts of data in a highly normalized, tabular form, and to perform efficient quires across large data sets. Relational systems use Structured Query Language (SQL) for both data definition and data manipulation. At this moment, the databases is developed by using Microsoft Access and the advantage of this database is the ability to migrate into other advanced RDBMS and this extracted geomerty and topological data is beneficial for advanced STEP feature-based manufacturing process...|$|E

40|$|This {{engineering}} note contains {{information about}} the measured clearances along the chimney route from the solenoid to the control dewar. This type of information is best conveyed by sketches and a few photos. Twelve photos taken on 2 / 17 / 94 are included which gIVe perspective views along the path. The detector was parked in the collision hall on this date. The CF iron was split open {{to the east and}} the South EF iron was rolled back. Also the South EndCap Calorimeter was rolled to the south on this day. This allowed personnel access and the photographic opportunity. A full set of raw dimensional sketches are included. These sketches were generated by me using a 25 foot tape measure and a note pad. The sketches are in chronological order with the most recent on top. The first sketch, 5 / 18 / 94, describes the 'tightest' location for the upward incline portion of the chimney. The sketches on 2 / 14 / 94 thru 2 / 16 / 94 are refinements of the early 1992 and 1993 sketches. They pick out quite a bit more detail of specific detector components along the path. The dimensional sketches of 1992 and 1993 gave information in not as much detail and therefore gave a more constrained clearance description. Most of the information of the early sketches was jotted down on the plan view dated 10 - 29 - 92. This sketch also had some information lifted from prints which later was superseded by the 1994 sketches. I tried to label components and give views either titled 'Elevation' or 'Plan' which refers to a top view looking down. Also where I could I jotted down direction, ie. South, East etc. Hopefully with a little effort one can decifer it. The curvature of the CC was determined from a three dimensional topographical survey. This survey information is stored in an electronic <b>drawing</b> <b>file</b> 3823. 111 -ME- 317165, 'Solenoid-CC south face 3 D shape survey'. The 'z' dimensions for the radial chimney path were picked off this drawing. A curvature was then generated knowing many points by radial and z coordinates. This curve is stored in <b>drawing</b> <b>file</b> 3823. 111 -ME 317164, 'Solenoid-CC south face-chimney contour layout'. All drawings mentioned above are kept in hard copy form in the D-Zero drawing files. The electronic 'master' copy is kept in the XDCS drawing control system, dOms vault. The information contained in this engineering note could be very useful for those who are interested in the clearances and shape of the solenoid chimney path.

40|$|A {{casting process}} CAD is put forward {{to design and}} draw casting process. The 2 D casting process CAD, most of the current systems are {{developed}} based on one certain version of the AutoCAD system. However the application of these 2 D casting process CAD systems in foundry enterprises are restricted because they have several deficiencies, such as being overly dependent on the AutoCAD system, and some part files based on PDF format can not be opened directly. To overcome these deficiencies, {{for the first time}} an innovative 2 D casting process CAD system based on PDF and image format file has been proposed, which breaks through the traditional research and application notion of the 2 D casting process CAD system based on AutoCAD. Several key technologies of this system such as coordinate transformation, CAD interactive <b>drawing,</b> <b>file</b> storage, PDF and image format files display, and image recognition technologies were described in detail. A practical 2 D CAD casting process system named HZCAD 2 D(PDF) was developed, which is capable of designing and drawing the casting process on the part drawing based on the PDF format directly, without spending time on drawing the part produced by AutoCAD system. Finally, taking two actual castings as examples, the casting processes were drawn using this system, demonstrating that this system can significantly shorten the cycle of casting process designing...|$|E

The visualization tool, referred to as “The Steel Connections Teaching Toolkit”, has as it’s basis the Steel Teaching Sculpture designed by Dr. Duane Ellifritt, Professor Emeritus at the University of Florida and originally constructed on campus in 1986. The teaching toolkit is comprised of a three-dimensional CAD <b>drawing</b> <b>file,</b> shear connection calculator tool, and a teaching guide document.

40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{analysis of}} a celestial object orbiting another body {{is the basis for}} all other, more complex theories of spacecraft motion. It is also highly important for the design and construction of spacecraft. New computer software SATELIGHT is developed for computing the satellite coordinates with respect to the Earth centre or to the point on its surface, in orbit plane or in right ascension system. A dynamic model is presented by second order differential equations solved numerically. The numerical method used is Runge Kutta IV order. Initial conditions are based on the orbit characteristics - shape and orientation, and are result of mission objectives and constraints analysis. The model is developed gradually. The starting stage is solving the so-called Kepler 2 ̆ 7 s two body problem which includes only gravitational force without any perturbing forces. This model is ftirther modified for anomalies of the Earth gravitational field, atmospheric drag and three body problem - influence of Moon on the trajectory of the Earth satellite. The model for the Three-Body perturbation gives solution for any situation in the space and computes change in the orbit inclination angle. The coordinates are obtained in numerical form with adjustable precision, depending on the computer capability. Results could be transferred to the Excel and by using a particular program could be imported into ACAD and plotted as a <b>drawing</b> <b>file.</b> This gives great visual presentation in two dimensions, with opportunity to effectively compare, measure and fiirther manipulate imported data.

40|$|På uppdrag av CWR Engineering AB har en undersökning utförts över huruvida det är möjligt att skapa ett verktyg som kan hjälpa den mekaniska konstruktören inom processindustrin att höja kvalitetssäkringen och effektiviteten i sitt arbete med utrustningsritningar. Arbetet i utvecklingsprocessen i processindustrin strävar mot en tvärfunktionalitet. All konstruktion grundas i Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) där processen för exempelvis en kemikaliefabrik beskrivs i 2 D-format med rörledningar, utrustningar och {{instrument}} specificerat till sort, men inte position. Dessa utrustningar ska sedan beskrivas detaljerat i en 2 D-ritning. 2 D-ritningen är i sin tur underlag för modellering av utrustningen i 3 D. Till sist placeras 3 D-modellen ut i fabrikslayouten i en 3 D-miljö. Fabrikslayouten är i sin tur också styrd av P&IDschemat. En utrustningsritning skiljer sig från en vanlig mekanisk ritning så till vida att den inte har någon standard för vyplacering, så som en mekanisk ritning kan ha en europeisk eller amerikansk vyplacering. Utrustningsritningen ska uppfylla krav för att positionsbestämma och definiera alla komponenter, vilket kan göras på olika sätt. Upplägget för dessa ritningar skapar risk för fel, vilket det framtagna verktyget skall bygga bort. I detta arbete avgränsades studien till tankar med dess studsar. Arbetet har resulterat i ett layoutkoncept för en applikation i konstruktörens datamiljö vilken skapar en inbyggd felsäkring i arbetsprocessen samt effektiviserar arbetet i och med enklare arbetsprocess. Konceptet har arbetats fram genom analys av arbetsprocessen och de programvaror konstruktören använder i sitt arbete. Ett flöde för den tekniska hanteringen har identifierats och utifrån dessa data har konceptframtagningen genomförts. Layoutkonceptet består av tre delar. Ett ritningsfilhanteringsformulär vilket skapar, raderar, reviderar och korrelerar statusen för alla utrustningar i P&ID. All information om dessa scheman lagras i en Microsoft SQL serverdatabas och kan med hjälp av Microsoft Visual Studio användas för att skapa, styra och kontrollera utrustningsritningarna, vilka ritas i 2 D-CADprogrammet SmartSketch. I SmartSketch arbetar konstruktören i dagsläget med symboler, vilka är färdigritade statiska komponenter konstruktören kan positionera ut på ritningen och sedan ändra storlekens i olika skalor. Dessa finns i olika typer beroende på studstyp. Andra delen av konceptet består av att göra dessa symboler dynamiska och drivna parametriskt via en byggmåttsdatabas. Information om studsens storlek, måttstandard, tryckklass, typ av ände kommer från P&IDdatan, vilken sedan hämtar information om byggmått i en databas till symbolen och symbolen får sedan rätt storlek och kan placeras ut på tanken. Symbolmängden kan därför dras ner då symbolens grafik ändras parametriskt. Om någon faktor för studsen skulle komma att ändras uppdateras då symbolen automatiskt. Konstruktören kan också manuellt ändra variabler så som storlek eller tryckklass även innan ändringen hunnit ske i P&ID, som en del i tvärfunktionaliteten. Den tredje huvudfunktionaliteten för konceptet är granskning av ritningen genom data över positionering, vyöverensstämmelse och identiteter för studsarna. Granskningen rapporteras i en PDF-fil och i ett dialogfönster. On {{behalf of}} CWR Engineering AB a development project has taken place. The {{goal of the}} project was {{to determine whether or not}} it is possible to create an application which can make working process of the mechanical engineer, in the process industry, run with higher quality assurance and efficiency whilst creating equipment drawings. The development process within process industry strives towards being cross- functional. All design is based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), where the process, for example a chemical plant, described in 2 D where the piping, equipment and instruments are specified to type, but not position. The equipment is then described in detail in a 2 D drawing. The 2 D drawing in turn is the basis for the equipment when creating it in 3 D. Finally, the 3 D model is placed into the factory layout in a 3 D environment. The factory layout correspond to the design determined in the P&ID. An equipment drawing differs from a standard mechanical drawing in the sense that it has no standard for its views, such as a mechanical drawing can be designed by either a European or an American standard. The equipment drawing must however still meet the requirements of defining all components described within the P&ID, which can be done in some different ways. The format for these drawings creates possibilities for error, which the developed application is to prevent. In this project, the study was limited to tanks with its nozzles. The project has resulted in a layout concept for an application in the engineer's computer environment which creates a built-in error-proofing in the working process. It makes the process more efficient. The concept has been developed through analyzing the working process used today and the software the engineer uses in his work. A flow for the technical information have been identified and based on these data, the concept has been developed. The layout concept consists of three parts. First, a <b>drawing</b> <b>file</b> management form which creates, deletes, revises and correlate the status of all equipment drawings to the data in P&ID. All data from these diagrams are stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database. Using Microsoft Visual Studio this data can be used to create, manage and control the equipment drawings in a semi-automated way. The drawings are created in 2 D CAD software SmartSketch. The SmartSketch user is currently using symbols, which are pre-drawn static components which the user can place on the drawing and then scale to preferred size. These symbols are available in various executions depending on the nozzle to be placed. The second part of the concept consists of making these symbols dynamic and driven parametrically through a dimensions database. Information about the standpipe size, dimensions standard, pressure rating and end preparation comes from the P&ID data, which then retrieves information about parametric dimensions in a database. The symbol automatically receives correct dimensions and can be placed on the tank. The amount of symbols can therefore be reduced since the symbol's graphic changes parametrically. If any variable of the nozzle is be changed, the symbol will automatically be updated. The user can also manually change variables such as size and pressure class, even before the changes take place in the P&ID, as a part of cross- functionality. The third main functionality of the concept is the examination of the drawing data pertaining to the positioning and view conformity of the nozzles. The examination result is to be reported in a PDF file and in a dialog window...|$|E
