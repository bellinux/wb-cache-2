25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E

However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> <b>of</b> Boe, stating [...] "the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies".
