5000|$|Like the zodiacal light, the <b>gegenschein</b> is {{sunlight}} scattered by interplanetary dust. Most of this dust is {{orbiting the}} Sun {{in about the}} ecliptic plane, with a possible concentration of particles at the [...] Earth-Sun Lagrangian point.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{effect is}} the <b>Gegenschein,</b> which is seen {{directly}} opposite to the Sun's {{position in the}} sky. It is much fainter than the Zodiacal light, and is caused by sunlight reflecting off dust particles outside the Earth's orbit.|$|E
50|$|S-1 {{involved}} Cooper {{taking the}} first photographs of the zodiacal light and the <b>gegenschein</b> from orbit. There was also syntopic photography of Earth.

50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from zodiacal light by its high {{angle of reflection}} of the incident sunlight on the dust particles.

5000|$|In 1854, Brorsen {{published}} the first thorough {{investigations of the}} so-called <b>gegenschein</b> (counter shine) of the Zodiacal light. He was also able to explain that phenomenon correctly. Besides, Brorsen {{was the first to}} discover that the Zodiacal light can embrace the complete sky, because, under favorable conditions, a feeble light bridge connecting the Zodiacal light and the counter glow can be observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{zodiacal light}} {{decreases}} in intensity with {{distance from the}} Sun, but in naturally dark skies, it is visible as a band completely around the ecliptic. In fact, the zodiacal light covers the entire sky and is {{largely responsible for the}} total natural skylight on a moonless, clear night. Another phenomenon—a faint, but slightly brighter, oval glow—directly opposite of the Sun is the <b>gegenschein.</b>|$|E

50|$|Also, on a moonless {{night away}} from city lights, the <b>gegenschein</b> is often visible around that point, {{arising from the}} {{backscattering}} of light by interplanetary dust. In astronomy, when the Moon or planets are in opposition, they are coplanar with the antisolar point. During a total lunar eclipse, the full Moon enters the umbra of Earth's shadow, which the planet has been casting onto its atmosphere, into space, and toward the antisolar point.|$|E

Due to aiming errors, no useful data was returned. Other non-lunar targets were the zodiacal light and the corona of the Sun.|$|E
50|$|Elvey {{worked at}} the Yerkes Observatory and later served as astronomer-in-charge at McDonald Observatory. His {{research}} included investigating the spectra of stars, galactic light, aurorae, and the <b>gegenschein.</b> During 1939-40 he worked with fellow Yerkes Observatory astronomers Otto Struve (his former teacher) and Christine Westgate to study the rate of rotation in higher mass stars via spectroscopy. During World War II, he performed applied research into rocket ballistics at the California Institute of Technology. He then joined the China Lake U. S. Naval Ordnance Test Station, becoming head of staff in 1951.|$|E
50|$|At {{any given}} time, {{one side of}} the planet Earth is bathed in light from the Sun (the daytime) and {{the other side of the}} Earth is in the shadow caused by the Earth {{blocking}} the light of the sun. This shadow is called the umbra. Natural illumination is still provided by a combination of moonlight, planetary light, starlight, diffuse zodiacal light, <b>gegenschein,</b> and airglow. In some circumstances, bioluminescence, aurorae, and lightning can provide some illumination. The glow provided by artificial illumination is sometimes referred to as light pollution because it can interfere with observational astronomy and ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Zodiacal {{light is}} {{produced}} by sunlight reflecting off dust particles in the Solar System known as cosmic dust. Consequently, its spectrum {{is the same as}} the solar spectrum. The material producing the zodiacal light is located in a lens-shaped volume of space centered on the sun and extending well out beyond the orbit of Earth. This material is known as the interplanetary dust cloud. Since most of the material is located near the plane of the Solar System, the zodiacal light is seen along the ecliptic. The amount of material needed to produce the observed zodiacal light is quite small. If it were in the form of 1 mm particles, each with the same albedo (reflecting power) as Earth's moon, each particle would be 8 km from its neighbors. The <b>gegenschein</b> may be caused by particles directly opposite the Sun as seen from Earth, which would be in full phase.|$|E
5000|$|Ney's {{studies of}} the corona piqued his curiosity about other sources of dim light within the solar system. Consequently, Ney and Huch {{developed}} reliable cameras whose low F-number enhanced their ability to record dim light, but sacrificed picture sharpness.

50|$|The {{source of}} the dust has been long debated. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} the dust {{originated}} from the tails of active comets and from collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. Many of our meteor showers have no known active comet parent bodies. Over 85 percent of the dust is attributed to occasional fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets that are nearly dormant. Jupiter-family comets have orbital periods of less than 20 years and are considered dormant when not actively outgassing, but may do so in the future. The first fully dynamical model of the zodiacal cloud demonstrated that only if the dust was released in orbits that approach Jupiter, is it stirred up enough to explain the thickness of the zodiacal dust cloud. The dust in meteoroid streams is much larger, 300 to 10,000 micrometres in diameter, and falls apart into smaller zodiacal dust grains over time.The Poynting-Robertson effect forces the dust into more circular (but still elongated) orbits, while spiralling slowly into the Sun. Hence a continuous source of new particles is needed to maintain the zodiacal cloud. Cometary dust and dust generated by collisions among the asteroids are believed to be mostly responsible for the maintenance of the dust cloud producing the zodiacal light and the <b>gegenschein.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Gegenschein</b> {{is viewed}} by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI), which has {{provided}} near-full-sky broadband visible-light photometric maps for over 5 years. These have an angular resolution of about 0. 5 ? and differential photometric stability of about 1 % throughout this time. When individual bright stars are removed from the maps and an empirical sidereal background subtracted, the residue {{is dominated by the}} zodiacal light. The unprecedented sky coverage and duration of these measurements enables a definitive characterization of the <b>Gegenschein.</b> This article describes the analysis method for these data, presents a movie with time of the <b>Gegenschein</b> brightness distribution, determines empirical formulae describing its average shape, and discusses its variation with time. These measurements unambiguously confirm previous reports that the <b>Gegenschein</b> surface-brightness distribution has a decided peak in the antisolar point, which rises above a broader background. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Investigations to {{determine}} {{the source of the}} <b>gegenschein</b> indicated: (1) The <b>gegenschein</b> is an effect, not a thing, and is due to an increase in the reflectivity, near opposition, of dust particles in heliocentric orbits, and is not due to an accumulation of material near the earth. (2) The density of the reflecting particles increases outside the earth's orbit; therefore, it can be explained by dust produced by collisions between asteroids. A cometary origin for the material is considered unlikely...|$|E
40|$|We made optical {{observations}} of the <b>Gegenschein</b> using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled wide-field camera, Wide-field Imager of Zodiacal light with ARray Detector (WIZARD), between March 2003 and November 2006. We found a narrow brightness enhancement superimposed on the smooth gradient of the <b>Gegenschein</b> at the exact position of the antisolar point. Whereas the <b>Gegenschein</b> morphology changed according to the orbital motion of the Earth, the maximum brightness coincided with the antisolar direction throughout the year. We compared the observed morphology of the <b>Gegenschein</b> with those of models in which the spatial density of the interplanetary dust cloud was considered {{and found that the}} volume scattering phase function had a narrow backscattering enhancement. The morphology was reproducible with a spatial distribution model for infrared zodiacal emission. It is likely that the zero-phase peak (the so-called opposition effect) was caused by coherent backscattering and/or shadow-hiding effects on the rough surfaces of individual dust particles. These results suggest that big particles are responsible for both zodiacal light and zodiacal emission. Finally, we derived the geometric albedo of the smooth component of interplanetary dust, assuming big particles, and obtained a geometric albedo of 0. 06 +- 0. 01. The derived albedo is in accordance with collected dark micrometeorites and observed cometary dust particles. We concluded that chondritic particles are dominant near Earth space, supporting the recent theoretical study by dynamical simulation.

30|$|We {{summarize}} {{the results of}} our <b>Gegenschein</b> observations at Norikura (altitude 2876 m, Japan) in Sept. 18, 1996, and at Kiso (altitude 1130 m, Japan) in Feb. 9 – 14, and March 4 and 5, 1997. The instrument consisting of fish-eye lens or the wide angle lens attached to the cooled CCD camera was used with green filter. It is found that the position of the maximum brightness near the antisolar point (the <b>Gegenschein)</b> is slightly deviated approximately 0.° 4 from the antisolar point to the south in September, whereas nearly 0.° 7 to the north in February/March. Furthermore, a gradient of the relative intensity along a line perpendicular to the ecliptic is remarkably different with changing seasons, i.e. the brightness decreases faster towards the north in September, in contrast with its quick decrease towards the south in February/March. Our observed evidence suggests that these variations of the peak position and the brightness gradient of the <b>Gegenschein</b> are caused by the annual motion of the Earth with respect to the plane of the zodiacal cloud, and does not conflict with the predictions deduced from the cloud model having its symmetric plane beyond the Earth’s orbit coinciding with the invariable plane of the solar system.|$|E
