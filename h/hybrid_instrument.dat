30|$|Focusing on {{the timing}} variables, the {{issuance}} of debt (Column 1) is preceded by issuances of debt (Issuer Debt in t- 4 to t- 12 statistically significant) and <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> (both Issuer <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Instruments</b> in t- 4 to t- 12 and Issuer <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Instruments</b> in t- 4 to t- 12 statistically significant), but not issuances of capital. Similarly, issuances of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> are preceded by other issuances of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> and by issuances of debt. However, the probability of issuing capital is not correlated with {{the issuance of}} debt but increases with the issuances of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> {{during the last three}} months. Table  4 shows that the coefficients that are statistically different from zero are also statistically different across types of issuances. Therefore, banks that finance their growth with issuances of debt also increase their issuances of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments,</b> which indicates that they are managing their regulatory capital holdings using <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> to comply with the higher requirements due to the increase in debt holdings. Further evidence for this finding is provided by the variable Low Capital, which is positive and statistically significant at 10 % in <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> whereas it is not statistically significant for capital, which indicates that banks whose regulatory capital is close to the minimum are likely to issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> but not capital instruments. Given that the threshold of 8 % is exogenous, the issuance of capital instruments might be a response to maintain or increase their Basel ratios by using only hybrid capital, which means they want to minimize the cost of regulatory compliance.|$|R

40|$|Data {{recently}} {{published by the}} Reserve Bank of Australia clearly demonstrates that after a period in abeyance, <b>hybrid</b> financial <b>instruments</b> have again become popular tools for capital raising and management. This raises several questions of practical and theoretical significance, particularly {{in relation to the}} motivation for adopting <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> as an element of firm capital structure, and the impact of putting this choice into effect. In this paper, we examine two key themes. First, we analyse {{the extent to which the}} rise of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> can be justified on the grounds that the use of these instruments can result in lower firm cost of capital. We also investigate the impact on firm financial reports and key metrics of financial performance of risk which result from the deployment of <b>hybrid</b> financial <b>instruments</b> as components of firm capital structure. We conclude by expressing scepticism as to the proposition that the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> systematically lowers issuer cost of capital, and argue that the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> has caused material distortions to emerge within the financial statements of firms which employ them. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{compartmentalisation}} {{of company}} finance into equity and debt does not truly capture the enormous diversity of financial instruments available. A {{wide variety of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> incorporate elements of both equity and debt. From a fiscal point of view the classification of such <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> as equity or debt is crucial for two reasons. First of all, the issuer can treat interest on the latter as tax-deductible in most cases, and secondly, for the investor the classification determines whether the payments received from the respective instrument is treated as a dividend or as interest.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of the paper is {{analytical}} research of taxation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> in context of the EU parent-subsidiary directive. Efforts to harmonize taxation inside EU created negative side effects, which were unforeseen. The taxation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> became of the great importance as it created possibilities for development of schemes inside cross-border groups, which are somewhere in between of tax avoidance and tax evasion. This situation was recognized and the EU parent-subsidiary directive was amended in the year 2014. Member states are required to transpose amendments to national law {{by the end of}} the year 2015. Possible problems of implementation of amendments are presented on the example of Lithuania.

40|$|Two {{concepts}} are presented, extended, and unified in this paper: mobile device augmentation towards musical instruments {{design and the}} concept of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments.</b> The first consists of using mobile devices at the heart of novel musical instruments. Smartphones and tablets are augmented with passive and active elements that can take part in the production of sound (e. g., resonators, exciter, etc.), add new affordances to the device, or change its global aesthetics and shape. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> combine physical/acoustical and “physically informed” virtual/digital elements. Recent progress in physical modeling of musical instruments and digital fabrication is exploited to treat instrument parts in a multidimensional way, allowing any physical element to be substituted with a virtual one and vice versa (as long as it is physically possible). A wide range of tools to design mobile <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> is introduced and evaluated.

30|$|Five {{findings}} {{emerge from}} our analysis. First, {{we find that}} banks issue financial instruments to cover liquidity needs and growth opportunities during the sample period. The choices among the available instruments respond {{to a combination of}} capital regulation and the costs of asymmetric information. Indeed, banks’ preferred choice to finance growth is debt, in line with the pecking order. Second, to comply with capital regulation given the growth of assets, banks prefer to issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> rather than capital instruments, which is also in line with the existence of discount costs from asymmetric information. This finding is supported by the evidence that banks close to the regulatory minimum are more likely to issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> than common shares. We find that the probability of issuing debt increases after the issuance of <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> during the last 12 months, and the decision to issue <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> is also positively affected by the issuance of debt during the previous 12 months. Third, the preference for issuing debt and hybrid capital explains the constant distribution of Basel capital ratios while the weight of core capital over the total regulatory capital decreases. Fourth, the issuance of capital instruments is more likely in banks listed in the stock markets and banks operating internationally, possibly because they are well-known to the markets and suffer from a lower (if any) discount at issuance due to asymmetric information. Fifth, banks might raise capital instruments to improve their soundness if the level of loan loss provisions is low and/or the risk of their assets (loans) is high.|$|R
