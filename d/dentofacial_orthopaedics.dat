50|$|There is {{a totally}} {{different}} orthodontics approach without extraction and pain, is called functional orthodontics, the functional orthodontic technology is different and called functional appliance, that is an appliance that produces {{all or part of}} its effect by altering the position of the mandible/maxilla. Also known as <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> appliances, these appliances utilize the muscle action of the patient and responses of nervous system to produce orthodontic or orthopaedic forces. Various functional appliances have been described. There is a List of Orthodontic Functional Appliances.|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} growth modifications of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> treatment, specific functional appliances {{have been used}} experimentally to prompt the mandible into a protrusive position in various animal models. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the effectiveness of a functional appliance specially designed for sheep and to evaluate the sheep as a model for <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> research. Eight, 4 -month-old, castrated male Merino sheep were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, with four in each group. Cast functional appliances were fabricated for the animals in the experimental group. The treatment period was 15 weeks. Dental casts, endosseous implant markers and cephalograms were used to analyse the displacement of the mandible. Undemineralised sagittal sections of TMJ were used to evaluate the tissue responses induced by the appliances. The weight of the animals was measured monthly to monitor their growth. The growth of the metacarpus was also measured. During the experimental period, the animals maintained their weight within the normal range and grew normally. The appliance displaced the mandible to a downward and forward position. The adaptive responses in the TMJ induced by the appliances included changed anteroposterior shape of the condylar process, anteriorly thickened condylar cartilage, and a thickened compact bone layer along the anterior surface of the posterior wall of the glenoid fossa. The sheep coped well with the experimental procedures and the appliance used was demonstrably effective in inducing adaptive responses in the TMJ. Consequently, it is believed that the sheep is an appropriate animal model to study growth modifications in the TMJ region.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Identification of {{skeletal}} maturation phases is {{of primary}} importance {{in terms of}} individual responsiveness to nearly all <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> treatments. In this regard, dentition phase and chronological age are still widely used to define the timing of and responsiveness to orthodontic treatments. Recently, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity {{has been shown to}} be a reliable biomarker of skeletal maturation in growing subjects. Here, for the first time, circumpubertal dentition phases and chronological age were evaluated for correlations with GCF ALP activity, as a biomarker of skeletal maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five healthy growing subjects (51 females, 34 males; mean age, 11. 7 ± 2. 3 years) were enrolled into this double-blind, prospective, cross-sectional-design study. Samples of GCF were collected from each subject at the mesial and distal sites of both of the central incisors, at the maxillary and mandibular arches. Their dentition phases were recorded as intermediate mixed, late mixed, or permanent. GCF ALP enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: The dentition phases showed median GCF ALP activities from 42. 0 to 67. 5 mU/sample. Although these were slightly greater for the permanent dentition, no significant differences were seen. Also, the chronological age did not correlate significantly with GCF ALP activity, and no significant differences were seen between maxillary and mandibular sites in any of the comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment for treatment timing of dentofacial disharmonies in individual patients that require monitoring of their skeletal maturation phases should not rely on their circumpubertal dentition phase and chronological ag...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade magnets {{have been used in}} {{orthodontic}} and <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedics</b> and {{attempts have been made to}} evaluate the biological implications of magnets and magnetic fields during clinical application. This review aims to indicate the advantages and disadvantages of magnets in orthodontics and <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedics</b> over traditional techniques, and update related clinical experiences. The treatment of impacted teeth and Class II malocclusions by means of magnetic force is favoured and the correction of Class III and open bite malocclusions involving the use of magnets also appears promising. The advantages of magnets over traditional force delivery systems are: frictionless mechanics, when the magnets are in attractive configuration; predictable force levels, no force decay over time and less patient co-operation. However, the size of the magnets can increase the bulk of the appliance and three-dimensional control is limited when the magnets are in a repulsive configuration. In addition magnets used in vivo require a coating to prevent corrosion and the possible side effects of corrosive product...|$|E

Skeletal maturation based on hand-wrist radiograph and cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) are commonly used methods of growth assessment. Studies have shown that stages of dental calcification {{can also be used}} to assess skeletal maturation status of an individual, whereas other studies have suggested that the relationship between dental calcification and skeletal maturation should be interpreted with caution owing to racial variation. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between permanent mandibular second molar calcification stages and skeletal maturity assessed by CVM among a group of Nepalese orthodontic patients. Materials and methods: One hundred and sixty-eight digital radiographs (84 orthopantomograms and 84 lateral cephalograms) were obtained from the records of 84 patients who sought orthodontic treatment in Orthodontic and <b>Dentofacial</b> <b>Orthopaedic</b> Unit, Department of Dentistry, Institute of Medicine, Kathmandu. Two parameters were used in this study, namely, CVM stages from lateral cephalogram and Demirjian index (DI) stages from orthopantomogram. The evaluation of digital radiographs was carried out on a computer screen with a resolution of 1, 280 × 800 pixels. The association between DI stages of permanent mandibular second molar and CVM stages was assessed. Results: A statistically significant association was found between DI and CVM stages for both male and female subjects with Pearson&# 39;s contingency coefficient value of 0. 751 and 0. 766 for male and female subjects, respectively. Conclusion: Skeletal maturation can be reliably assessed with dental calcification stages of permanent mandibular second molar for Nepalese orthodontic patients.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} growth modifications of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> treatment, various functional appliances {{have been used}} to prompt the mandible into a protrusive position in various animal experimental models. The general purpose of this project was (i) to test the effectiveness of a functional appliance specially designed for sheep; (ii) to clarify whether or not forward mandibular displacement in sheep is associated with faster and/or redirected condylar growth; (iii) to evaluate the sheep as a model for <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> research by comparing the similarities of mandibular condylar growth in sheep and humans; (iv) to detail the position of the mandible during forward mandibular posturing and the effects of mandibular forward displacement on modelling and remodelling of the mandibular condyle. The specific purpose of this project was to reveal whether functional appliance treatment increases the quantity of bone formed during the treatment, or changes the distribution of the bone, or both. Eight, 4 -month old, castrated male Merino sheep were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups with 4 in each group. Cast functional appliances were fabricated for the animals in the experimental group. The treatment period was 15 weeks. Calcein (day 1) tetracycline (13 weeks) and alizarin red S (3 days before sacrifice) fluorochromes were administered to all animals. Dental casts, endosseous implant markers and cephalograms were used to analyse the 3 -D displacement of the mandible. Undecalcified mid-sagittal sections of TMJ were used to evaluate the tissue responses induced by the appliances. Dynamic parameters of bone formation, static indices of bone-forming and resorbing activity as well as structural indices of trabecular bone were estimated using histomorphometry. The trabecular bone was sampled from two regions: (i) a subchondral region; (determined by 2 nd and 3 rd labels), believed to comprise bone newly-formed during the experimental period; and (ii) a central region (labelled by all the three fluorochromes), believed to comprise bone which existed before the experiment. The cortical bone was divided into anterior and posterior regions for analysis. The weight of the animals was measured monthly to monitor their growth. Metacarpus growth was also evaluated. During the experimental period, the animals were found to maintain their weight within the normal range and grew normally. The appliance was found to displace the mandible to a downward and forward position with a net condylar displacement of 2. 4 mm. The observed adaptive responses in the TMJ induced by the appliances included; the condylar process was less tapered and rounder in the experimental group than in the controls, and anteriorly thickened condylar cartilage and a thickened compact bone layer along the anterior surface of the posterior wall of the glenoid fossa. The mandibular condylar growth vector in sheep was found to be in a postero-superior direction. Condylar growth in the control sheep during the experimental period varied from 8. 8 to 11. 9 mm, with the mean being 10. 6 mm, which is quantitatively similar to two years of condylar growth in human adolescents. In the experimental sheep, the condylar growth varied from 8. 5 to 13. 3 mm, with the mean being 11. 4 mm. When metacarpal growth and weight gain were taken into consideration using multivariant analysis, the coefficients for growth in the postero-superior and posterior direction were found to be high, with adjusted r 2 as 0. 84 and 0. 82 respectively. The induced condylar growth was estimated to be largest in the posterior direction (2. 3 mm), which is also similar to previous reports in humans. Regional differences in adaptive response within the mandibular condyle were found in this study. In the experimental group, bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the subchondral regions decreased, although the specific bone surface and bone formation rates increased. This low BV/TV was associated with decreased trabecular thickness and increased trabecular separation. In the central region of the experimental group's condyle, BV/TV was unchanged. However, an increased osteoid surface (OS/BS) was defined when the eroded surface (ES/BS) was taken into consideration. The sheep were found to cope well with the experimental procedures and the appliance used in this study has been effective in inducing adaptive responses in the TMJ. Consequently, it is believed that the sheep is an appropriate animal model for quantitative histological analysis of the responses to functional appliance treatment. The first null hypothesis, that functional appliance treatment has no effect on bone matrix mineralisation was rejected. The second null hypothesis, functional appliance treatment has no effect on the mineralisation lag time, was rejected. The results indicated that the treatment effects of functional appliances involve reorganisation of the TMJ through bone modelling and remodelling. An important mechanism of functional appliance treatment is, therefore, suggested to be a change in the distribution of bone rather than an increase in the quantity of bone. Posterior rotation of the principle tensile strain angle (Et) suggested an posteriorly altered direction of the condylar growth. Increased new bone formation in the glenoid fossa suggested an anterior re-positioning of the temporomandibular joint. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Dental School, 2002...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{several aspects}} {{related to the}} development of a reliable finite element model to simulate the craniofacial changes during rapid maxillary expansion treatment. The mechanical model concerns the entire human skull (bony structure and sutures) as well as the jackscrew device; the latter transforms the manual openings into orthodontic forces usually applied to the two maxillary halves through the first premolars and first permanent molars, which are the support points of the appliance. A sensitivity analysis of an approximate finite element model is performed in order to investigate the influence of the model size, the influence of the degree of sutural ossification by assigning different mechanical properties to the sutures and the influence of bone relaxation concerning the effects of <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedics.</b> Moreover, a more accurate model including the aforementioned teeth and their periodontal ligament as solid elastic structures was analysed in order to evaluate the orthodontic effects induced. Results refer to the opening pattern and associated stresses/displacements/strains on the cranium, the maxillae and the periodontal ligament. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} paediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is increased upper airway resistance during sleep presenting clinically as snoring. Paediatric SDB is a continuum ranging from primary snoring (PS), {{which is not}} associated with gas exchange abnormalities or significant sleep fragmentation, to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with complete upper airway obstruction, hypoxaemia, and obstructive hypoventilation.

40|$|The {{format of}} this current thesis is {{represented}} by 3 papers that have been accepted for publication by peer-reviewed orthodontic journals. Following is an outline and {{a summary of the}} 3 presented papers: Paper 1 : Paediatric sleep-disordered breathing due to upper airway obstruction in the orthodontic setting: a review. This is a narrative literature review of the topic. Accepted for publication in the Australian Orthodontic Journal. The essential feature of paediatric sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is increased upper airway resistance during sleep presenting clinically as snoring. Paediatric SDB is a continuum ranging from primary snoring (PS), which is not associated with gas exchange abnormalities or significant sleep fragmentation, to obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with complete upper airway obstruction, hypoxaemia, and obstructive hypoventilation. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity and craniofacial disharmonies are important predisposing factors in the development and progression of paediatric SDB. Clinical symptoms are manifold and domains affected include behaviour, neurocognition, cardiovascular morbidity and quality of life. Overnight polysomnography is the current diagnostic gold standard method to assess SDB severity while adenotonsillectomy is the recommended first line of treatment. Other treatments for managing paediatric SDB include nasal continuous airway pressure, the administration of nasal steroids, dentofacial orthopaedic treatment and surgery. However, there are insufficient long-term efficacy data using <b>dentofacial</b> <b>orthopaedics</b> to treat paediatric SDB. Further studies are warranted to define the characteristics of patients who might benefit most from orthodontic treatment. Paper 2 : Craniofacial and Upper Airway Morphology in Paediatric Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Published in the American Journal of Orthodontics and <b>Dentofacial</b> <b>Orthopaedics.</b> This study is a systematic review of the published literature with the results of the primary studies combined by meta-analyses in order to elucidate the nature of the association between craniofacial disharmony and paediatric SDB. Citations to potentially relevant published trials were located by searching Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Children with OSA and PS show an increased weighted mean difference (WMD) in ANB angle of 1. 64 ° (95 % CI 0. 88 – 2. 41, p < 0. 0001) and 1. 54 ° (95 % CI 0. 89 – 2. 20, p < 0. 00001), respectively in comparison to the controls. Increased ANB was primarily due to a decreased SNB angle in children with PS by 1. 4 ° (95 % CI - 2. 58 to - 0. 23, p = 0. 02). Children with OSA had a PNS–AD 1 distance reduced by 4. 17 mm (WMD) (95 % CI - 5. 85 to - 2. 50, p < 0. 00001) and a PNS–AD 2 distance reduced by 3. 12 mm (WMD) (95 % CI - 4. 56 to - 1. 67, p < 0. 0001) in comparison to the controls. There is statistical support for an association between craniofacial disharmony and paediatric SDB. However, an increased ANB angle of < 2 ° in children with OSA and PS, in comparison to the controls, could be regarded as of marginal significance. There is strong support of a reduced upper airway width in children in OSA as shown by reduced PNS–AD 1 and PNS–AD 2 distance. Paper 3 : Craniofacial and Upper Airway Morphology in Paediatric Sleep-disordered. Breathing and Changes in Quality of Life with Rapid Maxillary Expansion Accepted for publication in the American Journal of Orthodontics and <b>Dentofacial</b> <b>Orthopaedics.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of children at risk for SDB, as identified in an orthodontic setting by validated screening questionnaires, and to examine associations with presenting craniofacial and upper airway morphology. A further aim was to assess the change in the SDB-related quality of life (QoL) for affected children undergoing a rapid maxillary expansion (RME) to correct a palatal crossbite and/or widen a narrowed maxilla. 78 subjects were grouped as high risk (HR) or low risk (LR) for SDB based on the scores obtained by completing a validated 22 -item Paediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) and the OSA- 18 QoL questionnaire. Ten children who underwent RME were followed longitudinally until removal of the appliance (T 2) approximately 9 months later with a repeat OSA- 1 8 QoL questionnaire. All data were collected blinded to the questionnaire results. Children at high-risk for SDB are characterised by reduced SDB-related QoL, reduced nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sagittal dimensions, the presence of a palatal crossbite and reduced dentoalveolar transverse widths in the maxillary and mandibular arches. No sagittal or vertical craniofacial skeletal cephalometric predictors were identified for children at high-risk for SDB. In the short-term, RME might aid in improvement of SDB-related QoL for children with a narrow maxilla in the milder end of the SDB spectrum. Thesis (D. Clin. Dent.)

40|$|AIM: To analyse meta-analyses {{included}} in systematic reviews (SRs) published in leading orthodontic journals and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) focusing on orthodontic literature {{and to assess}} {{the quality of the}} existing evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic searching was undertaken to identify SRs published in five major orthodontic journals and the CDSR between January 2000 and June 2014. Quality assessment of the overall body of evidence from meta-analyses was conducted using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven SRs were identified; meta-analysis was present in 43 of these (27. 4 per cent). The highest proportion of SRs that included a meta-analysis was found in Orthodontics and Craniofacial Research (6 / 13; 46. 1 per cent), followed by the CDSR (12 / 33; 36. 4 per cent) and the American Journal of Orthodontics and <b>Dentofacial</b> <b>Orthopaedics</b> (15 / 44; 34. 1 per cent). Class II treatment was the most commonly addressed topic within SRs in orthodontics (n = 18 / 157; 11. 5 per cent). The number of trials combined to produce a summary estimate was small for most meta-analyses with a median of 4 (range: 2 - 52). Only 21 per cent (n = 9) of included meta-analyses were considered to have a high/moderate quality of evidence according to GRADE, while the majority were of low or very low quality (n = 34; 79. 0 per cent).

Foram selecionados nos periódicos American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics e The Angle Orthodontist (do ano de 1993 até 2002) todos os artigos onde foi avaliada a resistência de adesão de braquetes a diferentes superfícies, através de Máquinas de Ensaio Universal Instron ou similares. Foram analisados 127 artigos, e destes 86 % foram conduzidos através de ensaios de cisalhamento, ao passo que 14 % foram através de ensaios de tração. Dentre os estudos com dentes humanos (68 %), os pré-molares foram os mais utilizados (57 %), seguidos pelos molares (31 %). Quanto ao número de espécimes por grupo, 28 estudos analisaram entre 6 e 10; 30 entre 11 e 15; 33 entre 16 e 20; e 36 analisaram mais de 20 espécimes. Como solução de armazenamento, as mais empregadas foram: água destilada (43 %), seguido por Timol a 0, 1 % (28 %) e Cloreto de sódio a 0, 9 % (12 %). No que diz respeito à velocidade de operação da máquina, em 25 estudos foi de 0, 5 mm/min; em 43 foi de 1, 0 mm/min; em 8 foi de 2, 0 mm/min; e em 38 foi de 5, 0 mm/min.
