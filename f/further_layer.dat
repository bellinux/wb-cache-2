25|$|ROC and American {{authorities}} {{reached an}} agreement in 1958 to create the 35th Squadron, nicknamed the Black Cat Squadron, composed of two U-2Cs in Taoyuan Air Base in northern Taiwan, at an isolated part of the air base. To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created {{under the cover of}} high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents. But instead of being under normal USAF control, the project was known as Project Razor, and was run directly by the CIA with USAF assistance. Each of the 35th Squadron's operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand. A <b>further</b> <b>layer</b> of security and secrecy was enforced by all U.S. military and CIA/government personnel stationed in Taoyuan assigned to Detachment H having been issued official documents and IDs with false names and cover titles as Lockheed employees/representatives in civilian clothes.

2500|$|Cross's [...] "dual redaction" [...] {{model is}} {{probably}} the most widely accepted, but a considerable number of European scholars prefer an alternative model put forward by Rudolf Smend and his pupils. This approach holds that Noth was right to locate the composition of the history in the 6th century, but that further redactions took place after the initial composition, including a [...] "nomistic" [...] (from the Greek word for [...] "law"), or DtrN, layer, and a <b>further</b> <b>layer</b> concerned with the prophets and so called DtrP.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the Nights is {{extremely}} complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle {{the story of how}} the collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin summarises their findings: [...] "In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the Nights by Zotenberg and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the {{history of the}} text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from India and Persia. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title Alf Layla, or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of The Thousand and One Nights. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among them some tales about the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a <b>further</b> <b>layer</b> of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book’s title." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gregory's avowed aim {{in writing}} this book was to [...] "fire others with that enthusiasm by which the saints deservedly climbed to heaven", though this was not his sole purpose, and he most surely did not expect his entire {{audience}} to show promise of such piety as to witness the power of God flowing through them {{in the way that}} it did for the fathers. More immediate concerns were at the forefront of his mind as he sought to create a <b>further</b> <b>layer</b> of religious commitment, not only to the Church at Rome, but to local churches and cathedrals throughout Gaul. Along with his other books, notably the Glory of the Confessors, the Glory of the Martyrs and the Life of St. Martin, meticulous attention is paid to the local as opposed to the universal Christian experience. Within these grandiloquent lives are tales and anecdotes which tie miracles, saints and their relics to a great diversity of local areas, furnishing his audience with greater knowledge of their local shrine, and providing them with evidence of the work of God in their immediate vicinity, thus greatly expanding their connection with and understanding of their faith. Attacks on heresy also appear throughout his hagiographies, and Arianism is taken to be the common face of heresy across Europe, exposed to great ridicule. Often, the scenes which expose the weaknesses of heresy (Glory of the Martyrs, 79, 80) focus on images of fire and burning, whilst the Catholics are proved right by the protection lavished on them by God.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPalladium {{deposition}} on Pt(110) electrodes was studied. Differently from Pt(111) and Pt(100), {{first and}} <b>further</b> <b>layers</b> cannot be distinguished {{in this case}} only through the voltammetric behavior of hydrogen and anion adsorption. The potential of zero total charge (pztc) was determined {{as a function of}} the amount of deposited Pd using CO charge displacement experiments and voltammetric curves. The variation of the voltammetric charge due to hydrogen and anion adsorption has been followed during Pd deposition. The voltammetric charge between 0. 06 and 0. 4 V first decreases to a minimum, then increases and finally becomes stable, suggesting that the surface is finally covered with a Pd multilayer. The pztc and CO oxidation charge show similar behavior. CO oxidation, NO reduction and Cu UPD were used as probes to monitor Pd coverage. The potential of CO oxidation increases with Pd coverage while the potential of NO reduction decreases. Using the information obtained from Cu UDP and FTIR experiments it has been possible to determine when the first Pd single layer was completed and when a second (<b>further)</b> <b>layer(s)</b> starts to grow...|$|R
