40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} study of Suryoyo (Syrian Othodox) {{women living in}} Sweden. The main theme is {{the relation between the}} integration process in Swedish society and the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> cultural and religious background and ethnic identity. The core question posed is whether the women can be looked upon as "genuinely integrated" as participant subjects and citizens in the host society. A variety of qualitative methods are used: participation, observation, open interviews and narratives. Secondary analyses of available empirical material is also used. The narrative analysis is based on seven short life stories. Two separate cases are also presented: one - on the individual level - about a handicapped Suryoyo woman and the encounter with the immigrant receiving society and one - on the meso level - about the Suryoyo <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> effort to organize as a <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> <b>committee</b> in the Suryoyo Association. An overview of the religious and political history is a context presented which is of importance for understanding the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> situation in the Swedish exile. The conclusion is that the women are partly "pseudo intergrated" in a genuine political, structural and societal meaning. The obstacles to intergration are gender related but reasons are also {{to be found in the}} religious/cultural background, weakness in language and education and general segregating mechanisms in Swedish society. All these factors are mutually connected and make a complex background to the <b>women</b> 1 <b>s</b> integration process. At the same time the women have a platform in their strong ethnic identity and experiences as active subjects mirrored in their life stories. This platform is a tool of importance in the mobilizing process. A critical discussion on the grounded theory tradition in qualitative research is a second main theme in the study. It ends whith a reflection on methodological and ethical aspects connected to migration and ethnic research...|$|R
25|$|Some Dutch {{physical}} features like auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are {{a consequence of}} this episode when <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> became concubines of the Chinese commanders. The Chinese took <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reportedly still living, in Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted and an arrangement to release the prisoners was proposed by a son of Koxinga but it came to nothing. The Chinese officers used the <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> who they received as concubines. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> were used for sexual pleasure by Koxinga's commanders. This event in which <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> were distributed to the Chinese soldiers and commanders was recorded in the daily journal of the fort.|$|R
40|$|The present article looks how {{intimate}} liaisons between <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> and Balinese men {{are intertwined}} in complex and sometimes paradoxical ways {{in regard to}} class position, gender ideologies and immigration policy in the contemporary Netherlands. Central to this analysis is a dialogue between <b>Dutch</b> <b>women,</b> their Balinese partners and popular discourse about <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> who marry ‘the other men’. I examine how citizenship regulations that {{play a significant role}} in interfamilial relations of interdependency form complex gender dynamics, and how <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s rhetoric about the emancipation of <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> and desire for a companionate marriage tend to collide with the practices of everyday life. I argue that gender ideologies in these cross-cultural liaisons are conceptualised and reconceptualised in relation to ‘gender imaginings’. I suggest that the ideals of companionate marriage, favoured by <b>Dutch</b> <b>women,</b> are linked directly to ideals of modernity and individualism, in which particular scripts of gender relations are used to differentiate progressive individuals from those who are not...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia {{in which}} Chinese Ming loyalist forces {{commanded}} by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek, {{two of his}} daughters, {{and his wife were}} among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation, and in addition to this, a rumor was spreading among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children also being killed. The surviving <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine, and <b>Dutch</b> <b>women</b> were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives, the daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that [...] "the best were preserved {{for the use of the}} commanders, and then sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands." [...] In 1684 some of these Dutch wives were still captives of the Chinese.
