40|$|Vehicle {{bodies are}} {{designed}} and manufactured {{to provide the}} occupants with an adequate level of protection by maintaining {{the integrity of the}} passenger compartment, and assuring, at the same time, that the crash deceleration pulse stays below the biomechanical limits of the human tolerance. Therefore, the target of crashworthiness studies is an optimised vehicle structure with controlled deformation zones in order to maintain sufficient space inside the passenger cell. In particular, during a side crash, mainly the cross beam structures of the passenger compartment and also the high-strength beaded <b>floor</b> <b>sheet</b> plates can be utilised for supporting and energy absorption. This paper presents the improvement of lateral vehicle crashworthiness achieved by implementing a tube oriented design. A ring-shaped component, which is basically a circular cross-section extruded profile supporting the B-pillars, roof and floor, is designed and implemented in a numerical model of a typical sedan shaped vehicle. The numerical assessment of the proposed solution is performed according to the "Euro NCAP Side Impact Testing Protocol" using LS-Dyna explicit code and Madymo for occupant simulations. Comparative results are presented in terms of intrusions into the passenger cell and loads on the occupant dummy EuroSID- 2. Relevant injury criteria are analysed and processed into the side impact score specified by the "Euro NCAP Assessment Protocol". Furthermore, particular importance has to be attributed to weight reduction during the development phase because of the significant contribution of vehicle mass to driving resistance and emissions. Hence, lightweight materials are also implemented for the ring structure. The results obtained from the side impact simulations of the new developed solution are compared to the ones with the steel ring componen...|$|E

40|$|Eight {{groups of}} mafic dikes and related {{high-level}} stocks cut Triassic accretionary complex and Mesozoic magmatic arc formations on Livingston Island. Some {{are affected by}} silicic/sericitic alteration, related to Cretaceous hydrothermal activity, and propylitic/epidosite alteration, analogous to that in ocean <b>floor</b> <b>sheeted</b> dikes. Alteration was accompanied by major and trace element metasomatism. Ar-Ar analysis of the freshest rocks indicates five intrusive events, {{some of which are}} unexpectedly young. Groups 1 – 3 were intruded in the mid to late Cretaceous (∼ 108 – 74 Ma) and were coeval with the calc-alkaline arc. Between 70 and 50 Ma, relatively rapid and oblique plate convergence led to strike-slip tectonism and a pause in magmatism. At ∼ 52 Ma, orthogonal, slow convergence resulted in extensional faulting and emplacement of calc-alkaline (group 2) and primitive tholeiitic dikes (groups 4 – 6) between 51 and 45 Ma. Extension of Antarctic Peninsula-southern South American crust culminated in emplacement of mafic to intermediate, medium-grained plutons and group C porphyries between 44 and 36 Ma. Localized hydrothermal flow along fault zones resulted in partial to complete argon loss from nearby Cretaceous lavas and Ar-Ar reset ages of ∼ 40 Ma in mid-Cretaceous hydrothermal K-feldspar. Primitive olivine basalts (group D) and epithermal carbonate veins (31 – 29 Ma) were emplaced during along-arc extension accompanying the opening of Drake Passage and Powell Basin. Excess argon occurs in two forms: strongly held in melt? inclusions in the primitive tholeiites and weakly held in some secondary alteration. There is no radiometric evidence, in the area studied, for magmatism related to late Cenozoic subduction, nor to the Pleistocene-Recent opening of the back arc Bransfield rift...|$|R
