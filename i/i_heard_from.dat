25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
500|$|Her eighteenth studio {{release was}} 1994's Read My Mind. The album spawned five major hit singles onto the Billboard Country chart, {{including}} the No. 1 single [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter". The further releases ("Till You Love Me", [...] "Why Haven't <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>from</b> You", and [...] "And Still") became Top 10 singles {{on the same}} chart, with [...] "Till You Love Me" [...] also reaching No. 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, a chart {{that she had not}} previously entered. The album itself reached No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Charlotte Dillon of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, calling it [...] "another wonderful offering of songs performed by the gifted country singer Reba McEntire". Dillon also felt that the album's material had [...] "a little soul, a little swing, and some pop, too".|$|E
500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E

500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

[...] the ruling being followed by the signature [...] "Solomon b. Isaac", without any concluding formula (Mahzor Vitry, pp.434–435).|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E
