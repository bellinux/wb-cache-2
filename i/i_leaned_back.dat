25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entr√©e that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{against the wall}} on my inside banquette {{and looked at him}} in frank astonishment.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my non-rotary {{revolving}} {{chair and}} nodded gently, like a mandarin, at my paste-pot.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{my chair}} with my mind at ease {{for the first time}} since the receipt of my son's letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to play to-day," [...] she said, [...] "and I'm not going to tell a single story. Aunt Janet won't let me put pebbles in my shoes, but I've put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> the least bit. And I'm going to work buttonholes all over this cotton. I hate working buttonholes worse than {{anything}} in the world, so I'm going to work them all day." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} long silence {{and it seemed}} to me that Mr. Marx was very deep in thought. I was {{beginning}} to feel sleepy and, closing my eyes, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> right <b>back</b> among the soft, yielding cushions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know what I have come to say," [...] he said, {{standing}} before me, as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> gracefully <b>back</b> in a big chair, having taken care that the folds of my dress fell just as they should.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] I answered, on {{the sudden}} impulse, [...] "I am an escaped French prisoner." [...] And with that, having tossed my cap over the mills (as they say), <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in the settee, and we {{regarded}} each other.|$|E
60|$|Decresson and his {{companion}} exchanged glances. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my chair. The {{three of them}} talked together earnestly for several minutes in an undertone. Then Louis, with a little sigh of relief, {{rose to his feet}} and came over to my side.|$|E
60|$|The {{stiffness}} {{had gone}} from my brain and fingers. My pen flew over the paper. The joy of creation sang once more in my heart, tingled in all my pulses. We worked together and in silence {{for an hour or}} more. Then, with a little sigh of satisfaction, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my chair.|$|E
60|$|O waly, waly, up the bank, O waly, waly, {{down the}} brae. And waly, waly, yon burn side, Where I and my love wont to gae. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my <b>back</b> unto an aik, An' thocht {{it was a}} trustie tree, But first it bow'd and syne it brak, Sae my true love did lichtly me.|$|R
60|$|The mizzen is in {{and fast}} furled. In the night, {{what of the}} roll {{and the absence of}} wind, it had made life too hideous to be {{permitted}} to go on rasping at the mast, smashing at the tackles, and buffeting the empty air into hollow outbursts of sound. But the big mainsail is still on, and the staysail, jib, and flying-jib are snapping and slashing at their sheets with every roll. Every star is out. Just for luck I put the wheel hard over in the opposite direction to which it had been left by Hermann, and <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and gaze up at the stars. There is nothing else for me to do. There is nothing to be done with a sailing vessel rolling in a stark calm.|$|R
5000|$|Claypool stated [...] "Song-wise <b>I</b> think Brown <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> to Suck... or 1990's Frizzle Fry". [...] "It's a {{far more}} {{aggressive}} album than we've done in a long time. The differences between this album and Punch Bowl... are far greater than the differences between this album and the very early stuff." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{fastened}} the car door, {{climbed to}} his own seat outside, and we set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so {{near the end of}} my journey; and as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{development}} {{worthy of}} Darwin!", the lady exclaimed enthusiastically. [...] "Only you reverse his theory. Instead {{of developing a}} mouse into an elephant, you would develop an elephant into a mouse!" [...] But here we plunged into a tunnel, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{and closed my eyes}} for a moment, trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "--and sweet," [...] Arthur went on, [...] "and pure, and self-denying, and true-hearted, and--" [...] {{he broke}} off hastily, {{as if he could}} not trust himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious. Silence followed: and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with bright and {{beautiful}} imaginings of Arthur and his lady-love, and of all the peace and happiness in store for them.|$|E
60|$|Thinking {{to attract}} {{attention}} from inside the craft, I again ran down the ladder and onto the small deck {{only to find that}} the steel covers of the conning-tower windows were shut, and then <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> with my <b>back</b> against the tower and cursed myself for a gullible idiot.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{gazed at}} me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He {{staggered}} back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my <b>back</b> against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.|$|R
60|$|We rowed out {{on to the}} Firth, or, to be more {{strictly}} correct, the two Grantons rowed while Charles and <b>I</b> sat and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in {{the stern}} on the luxurious cushions. They rowed fast and well. In a very few minutes they had rounded the point and got clear {{out of sight of}} the Cockneyfied towers and false battlements of Seldon.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> almost exhausted. Incredible as it {{may seem}} to you, in spite of that awful photograph, I couldn't really believe even so I had killed my father. And yet I knew very well now that Jack, at least, hadn't done it. That was almost enough. But not quite. My head swam round in terror. I waited and longed for Jack to explain the whole thing to me.|$|E
60|$|It was a wet {{night and}} the streets seemed like a perfect sea of umbrellas. The rain was coming down in sheets, beating against the closed glass front of our cab and dimming its surface, until it became {{impossible}} to see farther than the horse's head. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> by Mr. Marx's side with a sigh, and found {{that he had been}} watching me with an amused smile.|$|E
60|$|We {{came to the}} end of the stage, {{and still}} the lost trace was not recovered. I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change, but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood {{watching}} the ostlers that he had heard nothing. Almost in an instant afterwards, as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my seat, he looked in, with his lighted lantern in his hand, an excited and quite different man.|$|E
60|$|It seemed such an {{extraordinary}} {{thing to have}} Dora always there. It was so unaccountable not to be obliged {{to go out to}} see her, not to have any occasion to be tormenting myself about her, not to have to write to her, not to be scheming and devising opportunities of being alone with her. Sometimes of an evening, when I looked up from my writing, and saw her seated opposite, <b>I</b> would <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> in my chair, and think how queer it was that there we were, alone together as a matter of course--nobody's business any more--all the romance of our engagement put away upon a shelf, to rust--no one to please but one another--one another to please, for life.|$|R
60|$|He {{made his}} way along the terrace, leaning heavily upon his stick, and sank with a little sigh of relief {{into one of the}} cushion-laden wicker chairs. <b>I</b> watched him <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> with half-closed eyes; and I {{realized}} then what an effort this walk must have been to him. Before me the great front doors stood open, and with the familiarity of close neighborship, I passed into the cool shaded hall, with its palms and flowers, its billiard-table invitingly uncovered, its tiny fountain playing in its marble basin. There was no one in sight; but, stretched upon a bright crimson cushion, set back in the heart of a great easy-chair, was a small Japanese spaniel.|$|R
6000|$|... "At Holyhead I {{tried to}} get into a {{carriage}} with people that looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn't want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. <b>I</b> had <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep, but my eyes weren't quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....|$|R
60|$|The porter {{came and}} brushed the {{collection}} of soot on the window-sill {{off to the left}} knee of my trousers. I removed it with an air of apology. The temperature was eighty-eight. One of the dotted-veiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators, and spoke loudly of Interlaken. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> idly in chair No. 7, and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small, black, bald-spotted head just visible above the back of No. 9.|$|E
60|$|Pursuing my idea as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my wooden chair, {{and looked}} at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an {{extraordinary}} girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally accomplished {{in the terms of}} our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better.|$|E
60|$|The tea {{was going}} on pleasantly {{when one of the}} babies began to cry. Teenie bent over it crooning gruffly. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> and looked out of the door to watch her. I thought of the girl in Tchekoff's story, who smothered her charge, and I hoped the grim Teenie would not be driven to such desperation. The other child joined in this chorus. Teenie rose from her seat and walked about the yard, gruffly trying to soothe the twins.|$|E
6000|$|... "These men {{are up to}} no good," [...] Hector {{whispered to}} Paolo as they {{sat down on a}} bench at a table some little {{distance}} from that at which the other men were seated. [...] "I am sorry now that I asked for the liquor, it was necessary to order something. I should not be surprised if they drug it. Do you put yours to your lips, and then groan as if it hurt you too much to try to swallow, and leave it standing in front of you. I will pretend to drink mine, and will manage to pour it away on the floor. Presently do you lean forward on to the table and appear to fall asleep. As I am in the corner, <b>I</b> will <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and seem to go off also. Unless I am greatly mistaken this is a regular thieves' den. Keep one hand on the butt of a pistol. We will both keep awake for a time, and if nothing comes of it we will then watch by turns. It is clear that they suspect that we are not what we seem." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{considerate}} {{kindness of}} the Angel mollified me in no little measure; and, {{aided by the}} water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper {{to listen to his}} very extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned from what {{he said that he was}} the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great length, while <b>I</b> merely <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the room. But, by-and-by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, [...] "beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens." ...|$|R
60|$|It has dawned upon me that I {{have never}} placed a proper {{valuation}} upon womankind. For that matter, though not amative to any considerable degree {{so far as}} I have discovered, I was never outside the atmosphere of women until now. My mother and sisters were always about me, and I {{was always trying to}} escape them; for they worried me to distraction with their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den, when my orderly confusion, upon which I prided myself, was turned into worse confusion and less order, though it looked neat enough to the eye. I never could find anything when they had departed. But now, alas, how welcome would have been the feel of their presence, the frou-frou and swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested! I am sure, if I ever get home, that I shall never be irritable with them again. They may dose me and doctor me morning, noon, and night, and dust and sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day, and <b>I</b> shall only <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed of a mother and some several sisters.|$|R
60|$|I thought I {{would watch}} for the Count's return, {{and for a long}} time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks {{floating}} in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.|$|E
60|$|Depressed as I was by what I {{had just}} {{witnessed}} on deck, there came to me, as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> {{in my chair}} and opened the second volume of George Moore's Hail and Farewell, a premonition that the voyage was to be disastrous. But then, as I looked about the room, measured its generous space, realized that I was more comfortably situated than I had ever been on any passenger steamer, I dismissed foreboding thoughts and caught a pleasant vision of myself, through weeks and months, catching {{up with all the}} necessary reading which I had so long neglected.|$|E
6000|$|The driver {{touched his}} horses, {{and we started}} briskly off again. But I confess I had quite enough of his pessimism, and as we drove away <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> toward the Altrurian and said: [...] "Now, it is all perfect {{nonsense}} to pretend that things are at that pass with us. There are more millionaires in America, probably, than there are in all the other civilized countries of the globe, {{and it is not}} possible that the farming population should be in such a hopeless condition. All wealth comes out of the earth, and you may be sure they get their full share of it." ...|$|E

60|$|Draconmeyer gave an {{instruction}} to his chauffeur and <b>leaned</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
