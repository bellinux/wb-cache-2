Though based on the original game of the same name, it is a distinct game, with <b>different</b> <b>level</b> designs and a different plot, and this version, unlike the 16-bit release, {{does not have the}} spin dash, which led it to being thought to be made before the Sega Genesis version.|$|E
5|$|Wilber's {{interpretation}} of Aurobindo's philosophy {{differed from the}} notion of dividing reality as a <b>different</b> <b>level</b> of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in The Life Divine, and terms them as higher- or lower-nested holons and states {{that there is only}} a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a <b>different</b> <b>level</b> it must be renamed.|$|E

Within these two eco-regions are five level four eco-regions: the Western Cascade Mountain Highlands, Cascade Crest Montane Forest, and Cascades Subalpine/Alpine within the Cascades eco-region and the Yakima Plateau and Slopes and Grand Fir Mixed Forest within the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Adams is unique among the Washington volcanoes {{in that it is}} in two level three eco-regions as well as being the only one within the Cascade Crest Montane Forest.|$|E

Some {{of the effects}} created by Lazur would rely on software programming rather than the Nintendo 64 hardware, as the latter would not be capable of rendering them directly. The second mode would be a full 3D mode played in either regular or high display resolution, and would feature <b>different</b> <b>level</b> of detail textures depending on camera distances, to maximize clarity and performance. Both modes {{would be in a}} top-down perspective, although more cinematic camera angles, similar to those from , were also considered for the 3D mode.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a <b>different</b> <b>level</b> of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the second}} chapter of Genesis, Eve was created by God (Yahweh) by taking her from the rib of Adam, to be Adam's companion. She succumbs to the serpent's temptation to eat the {{forbidden}} fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. She shares the fruit with Adam, {{and as a result}} the first humans are expelled from the Garden of Eden. Christian churches differ on how they view both Adam and Eve's disobedience to God (often called the fall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of humanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam (the first man) and Eve to a <b>different</b> <b>level</b> of responsibility for the fall, although Islamic teaching holds both equally responsible.|$|E
25|$|Vertical glass tubes, {{known as}} water gauges or water glasses, show {{the level of}} water in the boiler and are {{carefully}} monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a <b>different</b> <b>level.</b> By opening each try-cock and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level {{of water in the}} boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings. This led to their replacement with the sight glass. As with the injectors, two glasses with separate fittings were usually installed to provide independent readings.|$|E
25|$|The game uses several <b>different</b> <b>level</b> {{types and}} layouts. The game starts {{out in a}} front yard, and {{progresses}} to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come up on a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.|$|E
