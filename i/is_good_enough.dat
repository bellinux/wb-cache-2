5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for me.|$|E
5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee. She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E

500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E

500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E

In The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan ranking of the fifty best episodes of 2002, it was placed 17th. David Bianculli, a writer for New York Daily News, said the pilot [...] "not only establishes the character of Monk, it establishes the perfect tone for the show, a delicate but deft blend of wry humor and tender drama." [...] United Feature Syndicate's critic Kevin McDonough praised the [...] "whimsical" [...] direction, and added [...] "Monk is not easy to love, but shines as a funny and fresh alternative to summer reruns." [...] It was also called [...] "fresh and funny" [...] by Entertainment Weeklys Bruce Fretts, and a [...] "invigorating" [...] "fresh spring breeze {{in the middle of}} summer" [...] by The Washington Posts Tom Shales. Varietys Phil Gallo praised the [...] "breezy gait of the storytelling, the nicely explained quirks of a brilliant mind and Tony Shalhoub's sterling characterization" [...] in his review. Tom Gliatto, a Peoples critic, declared [...] "This is probably not a clinically accurate portrayal of an OCD sufferer, but Shalhoub's gentle earnestness keeps it from being gimmicky." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman praised how OCD was used [...] "creatively from humor to sadness." [...] Chris Hicks of Deseret News declared, [...] "this pilot episode <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to be a theatrical film; in fact, it's better than most features — funny, warm, character-driven and loaded with hilarious vignettes." ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Vibe magazine's Jason King {{said that}} the album {{occasionally}} [...] "sounds desperate to reach every demographic". Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective [...] "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it [...] "a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads [...] "self-pitying/self-mythologising", while Q stated, [...] "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it [...] "demonstrates vocal finesse [...] But, especially on the ballads, [...] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardians Adam Sweeting wrote that [...] "the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad {{means that there is}} barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, [...] "Dangerously in Love ... with her daddy, the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." [...] He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that [...] "the first half <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny".|$|E
