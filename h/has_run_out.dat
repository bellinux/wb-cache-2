25|$|White {{has a few}} pawn moves {{which do}} not lose material, but {{eventually}} {{he will have to}} move one of his pieces. If he plays 1.Rc1 or Rd1, then 1...Re2 traps White's queen; 1.Kh2 fails to 1...R5f3, also trapping the queen, since White cannot play 2.Bxf3 because the bishop is pinned to the king; 1.g4 runs into 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3?

Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub, scolding them for ignoring him. Homer decides {{to make up for}} their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics.

500|$|Dark Angel is a single-player beat 'em up {{game played}} {{from a third}} person view. Players take control of Max Guevara, a genetically-enhanced super soldier. [...] Levels involve {{fighting}} enemies while following a fairly straightforward path to the level's exit. Max attacks enemies using various punches, kicks and throws, and can also utilize the environment to perform actions, such as kickflipping off a wall then attacking an enemy from behind. She can also perform moves like back flips and side twirls to evade enemies. Occasionally Max may have {{to interact with the}} environment to advance past a point, such as placing an explosive on a door, though what is required to progress through the level is clearly highlighted to the player. Max receives communications from Logan Cale, who offers his advice on how she may reach objectives. The game also presents 'stealth mode' sequences during some levels. In stealth mode, Max can distract enemies by making noise or perform stealth kills by sneaking up on them. If Max is spotted during stealth mode, a timer is activated and additional enemies begin to appear. If she has not reached the exit or killed the enemies when the timer <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> the level must be restarted. Boss enemies are present in some levels.|$|E

500|$|Caligari, like {{a number}} of Weimar films that {{followed}} it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist. Kracauer said Dr. Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character [...] "stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values". Likewise, John D. Barlow described Dr. Caligari {{as an example of}} the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the [...] "common man of unconditional obedience". Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Dr. Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war. The control Dr. Caligari yields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion. Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, [...] "like a machine that <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of fuel".|$|E
500|$|The three cannot {{return to}} the present right away since the [...] "return pad" [...] to Stewie's time machine fails to activate. [...] They decide to go to England where Mort, who is Jewish, will be safe from the Nazis. While {{attempting}} to cross the border, German officers find out that Mort is Jewish (while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest), resulting in their being chased by the Nazis. [...] Mort, Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a motorbike, followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U-boat. The chase scene on the motorbike re-enacts the skateboard chase scene in Back To The Future. [...] Like Biff, the Nazi officers' car ends up slamming into a manure truck ("Das Poop!"). [...] The three make it to England safely, and see Winston Churchill. Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> uranium fuel. [...] Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a [...] "secret" [...] nuclear testing facility in Berlin, Nazi Germany. The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me-109 fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding the nuclear research lab, Stewie disguises himself as Adolf Hitler, while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line).|$|E
500|$|The core {{gameplay}} remains unchanged {{from the}} other games in the series. [...] The Guitar Grip is required {{to play the game}} and comes as part of a bundle that can be purchased for each installment. The Grip is designed for the DS Lite, but features a small adapter that can be removed for use in the older Nintendo DS models. Four fret buttons are located {{on the side of the}} unit near the cartridge slot. This is one less than the normal five frets, included an orange-colored one, managed by other Guitar Hero controllers. [...] A wriststrap is attached to the underside to provide support while playing. The player holds the unit in a vertical book orientation (similar to [...] or [...] ), and uses a special guitar pick-shaped stylus to strum on the touchscreen of the DS with their free hand. The [...] "note highway" [...] and the performance of the chosen character in the band are shown on the opposite screen. [...] As notes scroll down on the note highway, the player must press the correct fret button and strum the touchscreen at the same time to successfully score points. While holding a long note, the player can also use the touch screen to apply a whammy effect by moving the stylus across the on-screen whammy bar or anywhere on the screen. [...] After the player has successfully hit a selected series of notes, he or she will gain [...] "Star Power" [...] which doubles their score until the meter <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>out.</b> This is activated by yelling or blowing into the DS's microphone, by pressing any of the face buttons on the DS, or by tapping the Star Power meter on the touchscreen.|$|E
