25|$|District heating in Vienna {{is run by}} Wien Energie. In the {{business}} year of 2004/2005 a total of 5.163GWh was sold, 1.602GWh to 251.224 private apartments and houses and 3.561GWh to 5211 major customers. The three large municipal waste incinerators provide 22% of the total in producing 116GWh electric power and 1.220GWh heat. Waste heat from municipal power plants and large industrial plants account for 72% of the total. The remaining 6% is produced by peak <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> from fossil fuel. A biomass-fired power plant has produced heat since 2006.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, oil <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> {{took over}} from coal burners along the Eastern Seaboard; diesel {{locomotives}} took over from coal-fired steam engines under dieselisation; oil-fired electricity plants were built; petroleum-burning buses replaced electric streetcars in a GM driven conspiracy, {{for which they}} were found guilty, and citizens bought gasoline powered cars. Interstate Highways helped make cars the major means of personal transportation. As oil imports increased, US foreign policy was inexorably drawn into Middle East politics, supporting oil-producing Saudi Arabia and patrolling the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|Monmouth College {{has reduced}} its energy {{consumption}} and has substantially increased its recycling contributions in recent years. These efforts include energy reduction through {{the installation of}} numerous new <b>heating</b> <b>boilers</b> throughout campus, the use of energy efficient lighting, low-flow water systems and the replacement of windows in nearly all older buildings. The new Center for Science and Business includes energy efficient heating/cooling systems and heat recapture exhaust systems among many other features. Recycling efforts now extend into every student residence and office building. Some students have also committed themselves to sustainability of food production by opting {{to live in the}} college’s Garden theme housing which grows its own organic food and harvests its own honey using college facilities including seven acres set aside for such use. The college also provides scholarships for students who have demonstrated leadership in sustainability prior to enrolling.|$|E
50|$|Some {{experts that}} work with boilers {{on a day-to-day basis}} feel that {{electric}} boilers are actually superior to fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boilers</b> in a few ways. Those experts say that using electric boilers may actually be cheaper than using a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler,</b> while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The electric boilers also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler.</b> Electric Boilers can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler</b> requires to operate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> is an {{important}} part of waste heat power station in cement plant. So it is highly important to control the drum level of waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> within the allowed range. A double-stage fuzzy controller which is used to control the drum level of the waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> is presented in this paper. This method adds a secondary fuzzy controller to adjust the weight of the first fuzzy controller’s factor on the basis of a general fuzzy controller. Simulation results show that the double-stage fuzzy control system has fast respond speed, high precision and strong anti-jamming capability...|$|R

[...] Some were fitted with ETH and became 47/4s, whilst the others remained with no train heating capability and were therefore used mainly on freight work. [...] In the 1990s, the class designation 47/2 was applied to some class 47/0s and class 47/3s after they were fitted with multiple working equipment. [...] The locomotives involved also had their vacuum braking systems removed or isolated, leaving them air braked only. This was mainly a paper exercise, however, and the locomotives were not renumbered; in this article they are included in Class 47/0.|$|E
