50|$|By 1938 the Gaiety Theatre was {{in need of}} refurbishment. However, {{the theatre}} no longer {{conformed}} to the then current licensing regulations, and so extensive modernisation was required. This was not considered to be financially viable and in 1939 the Gaiety Theatre closed. The interior <b>fittings</b> were <b>stripped</b> from the building, and sold at auction. Standing empty during World War II, the building suffered further damage as a result of bombing during air raids.|$|R
50|$|BIX {{connectors}} are rectangular punch-down blocks used {{to terminate}} up to 25 pairs. The connecters have a slip-in <b>fitting</b> which automatically <b>strips</b> the wire {{as it is}} punched down, {{eliminating the need for}} pre-stripping. BIX connectors also have a pair-splitter to facilitate fast arranging of wires on the punch-down block.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{take-off}} performance of {{a model of the}} hull of a typical flying boat, Navy PH- 1, of <b>fitting</b> spray <b>strips</b> of four different widths, each at three different angles, was determined by model tests in the NACA Tank. Spray strips of widths up to 3 percent of the beam improve the general performance at speeds near the hump and reduce the spray thrown. A downward angle of 30 degrees to 45 degrees in the neighborhood of the step seems most favorable for the reduction of the spray. The spray strips have a large effect in reducing the trimming moments at speeds near the hump speed, but have little {{effect on the}}m at high speeds...|$|R
25|$|On {{the death}} of Ralph II in 1862, Ralph III (1827 – 10 November 1891) took over the running of Ralph Heaton & Sons. He added eleven lever presses, made on site, {{retiring}} the last of Boulton's screw presses in 1882. In addition {{to the production of}} coins and blanks the firm manufactured metal parts for ammunition, gas fittings, medals, ornaments, plumbing <b>fittings,</b> rolled and <b>strip</b> metal, tube and wire.|$|R
40|$|A robust {{technique}} with a sub-optimal {{weight function}} (M-estimate) {{was applied to}} investigate track <b>fitting</b> in cathode <b>strip</b> chambers (CSCs) and determine the CSC spatial resolution. The comparative analysis with the conventional least squares method was made on simulated data and experimental data from the Dubna CSC prototype. The results obtained definitely prove a necessity of using robust track fitting for a reliable estimation of muon chamber spatial resolution. (10 refs) ...|$|R

500|$|The castle {{declined}} once again, {{the courtroom}} became unsafe {{to use and}} [...] by 1833, the remaining judicial <b>fittings</b> had been <b>stripped</b> out. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century the Duchy of Cornwall rejected proposals to repair the castle in order to bring it back into service as being too expensive, but the castle site was enclosed to prevent injuries to children who might be tempted to play on the stonework. By the 1870s, the town of Lydford was vastly reduced in importance from the medieval period and the castle's roofs and floors had either collapsed or been removed.|$|R
50|$|The Lucy Lavers {{served at}} Aldeburgh for 19 years, {{during which she}} and her crew {{undertook}} 30 operations which saved 7 lives. During her service in the RNLI’s reserve fleet at Wells-next-the-Sea, Sheringham, and Rhyl, she undertook a further 52 missions, saving 37 lives. In 1968 she was finally sold out of the fleet by the RNLI and began {{a career as a}} pilot boat in the port of Saint Helier, Jersey. She was also renamed L’esperance and eventually became a private fishing boat. In 1986 the lifeboat was given a new role when she was bought by a Dive and Ski Club of St. Helier. During this period she spend most of her time around the island of Sark. In 1997 she was finally retired and her engine canopy and some of her remaining fixtures and <b>fittings</b> were <b>stripped</b> out and used in the restoration of , an ex-Saint Helier lifeboat. Following the removal of these parts her diagonal mahogany hull, which was still in good condition, and she was sent to Simon Evans Boat Yard on the River Yonne, in Sens, France. She was then joined the Dunkirk Little Ships Restoration Trust.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} pumped out and raised on 9 June, {{and taken to}} the naval drydock at Pearl Harbor for {{inspection}} on 12 June. While remaining in Hawaii, one engine was restored to working order and the ship departed for Los Angeles under her own power on 30October. After her arrival, further inspections were conducted, and {{it was determined that}} repairs would be too expensive, especially given the global economic conditions. City of Honolulu was declared a total loss, and was laid up in the West Basin of Los Angeles Harbor for almost three years. During her lay up, <b>fittings</b> and fixtures <b>stripped</b> from the vessel were auctioned in July 1932, and in December, film crews from Columbia Pictures Corporation spent ten days filming on board the ship.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a line to Alton via the Meon Valley, {{branching}} from the Eastleigh route at Knowle, north of the tunnel. It was built initially as a fast route to the Isle of Wight - to express standards though only a single line on double track earthworks - {{at a time when}} Stokes Bay, not Portsmouth Harbour, was the primary rail-connected ferry terminus for the Island. That route closed to passengers in 1955.In the early 21st century a new footbridge and lifts were erected {{to the north of the}} station buildings and canopies. The lifts allows the station to comply with the Equality Act 2010, providing wheelchair access to all platforms. Related work has included <b>fitting</b> tactile <b>strips</b> to all three platforms. Work commenced in October 2008 and was undertaken by Osborne Rail Division. The ticket office was reopened with a new entrance to the platform at the south end of the corridor. Ticket barriers were also installed and a new station shop constructed at the end of the station building on Platform 3. Work to replace & renew nine sets of points & 240 metres of track at the station in October 2016 has seen all services here replaced by buses (between Eastleigh & Swanwick and Portsmouth Harbour) for nine days (22-30 October inclusive).|$|R
50|$|Half page is a Sunday strip {{format that}} is roughly 10 inches high and 14 inches wide. Today, {{it is the}} largest and most {{complete}} format for most Sunday strips, including Peanuts, Prince Valiant, and Doonesbury. The half-page Sunday strip was introduced in the 1920s to fit two Sunday strips on a single page. The Phantom, Mandrake the Magician and Terry and the Pirates were introduced in this format. Other strips, such as Flash Gordon and Blondie had panels rearranged, cropped or removed to make the full page fit in a smaller size. In the 1940s, most newspapers wanted more comics per page, so they often reduced the size. Beginning about this time, the half page became the standard size, and the third-of-a-page <b>strip</b> was introduced, <b>fitting</b> three <b>strips</b> on each page, one above another. A half page typically had three tiers; the third page either reduced, rearranged and cropped these panels, as seen in Li'l Abner strips, or more commonly, just dropped the top tier, {{as was the case with}} Peanuts. Most newspaper readers did not realize there were only seeing part of what the artist drew, and the artists were forced into increasingly restrictive formats to make dropping panels possible. Today, only the Reading Eagle and a few other newspapers run any of their Sunday strips in the complete half-page format. The Sunday Calvin and Hobbes comic strip was so popular that the artist insisted that it fill half of a page, although many editors ran a shrunken version of the same strip. That strip has since ended, and today the only strip that requires the half-page format, though not necessarily the half-page size, is Opus.|$|R
2500|$|An {{appeal was}} made to the Grand Fleet for volunteers for special service on 23 February 1918. Very few of the {{participants}} were aware of the objective. The cruisers involved in the blockade, including [...] were equipped in Chatham by over [...] for the special <b>fitting</b> out or <b>stripping</b> out (in the case of the ships to be sunk) of unnecessary equipment, including their masts. Iris, Daffodil and the submarines were converted in Portsmouth. The fleet made its rendezvous at Swin Deep, about [...] south of Clacton. The first opportunity for the raid was early April 1918 and on 2 April the fleet sailed and Zeebrugge was bombed by 65 Squadron from Dunkirk. The success of the raid depended upon smokescreens to protect the British ships from the fire of German coastal artillery but the wind direction was unfavourable and the attack was called off. Zeebrugge was visible to the fleet and the fleet to the Germans in Zeebrugge; seventy-seven ships of all sizes, some with their lights already switched off, had to make a sharp turn to the west to return to their bases.|$|R
40|$|A {{review was}} {{undertaken}} {{to obtain information}} on the range of claw abrasives {{which could be used}} in layer cages to keep claws of hens blunt. In Europe a council directive has been issued which requires that all layer cages be fitted with suitable claw shortening devices. Research in Europe on claw abrasives suggest that abrasives reduce claw length of hens, improves feather cover, lowers mortality and reduces the incidence of scratches and entrapment injuries. More recent trials in Australia showed that claw abrasives could result in mortality in hens from prolapse and cannibalism. A low-cost, non-invasive method by which the claws of caged layers can be kept short and blunt can be achieved by <b>fitting</b> 8 mm <b>strips</b> of abrasive tape on the egg guard. Bird`s claws scrape against this tape while they are feeding. In Australia studies have shown that abrasive paint was more effective and more durable as a claw shortener than abrasive strips. The birds using the abrasive paint had the shortest claw length and lowest claw sharpness. Other work in Europe has shown that strips of sand fixed on the egg baffle with resin had a significant abrasive effect on the nails {{but by the end of}} the laying period large parts of the strip had been worn down. Claw shorteners have also been produced during cage manufacture by pressing a tread to make a perforated baffle. One of the most durable claw abrasives is a metal plate with abrasive iron filings. Other durable abrasives such as stone are also being tested for suitability as a claw abrasive...|$|R
