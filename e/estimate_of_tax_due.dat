Amongst many other provisions, this bill {{provided}} $124 billion for {{military operations in}} Iraq and Afghanistan and required that President Bush withdraw American forces from Iraq by mid-2008; it additionally prohibited the use of funds offered under the act to deploy any troops to Iraq unless the military has certified to congressional appropriators in advance that the military unit is fully mission-capable (while authorizing the president to waive the prohibition and deployment limits on a unit-by-unit basis for reasons of national security). The proposed bill also set requirements for Department of Homeland Security contracts, subcontracts and task orders, and required that each federal agency that had awarded at least $1 billion worth of contracts in the preceding fiscal year develop and implement a plan to minimize the use of no-bid and cost-reimbursement contracts; provided funds for disaster relief and recovery related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, for influenza pandemic response programs, for livestock disaster assistance, and made appropriations to bolster Medicare and Medicaid; it amended fair labor laws to phase-in an increase of the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour and applied these wage requirements to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and to American Samoa; addressed several tax issues by including tax breaks for small businesses, making certain dependents ineligible for the lowest capital gains rate, and lengthening the period of failure to notify a taxpayer of liability before interest and certain penalties must be suspended. The measure also increased the amount of any required installment <b>of</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>tax</b> otherwise <b>due</b> in 2012 from a corporation with assets of $1 billion or more.Johnson attracted attention by blogging about his decision {{to vote for the}} bill.

Tax revenue in Africa have been relatively low on average as a percentage of GDP. Since buoyancy echoes the capacity <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> structure to generate revenues during economic growth, in this study an attempt was made to <b>estimate</b> the buoyancies <b>of</b> income <b>tax,</b> value added tax, import tax, excise tax and total tax revenues in using annual data from 1972 to 2014 in the largest economies in the eastern and southern parts of Africa.
