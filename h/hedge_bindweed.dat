40|$|Virus {{symptoms}} were observed on <b>Hedge</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Calystegia sepium) a well known plant in Hungary. In the literature {{there is no}} record of virus infection on <b>Hedge</b> <b>bindweed,</b> therefore, investigations were carried out to determine the causal agent. Sap from leaves showing virus-like symptoms was inoculated onto test plants inducing systemic infection on Nicotiana clevelandii, N. benthamiana, local lesions on Chenopodium quinoa and no infection on Datura stramonium and Cucumis sativus. Sap of N. clevelandii was examined by electron microscopy, showed the presence of long flexous particles. The biological and other properties of the virus have also been studied. Properties of particles in sap were as follows: TIP (thermal inactivation point) : 78 °C, LIV (longevity in vitro) : 26 days and DEP (dilution end point) : log 10 minus 5. The size of coat protein is 36 kDa, and the genome consists of 7 - 8000 nt RNA. Double-stranded cDNA were produced using random hexanucleotide primers, cloned and sequenced. BLAST search of sequence databases revealed nucleotide sequence identity with carlaviruses. Further investigations are needed to decide whether the virus isolated from <b>Hedge</b> <b>bindweed</b> is a new carlavirus or a new strain of an existing carlavirus...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the degree of {{colonization}} of maize fields by the greater or <b>hedge</b> <b>bindweed,</b> Calystegia sepium L. in the vicinity of Krakow, and to investigate the habitat preferences of this weed. On the basis of field trips, carried out in 88 fields of maize, we found that C. sepium had colonized approximately 30 % of the fields investigated. On average, it covered 17. 5 % of the field area. Multivariate analyses (PCA and RDA) showed that the presence of this species was correlated with that of sandy soils as well as the proximity of streams. Analysis of the morphological features revealed that C. sepium specimens growing both in fields and in natural stands share similar morphological characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Within the {{framework}} of the European COST Action 816, a five-year collabora-tion between scientists from five European countries has made an important contribution to biological control of field and hedge bindweeds (Convolvulus arvensis and Calystegia sepium, respectively). A fungus Stagonospora convolvuli strain LA 39, able to infect both field and <b>hedge</b> <b>bindweed,</b> was found in the UK and its biocontrol efficacy improved by optimising mass production, formulation and storage techniques. This fungus controlled bindweeds in both a cemetery and in maize crops. Its use fits best in an integrated pest management system where a green cover controls most of the weeds except the bindweeds. DNA marker analyses indicate that the fungus reproduces sexually, which could be used to further improve this mycoherbicide. In addition, the insect Melanagromyza albocilia, which itself exhibits biocon-trol potential against bindweeds, may be used in combination with LA 39 to improve the ability of the fungus to penetrate the stem of bindweeds. Overall, the results suggest that S. convolvul...|$|E
40|$|The most {{abundant}} protein of resting rhizomes of Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Br. (<b>hedge</b> <b>bindweed)</b> has been isolated and its corresponding cDNA cloned. The native protein {{consists of a}} single polypeptide of 212 amino acid residues and occurs as a mixture of glycosylated and unglycosylated isoforms. Both forms are derived from the same preproprotein containing a signal peptide and a C-terminal propeptide. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the C. sepium protein shows high sequence identity and structural similarity with plant RNases. However, no RNase activity could be detected in highly purified preparations of the protein. This apparent lack of activity results most probably from the replacement of a conserved His residue, which {{is essential for the}} catalytic activity of plant RNases. Our findings not only demonstrate the occurrence of a catalytically inactive variant of an S-like RNase, but also provide further evidence that genes encoding storage proteins may have evolved from genes encoding enzymes or other biologically active proteins. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A novel plant lectin {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the rhizomes of Calystegia sepium (<b>hedge</b> <b>bindweed)</b> and partially characterized. The lectin is a dimeric protein composed of two identical non-covalently linked subunits of 16 kDa. Hapten inhibition studies indicate that the novel lectin is best inhibited by maltose and mannose and hence exhibits a sugar binding specificity that differs in some respects from that of all previously isolated plant lectins. Mitogenicity tests {{have shown that the}} Calystegia lectin is a powerful T-cell mitogen. Affinity purification of human, plant and fungal glycoproteins on immobilized C. sepium lectin demonstrates that this novel lectin can be used for the isolation of glycoconjugates from various sources. Moreover, it can be expected that by virtue of its distinct specificity, the new lectin will become an important tool in glycobiology.

40|$|Bois noir is an {{important}} grapevine yellows disease in Europe that can cause serious economic losses in grapevine production. It is caused by stolbur phytoplasma strains of the taxonomic group 16 Sr-XII-A. Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret (Hemiptera: Cixiidae) {{is the most important}} vector of bois noir in Europe. This polyphagous planthopper is assumed to mainly use stinging nettle [Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae) ] and field bindweed [Convolvulus arvensis L. (Convolvulaceae) ] as its host plants. For {{a better understanding of the}} epidemiology of bois noir in Switzerland, host plant preferences of H. obsoletus were studied in the field and in the laboratory. In vineyards of Western Switzerland, adults of H. obsoletus were primarily captured on U. dioica, but a few specimens were also caught on C. arvensis, <b>hedge</b> <b>bindweed</b> [Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Brown (Convolvulaceae) ], and five other dicotyledons [i. e., Clematis vitalba L. (Ranunculaceae), Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae), Plantago lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae), Polygonum aviculare L. (Polygonaceae), and Taraxacum officinale Weber (Asteraceae) ]. The preference of the vector for U. dioica compared to C. arvensis was confirmed by a second, more targeted field study and by the positioning of emergence traps above the two plant species. Two-choice experiments in the laboratory showed that H. obsoletus adults originating from U. dioica preferred to feed and to oviposit on U. dioica compared to C. arvensis. However, H. obsoletus nymphs showed no host plant preference, even though they developed much better on U. dioica than on C. arvensis. Similarly, adults survived significantly longer on U. dioica than on C. arvensis or any other plant species tested [i. e., L. draba and Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae) ]. In conclusion, although nymphs of H. obsoletus had no inherent host plant preference, adults tested preferred to feed and oviposit on U. dioica, which is in agreement with the observed superior performance of both nymphal and adult stages on this plant species. Urtica dioica appears to be the principal host plant of H. obsoletus in Switzerland and plays therefore {{an important}} role in the epidemiology of the bois noir disease in Swiss vineyards...|$|E
