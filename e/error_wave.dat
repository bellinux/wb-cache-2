40|$|Background Focused wave groups offer a {{means for}} coastal {{engineers}} to determine extreme run-up and overtopping events. Research purpose This work examines numerically the importance of second-order accurate laboratory wave generation for NewWave-type focused wave groups generated by a piston-type paddle generator, and interacting with a plane beach and a seawall in a wave basin. Methods The numerical wave tank {{is based on the}} Boussinesq equations for non-breaking waves, and the non-linear shallow water equations for broken waves. During the model validation, good agreement is achieved between the numerical predictions and laboratory measurements of free surface elevation, run-up distances and overtopping volumes for the test cases driven by linear paddle signals. Errors in run-up distance and overtopping volume, arising from linear wave generation, are then assessed numerically by repeating the test cases using second-order accurate paddle signals. Results Focused wave groups generated using first-order wave-maker theory are found to be substantially contaminated by a preceding long <b>error</b> <b>wave,</b> resulting in erroneously enhanced run-up distances and overtopping volumes. Conclusions Thus, the use of second-order wave-maker theory for wave group run-up and overtopping experiments is instead recommended. </p...|$|E
40|$|Insight is {{provided}} into focused wave group runup {{on a plane}} beach by means of laboratory wave flume experiments and numerical simulations. A focused wave group is presented {{as an alternative to}} an empirical description of the wave conditions leading to extreme runup. Secondorder correction to the laboratory wavemaker generation signal is observed to remove about 60 % of the sub-harmonic <b>error</b> <b>wave</b> that would otherwise contaminate coastal response experiments. Laboratory measurements of the wave runup time history are obtained using inclined resistancetype wires and copper strips attached to the beach surface. The numerical wave runup model is based on hybrid Boussinesq-Nonlinear Shallow Water equations, empirical parameters for wave breaking and bed friction, and a wetting and drying algorithm. After calibration against experimental runup data, the numerical model reproduces satisfactorily the propagation, shoaling and runup of focused wave groups over {{the entire length of the}} wave flume. Results from a comprehensive parametric study show that both measured and predicted maximum runup elevations exhibit strong dependence on the linear focus amplitude of the wave group (linked to its probability of occurrence), the focus location, and the phase of the wave group at focus. The results also demonstrate that extreme runup events owing to focused wave incidence cannot be characterised using spectral parameters alone. The optimal band of focus locations shifts onshore as linear focus amplitude of the incident wave group increases. Optimisation of phase and focus location leads to a maximum runup elevation at each linear amplitude, and, when generated using second-order corrected paddle signals, the maximum runup appears to approach saturation at very large focused wave amplitudes. This study therefore moves beyond simple wave focusing, and presents a focused wave group as a tool for investigating the relationship between extremes within an incident wave field and extreme wave runup...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the world's population and physical assets are located in low lying coastal zones. Accurate prediction of wave induced run-up and overtopping of sea defences are important in defining the extent and severity of wave action, and in assessing risk to people and property from severe storms and tsunamis. This thesis describes a one-dimensional numerical model based on the Boussinesq equations of Madsen and Sorensen (1992) and the non-linear shallow water equations. The model is suitable for simulating propagation of weakly non-linear and weakly dispersive waves from intermediate to zero depth, such that any inundation and/or overtopping caused by the incoming waves is also calculated as part of the simulation. Wave breaking is approximated by locally switching to the non-linear shallow water equations, which can model broken waves as bores. A piston paddle wavemaker is incorporated into the model for complete reproduction of laboratory experiments. A domain mapping technique is used {{in the vicinity of the}} paddle to transform a time-varying domain into a fixed domain, so that the governing equations can be more readily solved. First, various aspects of the numerical model are verified against known analytical and newly derived semi-analytical solutions. The complete model is then validated with laboratory measurements of run-up and overtopping involving solitary waves. NewWave focused wave groups, which give the expected shape of extreme wave events in a linear random sea, are used for further validation. Simulations of experiments of wave group run-up on a plane beach yield very good agreement with the measured run-up distances and free surface time series. Wave-by-wave overtopping induced by focused wave groups is also successfully simulated with the model, with satisfactory agreement between the experimental and the predicted overtopping volumes. Repeated simulations, now driven by second order paddle displacement signals, give insight into second order error waves spuriously generated by using paddle signals derived from linear theory. Separation of harmonics reveals that the long <b>error</b> <b>wave</b> is significantly affecting the wave group shape and leading to enhanced runu-up distances and overtopping volumes. An extensive parameter study is carried out using the numerical model investigating the influence on wave group run-up of linear wave amplitude at focus, linear focus location, and wave group phase at focus. For a given amplitude, both the phase and the focus location significantly affect the wave group run-up. It is also found that the peak optimised run-up increases with the wave amplitude, but wave breaking becomes an inhibiting factor for larger waves. This methodology is proposed for extreme storm wave induced run-up analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The error analysis is confirmed with numerical simulations. In addition, a Fourier analysis of the fully discrete scheme is conducted which shows the dependence of the frequency <b>error</b> and <b>wave</b> dissipation on the time step and mesh size.

40|$|The grazing {{function}} g is introduced—a synchrobetatron optical quantity that {{is analogous}} (and closely connected) to the Twiss and dispersion functions β, α, η, and η^{′}. It parametrizes {{the rate of}} change of total angle with respect to synchrotron amplitude for grazing particles, which just touch the surface of an aperture when their synchrotron and betatron oscillations are simultaneously (in time) at their extreme displacements. The grazing function can be important at collimators with limited acceptance angles. For example, it is important in both modes of crystal collimation operation—in channeling and in volume reflection. The grazing function is independent of the collimator type—crystal or amorphous—but can depend strongly on its azimuthal location. The rigorous synchrobetatron condition g= 0 is solved, by invoking the close connection between the grazing function and the slope of the normalized dispersion. Propagation of the grazing function is described, through drifts, dipoles, and quadrupoles. Analytic expressions are developed for g in perfectly matched periodic FODO cells, and in the presence of β or η <b>error</b> <b>waves.</b> These analytic approximations are shown to be, in general, in good agreement with realistic numerical examples. The grazing function is shown to scale linearly with FODO cell bend angle, but to be independent of FODO cell length. The ideal value is g= 0 at the collimator, but finite nonzero values are acceptable. Practically achievable grazing functions are described and evaluated, for both amorphous and crystal primary collimators, at RHIC, the SPS (UA 9), the Tevatron (T- 980), and the LHC...|$|R

40|$|Two {{interesting}} numerical {{methods for}} treating convective transport are investigated: the dispersion-relation-preservation (DRP) scheme, proposed by Tam and Webb, and the unified space-time a-ε method, developed by Chang. The space-time a-ε method directly controls the level of dispersion and dissipation via a free parameter, ε, while the DRP scheme minimizes the error by matching {{the characteristics of the}} wave. Insight into the dispersive and dissipative aspects in each scheme is gained from analyzing the truncation error. Even though both methods are explicit in time, the appropriate ranges of the CFL number, v, are different between them. For the DRP scheme, it is preferable if v is close to 0. 2 for short waves, and close to 0. 1 for intermediate and long waves. With v less than but close to 1, matching between v and ε can substantially affect the accuracy of the space-time method. For both methods, different performance characteristics are observed between long and short waves.

The performance of the local time-steppingmethod is evaluated in terms of numerical ef ciency andaccuracy throughapplication to a non-reacting bluff-body ow. For this test case, {{it is found that}} local time stepping can accelerate the global convergence of the hybrid method by as much as an order of magnitude, depending on the grid stretching. Additionally, local time stepping is found to improve signi cantly the robustness of the hybrid method mainly due to the accelerated convection of <b>error</b> <b>waves</b> out of the computationaldomain.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 In {{this thesis}} we {{construct}} compatible discretizations of Maxwell's equations. We {{use the term}} compatible to describe numerical methods for Maxwell's equations which obey many properties of vector Calculus in a discrete setting. Compatible discretizations preserve the exterior Calculus ensuring that the divergence of the curl and the curl of a gradient are zero in a discrete setting. This compatibility of discretizations with the continuum Maxwell's equations guarantees that the numerical solutions are physically meaningful. We focus {{on the construction of}} a class of discretizations called Mimetic Finite Differences (MFD). The MFD method is a generalization of both staggered finite differences and mixed finite elements. We construct a parameterized family of MFD methods with equivalent formal order of accuracy. For time-dependent problems, we exploit this non-uniqueness by finding parameters which are optimal with respect to a certain criteria, for example, minimizing dispersion error. Dispersion error is a numerical artifact in which individual frequencies in a wave propagate at incorrect speeds; dominating the <b>error</b> in <b>wave</b> problems over long time propagation.

The purpose of the experiment was to better understand the role of the urban environment, represented by macro-roughness, in changing tsunami flow during inundation on land. An instrumented specimen was suspended from a truss at the end (landward side) of the basin and many runs of 10 s and 15 s <b>error</b> function <b>waves</b> were conducted to form a baseline to which the macro-roughness setups could be compared. The instrumentation on the specimen included pressure sensors, wire resistance run up gages and a load cell. Within the basin, wire resistance wave gages, ultrasonic wave gages and acoustic Doppler velocimeters recorded the wave as it progressed through the tank. Eight different setups of macro-roughness were placed between the specimen and the beach slope to analyze the effect on the tsunami as measured by the specimen. Argus and web-enabled cameras in the ceiling of the tsunami wave basin were used to aid in interpreting the in-situ measurements and specimen response. The setups were categorized into three groups, the first group to observe the effect of increasing the number of macro-roughness elements in front of the specimen, the second group to observe the effect of increasing the spacing between a pair of macro-roughness elements and the final group to observe the effect of varying the locations of a set number of macro-roughness elements.
