40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new welding-based {{solution}} that significantly increases the rotation {{capacity of a}} stiffened welded knee joint between cold-formed rectangular hollow sections under opening moment. The proposed solution is more economical than the use of <b>internal</b> <b>sleeves</b> and {{can be applied to}} new as well as existing structures. The solution involves the use of extra layers of weld on the inner (tension) flange of a stiffened welded knee joint. Laboratory test results are presented to demonstrate that the solution enabled such a joint between DuraGal C 450 150 × 50 × 4 or 150 × 50 × 5 rectangular hollow sections manufactured to AS 1163 to satisfy the rotation capacity requirement specified for plastic design of steel frames. The reason why the new solution results in increased rotation capacities is explained in terms of strain redistribution and strain reduction in the tensile regions around the knee joints...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tests on}} {{various types of}} knee joints for portal frames constructed from cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS). Welded stiffened and unstiffened knee joints, bolted knee joints with end plates, and connections with a fabricated <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{were included in the}} experimental investigation. Most connections tested under opening moment failed by fracture in the heat affected zone of the RHS near the weld. The connections tested under closing moment failed by web local buckling which occurred near the connection. While the stiffened and unstiffened welded connections satisfied the strength interaction requirements in the available design guides, the connections did not maintain the plastic moment for sufficiently large rotation to be considered suitable for a plastic hinge location. The unstiffened welded joints were not able to reach the plastic moment. The use of an <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre-line and reduced the stress on the weld between the legs of the connection.

The connector utilized mild steel pipe as sleeve where the sleeve consists of external and <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> with the diameter of the external sleeve is larger than <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in the sleeve.

Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside the sleeve and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted sleeve connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral. The test shows that {{the performance of the}} grouted sleeve connector with or without steel spiral was governed by grout-bar bond, anchorage length and confinement action provided by the sleeve and the steel spiral.

Firstly, a series of bending tests examined the plate slenderness limits for RHS.

Secondly, connection tests investigated various types of column-rafter knee joints in portal frames.

40|$|Cellular {{growth in}} higher plants is {{generated}} (powered) by internal turgor pressure. Basic physics {{shows that the}} pressure required to deform a plastic tube by elongation is inversely proportional to the tube's diameter. Accordingly, the turgor required to drive tip growth of very narrow cylindrical plant cells becomes very high, probably too high to be realized in living cells. The non-involvement of turgor in tip growth is demonstrated directly in living diatoms secreting fine tubular spines of silica. In some species, the membrane {{at the tip of}} the rigid tube is deformed inwards into its lumen during normal extension, whereas in other species, many cells are partly plasmolysed during normal, active spine ('seta') extension. Evidence from other cells is consistent with the general conclusion that turgor is not significant in tip growth. We support the alternative hypothesis proposed by M. Harold and colleagues that extension in tip cells can be amoeboid, driven by cycling of the actin cytoskeleton. Actively growing setae display an <b>internal,</b> fibrous, collar-like <b>sleeve,</b> probably of actin at the tip; it is visualized as a molecular treadmill ('nanomachine') that uses as its support-base the rigid tube that has just been secreted. This scenario can thereby explain how the perfectly even diameter of very long, fine setae is maintained throughout their extension, even when their tips are far distant from the cell body...|$|R
40|$|Yttrium is {{a notable}} trace element {{particularly}} compatible with garnet. Lanzirotti (1995) provided evidences that, among major metapelitic minerals, yttrium preferentially partitions into garnet {{and that the}} mode of major metapelite phases besides garnet have little effect on its fractionation. On the contrary trace elements are extremely sensitive to changes in accessory mineral assemblage (e. g. Ganguly, 2010). Xenotime (YPO 4) is a common accessory mineral in metapelites and arguments for garnet growth in equilibrium with xenotime are presented in several papers (e. g. Martin, 2009). Pyle & Spear (1999) described a relevant temperature control on the solubility of yttrium in garnet in xenotime-bearing metapelites from New England (USA). On {{the basis of a}} strong negative correlation between Y concentration and temperature they derived an empirical calibration to be used as geothermometer. However, no experimental studies do exist to date on the temperature dependence of Y partitioning between garnet and xenotime. In order to unravel this relation, high pressure (up to 2. 0 GPa) xenotime – saturated synthesis of garnet have been performed in an end-loaded piston cilynder. The simple model system MgO-FeO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 has been investigated at temperature between 800 and 1000 °C running compositions falling along the join almandine-pyrope + 5 wt% YPO 4. Gels have been prepared as starting materials using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as silica source, pure Mg-, Al-, Ca-, Y-nitric solutions, ferric benzoate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4) digested in deionised water. Gels were fired in a gas-mixing furnace at fO 2 conditions approaching the IW (iron-wustite) buffer at 1 atm for 3 hours. The powder was tightly packed into a gold capsule with an <b>internal</b> graphite <b>sleeve</b> to keep the oxygen fugacity low. Run products were preliminary identified by X-ray powder diffraction, carefully inspected on back-scattered electron images and by X ray element maps, and analysed by electron microprobe and particle-induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE). The use of the proton microprobe stems from its higher spatial resolution and lower X-ray background with respect to electron microprobe. This allows to measure trace element concentrations down to levels of ~ 1 ppm on a 1 m beam spot (Fraser, 1990). Preliminary results will be discussed. References Biggar, G. M. & O’Hara, M. J.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{suitability}} of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design. The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames. A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams. The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS {{can be used in}} plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required. Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised. Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design. The major conclusions of the beam tests were: (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design. (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate. An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS. Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame. The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames. The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated. The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred. The use of an <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load. The <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design. Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed. There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads. Two grades of steel were used for comparison. The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames. In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism. An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames. The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects. A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections. While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed. This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required. A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation. To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed. The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear. The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity. Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results. There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{deals with}} a new design of a joint between a steel pipe and a PE-HD pipe, which is called a {{transition}} piece and is intended for transmission of liquid and gas media. As a pipe fitting it connects a PE-HD pipeline, which is usually laid underground, outside a building, and a steel pipeline, which is mounted in a building. Design/methodology/approach: Paper gives some theoretical considerations on welding steel with PE-HD and other joining processes suitable for dissimilar materials such as metals and plastics. A production technology, stress calculations for the joint and an analysis of testing of the transition piece are described. An experimental research of a new “joint” between steel and PE-HD pipes is given. Findings: The most important part in formation of a joint between steel and PE-HD pipes is played by an <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> of high-alloy stainless steel, which expends the PE-HD pipe mounted {{in the interior of}} the expanded part of the steel pipe by elastic mechanical force. Theoretical stress calculations indicating the force required to tear the PE-HD pipe from the transition piece constitute an important part. An analysis of pressure and strength tests under different conditions, i. e. with different temperatures, moisture conditions, inner overpressures and underpressures, is given. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of application of this research work for study an other of the transition piece, which are consisted of an other dissimilar materials. Practical implications: Such joints, called transmission pieces, are possible applied to residential premises where the steel part makes the beginning of a steel fitting {{in the house and the}} PE-HD pipe the end of the outside pipeline network. Originality/value: The paper presents a completely new design of the transition piece, which does not consist of any screw elements or seals made of materials susceptible to quick aging...|$|E
40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a coring bit is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning coring bit (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a coring bit were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an <b>internal</b> <b>sleeve</b> to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a coring bit without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density. A controlled acceleration or deceleration may be used to drop the least-frictional particles or to eventually shear the unconsolidated material near the bit center...|$|E
