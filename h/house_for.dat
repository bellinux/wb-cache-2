40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{characteristics}} of <b>house</b> designs <b>for</b> the elderly and disabled. We devised a method for characterizing the plans of new houses and compared examples of new <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> the disabled and ordinary non-adapted houses in the Hokkaido region of Japan. We examined 65 <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> the disabled and 70 ordinary non-adapted houses. The results showed that the proportion of corridor type designs, in which there are two lines of flow in the bedroom, was significantly more in the <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> the disabled. In addition, more classifications were needed to categorize the <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> the disabled, some of which contained a toilet and/or bathroom for exclusive use by the disabled member of the household. 本研究の目的は，高齢者・障害者同居住宅の平面構成の特性を明らかにすることである。そのために，住宅平面の類型化を用いた手法を新たに考案し，北海道内の新築事例から障害者住宅と一般住宅とを比較検討した。得られたサンプル数は障害者住宅が 65 ，一般住宅が 70 だった。その結果，障害者住宅は，一般住宅に比べて本人の寝室に 2 つの動線をもつ「回廊型」が有意に多いことが示された。また，障害者住宅は類型化した全てのタイプに分散され，さらにトイレ・浴室が本人専用であることから疑似型が生じた。従って，障害者住宅の平面特性として「回廊型」が多く，多様性であることが示唆される...|$|R
