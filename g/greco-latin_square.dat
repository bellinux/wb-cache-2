40|$|Four {{ecological}} zones of the Gambia River were sampled during four different hydrologic seasons for determination of microbial, nutrient, and physical parameters. A <b>Greco-Latin</b> <b>Square</b> experimental design {{was used to}} define the particular transect, station, depth, and tide/time-of-day of samples taken. Ranges of total bacterioplankton densities (10 6 cells/ml) {{were similar to those}} of tropical and temperate environments. Numbers of free bacteria were similar temporally, whereas attached bacteria numbers were greater during periods of high stream flows when suspended solids concentrations were higher. Free bacteria were usually twice as numerous in the freshwater zones than in the estuarine zones. Attached bacterial densities were approximately four times greater in the estuarine zones than in the freshwater zones. Uptake of 3 H-glucose on both a sample volume and per-cell basis increased from {{the early stages of the}} flood (6. 95 ±SE 1. 37 ng/liter/hour and 3. 8 pg/hour/ 10 6 cells, respectively) and reached observed annual maximums during the dry season (21. 01 ±SE 3. 05 ng/ liter/hour and 13. 0 pg/hour/ 10 6 cells, respectively). Spatially, 3 H-glucose uptake per sample volume and per cell was highest in the upper river zone and lowest in the lower estuary zone. The lower estuary zone consistently acted out of concert with the other river zones in terms of 3 H-glucose and 14 C-bicarbonate uptake. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that free and attached bacterioplankton densities were not homogeneous among transects, stations, depths, and tide/time-of-day at the different zones during the four hydrologic seasons. The results suggested that heterotrophy overshadowed autotrophy in the river and that the bacterial abundance, distribution, and glucose uptake activity in this tropical floodplain river were greatly influenced by the annual flood and the presence of extensive mangrove forests in the estuary...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental and theoretical studies aimed at expanding the {{applications of the}} copolymers {{on the basis of}} the waste styrene production. One of the areas is used as impregnating compositions of wood materials, selection of optimal conditions modification on samples of the most widely used in the industry of wood, such as birch, aspen and other. Studies were conducted to obtain and use an impregnating compositions based on copolymers synthesized from waste products of styrene and the cubic remainder rectification of ethylbenzene (CRRE) for the protective treatment of birch wood. Identified physic-chemical characteristics of physical mixtures of copolymers «CORS», «STAM», CRRE at different ratios. Studied the process of modification birch using the method of experiment planning <b>greco-latin</b> <b>square</b> of the fourth order, and the influence of such factors as the temperature of the impregnating composition, the duration of the impregnation, the temperature and duration of thermal treatment on the performance moisture resistance of wood. Were established optimal conditions modification birch wood treated impregnating compositions on the basis of physical mixtures of copolymer «CORS» with CRRE and copolymer «STAM» with CRRE is the mixing ratio 2 : 1, the duration and temperature of the impregnation 7 h and 95 0 C, time and temperature of heat treatment 7 h and 170 0 C, respectively. A sealing composition containing CRRE with copolymer «STAM» 1 : 2 is more preferable, as in the structure of the copolymer «STAM» contains carboxyl and anhydrite group. Thus was justified use for the modification of natural wood impregnating compositions on the basis of physical mixtures of CRRE with copolymers «CORS» and «STAM», which improve the properties of wood, increase moisture and weather resistance more than twice...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine the effects of herbage mass [HM, based on regrowth intervals of 35 (T) and 21 (S) days] and herbage allowance [HA, 20. 2 (H) and 12. 7 (L) kg organic matter (OM) /cow] on herbage OM intake (OMI), dietary composition and ingestive behaviour of dairy cows. Four groups of three cows each were used in a 4 × 4 <b>greco-latin</b> <b>square</b> design along with four oesophageal-fistulated cows. The treatment periods were 7 days and the squares (SQ) were repeated three times in a balanced way. The {{experiment was}} conducted from 11 April to 3 July 1986. The HM (organic matter) above 3 cm was 3064, 3472 and 3515 kg/ha for T and 2395, 1113 and 2396 kg/ha (s. e. 94) for S, for SQ 1 to 3, respectively. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) was 842, 799 and 778 g/kg for T, and 851, 842 and 804 g/kg for S (s. e. 0. 9), for SQ 1 to 3, respectively. Sward height (cm) after grazing was 8. 5 and 7. 6 for T and S, and 9. 6 and 6. 5 for H and L (s. e. 0. 18), respectively. OMI was 15. 2, 14. 8 and 15. 2 kg for TH, 12. 3, 11. 9 and 10. 7 kg for TL, 15. 8, 14. 8 and 14. 5 kg for SH and 11. 9, 11. 1 and 11. 2 kg for SL (s. e. 0. 24), for SQ 1 to 3, respectively. The OMD of the diet was closely related to proportion of live leaf in the diet and sward OMD. Average biting rate increased with decreasing HM (R 2 0. 65). Grazing time was 8. 93, 9. 11 and 9. 06 h for TH, 8. 13, 7. 96 and 7. 91 h for TL, 8. 96, 9. 59 and 9. 29 h for SH and 8. 56, 9. 36 and 8. 52 h for SL (s. e. 0. 155), for SQ 1 to 3, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that OMI was significantly related to HM (+ 0. 48 kg/t), OMD of the sward (+ 0. 18 kg per 10 g/kg) and pre-experimental milk yield (+ 0. 37 kg/kg) (R 2 0. 89). The increase in OMI with potential milk yield, as indicated by pre-experimental yield, accounted for 0. 80 of the supplementary energy requirements. peer-reviewedNational Development Plan 2000 - 200...|$|E
