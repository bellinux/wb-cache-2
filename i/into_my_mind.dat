25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus that {{involved}} concentration on individual solo projects, Rowland rejoined Beyoncé Knowles and Michelle Williams for Destiny's Child's final studio album Destiny Fulfilled, released in November 2004. Meanwhile, Rowland had started {{work on the}} conception of her second solo studio album. She began collaborating with songwriter-producer Bryan Michael Cox, partner WyldCard, and production duo CKB. Some of their early recordings, including [...] "Bad Habit" [...] and [...] "Flashback", were later included on Destiny's Child's final studio album {{as well as the}} group's live DVD [...] (2006), respectively. As she was anxious to avoid hasty productions as on her previous album, which Rowland felt was less personal, she took a wider role in the production of the album; the singer co-wrote the majority of the songs and shared ideas in which one to produce. [...] "I wrote a lot on this record [...] and it's especially from me ," [...] she told CNN about the album. [...] "It's a feelgood record; very intimate. It's a sneak peak <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and heart of the past three or four years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooper's dream {{at the end}} of {{the third}} episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and {{ultimately}} held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: [...] "I was leaning against a car—the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room." [...] The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.|$|E

Moreover, I carried a bag of silver coin, quite large {{enough to make it}} well worth while, to rob me.

2500|$|The {{book was}} written between 1959 and 1960. L'Engle wrote {{repeatedly}} about {{the writing of}} the story and the long struggle to get it published. In A Circle of Quiet (1972), she explains that the book was conceived [...] "during a time of transition." [...] After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut and running a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country and back again. L'Engle writes that [...] "we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> came the names, MrsWhatsit. MrsWho. MrsWhich." [...] This was in the spring of 1959. L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time, which also made its way into the story. When she completed the book in early 1960, however, it was rejected by at least 26publishers, because it was, in L'Engle's words, [...] "too different," [...] and [...] "because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children's or an adults' book, anyhow?" ...|$|E
