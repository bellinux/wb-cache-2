5|$|Napoleon was <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allied {{forces would}} attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle. He shrugged off their suggestion of retreat.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was {{involved}} in. He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> truth of what was done to him may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur {{the keys to the}} car and walking away.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E

Unexpectedly, however, Murdock encourages Bart to continue on his legacy. Bart plans to do it against the wishes of Homer, who insists that it is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|VThe king of Spain (of the time) {{commissioned}} Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps as {{a friendly}} gesture towards Napoleon, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flattering gift would strengthen relationships between France and Spain, {{to the degree}} that Napoleon would not consider invading Spain and taking it over, after he became emperor. However, the king of Spain's attempt failed, and, soon after Napoleon crowned himself emperor, he crossed the Pyrenees and conquered Spain.|$|E
5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of encouragement to the missionaries.|$|E

5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{contacts}} with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslims, humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Divya is a free-spirited {{college student}} from a {{conservative}} family whose strict father, Chandramouli, {{works for the}} government. She learns that her parents are eagerly awaiting a marriage proposal for her. Unwilling to get married, and <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> groom's family will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late to find Chandrakumar (the groom) and his family patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, {{he says that he}} likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her family begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Al-Kateb {{appealed the}} {{decision}} against {{him to a}} Full Court of the Federal Court, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reasoning applied in the Al Masri case (which was factually similar to his situation) would be applied to him. The appeal was removed into the High Court {{at the request of}} the then Attorney-General of Australia Daryl Williams, under provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903. Pending the appeal, Al-Kateb was released in April 2003, by an interlocutory consent order of the Federal Court. The case was argued alongside two other cases which also concerned immigration detention and hearings were held on 12 November and 13 November 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|Minh {{was said}} to have been deeply {{affected}} by the loss of his long-time aide, and it was reported that the general erected an altar dedicated to Nhung's memory in his office, with the major's portrait on it. Shortly after the coup, Khánh made Minh the figurehead head of state under American advice, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of the popular general would help to unify the armed forces, but Minh made little attempt to help Khánh, partly because of resentment over the loss of his aide.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety, but probably <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The Athenian expedition, led by Mantias, still {{landed at}} Methone on the Macedonian coast, with 3,000 {{mercenary}} troops. Mantias now declined to leave Methone, so Argeus instead led the {{troops to the}} ancient Macedonian capital of Aegae, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> populace would declare him king. However, the people of Aegae showed no interest in doing so, and Argeus therefore marched back to Methone. On the way, he was attacked and defeated in battle by Philip, many of the Athenian mercenaries being slain and the rest taken captive. According to Diodorus, this victory did much to restore {{the morale of the}} Macedonian army, and gave the soldiers encouragement for the battles to come.|$|E
