40|$|This article, {{the final}} {{one of a}} series on the design of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes,</b> {{contains}} a description of an instrument which illustrates the principles previously discussed. The microscope described {{is believed to be the}} first constructed with the object of providing the greatest of simplicity in construction, operation, and maintenance with the design parameters balanced to give a particular range of resolving power. The range chosen is about ten times the light microscope. The instrument is permanently aligned and utilizes external photography. The over-all size and weight of the instrument, as well as the number and complexity of components, are materially less than previously described instruments...|$|R
50|$|In 1928, at the Technical University of Berlin, Adolf Matthias, Professor of High voltage Technology and Electrical Installations, {{appointed}} Max Knoll {{to lead a}} team {{of researchers}} to advance the CRO design. The team consisted of several PhD students including Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries. The research team worked on lens design and CRO column placement, to optimize parameters to construct better CROs, and make electron optical components to generate low magnification (nearly 1:1) images. In 1931 the group successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over the anode aperture. The device used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, arguably creating the first <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> In that same year, Reinhold Rudenberg, the scientific director of the Siemens company, patented an <b>electrostatic</b> lens <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} tilted electrostatic actuators on the imaging in <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Previous studies have shown image deformation by <b>electrostatic</b> actuation in <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes,</b> and suggested a strong influence of the tilt angle on the deflection of the electron beam. Our model suggests an influence of 1 μ m/^∘ of the tilt angle on the amplitude of deflection. Preliminary experimental results indicate an influence of the angle on the amplitude of deflection, but the observed effect is two orders of magnitude smaller than simulations predict. However, {{there are still some}} variables we have not explored that might influence the strength of the influence of tilt...|$|R
40|$|An <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> {{has been}} {{constructed}} {{to test a}} number of new methods of obtaining photographs. The aim has been to obtain in as simple a manner as possible both as regards operation and construction a resolving power in the range of the greatest present usefulness of electron microscopy (say ten times better than light microscopy), and to operate in a voltage range sufficient to obtain this resolution for the usual thin specimens. The instrument is a combined <b>electron</b> and light <b>microscope</b> and utilizes unipotential <b>electrostatic</b> <b>electron</b> lenses...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{return to}} the United States from Munich, Ramberg {{returned}} to Cornell and continued the work on which he based his thesis: X-ray satellites and line widths. In 1935, he left Cornell {{to take a position}} at RCA to work on both theoretical and experimental work on secondary emission, pickup tubes, and field electron emission. He later took part {{in the development of the}} theory of thermoelectric refrigeration and image tube aberrations and in demonstrating the mathematical operability of a multistage <b>electrostatic</b> <b>electron</b> multiplier. He also took part in construction of one of the first <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> in the mid-1940s. He remained at RCA until 1972.|$|R

It is installed on an elliptically polarized undulator (EPU) beamline, and will be operated with very high spatial resolution and high flux to study the composition, structure, electric and magnetic properties of complex materials. The instrument has been designed and is described. The instrumental hardware is being deployed in 2 phases. The first phase is the deployment of a standard PEEM type microscope consisting of the standard linear array of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>electron</b> lenses.

40|$|A {{transmission}} <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> {{that takes}} advantage of superconducting quantum circuitry is proposed. The microscope is designed to improve image contrast of radiation-sensitive weak phase objects, in particular biological specimens. The objective in this setting is to measure the phase shift of the probe electron wave to a precision Δθ within the number of electrons N that does not destroy the specimen. In conventional electron microscopy Δθ scales as ∼ 1 /N^ 1 / 2, which falls short of the Heisenberg limit ∼ 1 /N. To approach the latter by using quantum entanglement, we propose a design that involves a Cooper pair box placed {{on the surface of}} an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>electron</b> mirror in the microscope. Significant improvement could be attained if inelastic scattering processes are sufficiently delocalized.

50|$|Microscopes can be {{separated}} into several different classes. One grouping {{is based on}} what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., light or photons (optical <b>microscopes),</b> <b>electrons</b> (<b>electron</b> <b>microscopes)</b> or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classed on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal optical <b>microscopes,</b> scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field optical <b>microscope</b> and transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes).</b>|$|R
