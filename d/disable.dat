New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, <b>disable</b> some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E

40|$|Josefin Sundh, 1 Magnus Ekström 2 1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden; 2 Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence, change in breathlessness status over time, and {{risk factors for}} <b>disabling</b> and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness in relation to treatments in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Materials and methods: Longitudinal analysis of data from the Swedish National Register of COPD with breathlessness measured using modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores at two subsequent visits. Prevalence of <b>disabling</b> breathlessness (mMRC ≥ 2 at baseline) and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness (<b>disabling</b> breathlessness at baseline and follow-up) was investigated in relation to COPD treatment. Risk factors for <b>disabling</b> breathlessness, change from non-disabling to <b>disabling</b> breathlessness, and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 1, 689 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 12  months (interquartile range: 4 months). Prevalence of <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was 54 % at baseline. Persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was present in 43 % of patients despite treatment and in 74 % of patients despite combined inhaled triple therapy and physiotherapy. Risk factors for <b>disabling</b> breathlessness or change to <b>disabling</b> breathlessness were higher age, lower lung function, frequent exacerbations, obesity, heart failure, depression, and hypoxic respiratory failure (all P< 0. 05). Persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was associated with lower lung function and ischemic heart disease (all P< 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Disabling</b> breathlessness is common in COPD despite treatment, which calls for improved symptomatic treatments and consideration of factors influencing <b>disabling</b> breathlessness. Factors influencing <b>disabling</b> breathlessness should be considered for COPD management. Keywords: COPD, breathlessness, dyspnea, longitudinal analysis, treatment, risk factor...|$|R
