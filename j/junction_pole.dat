40|$|Social {{neuroscience}} {{has identified}} different neural networks that support communication and interaction. These can be broadly divided into more affective (empathy and compassion) or cognitive (Theory of Mind (ToM)) domains. While the anterior insula is critically involved in empathy with another, compassion for another activates also subcortical regions including the ventral striatum. ToM tasks typically engage the temporoparietal <b>junction,</b> temporal <b>poles</b> and medial prefrontal cortex. Little {{is known about}} the relation of empathy and ToM, which entails two important questions. The first question concerns the separability of the neural networks underlying empathy and ToM and the relation of inter-individual differences in empathy and ToM, both behaviorally and neurally. This is to say, do individuals high in empathic responding also perform better in ToM tasks, does strong empathic responding hinder mentalizing, or do these routes to understanding others vary independently? The second question concerns the online interaction of the empathy and ToM network during complex social situations. This question asks, how affective and cognitive routes are orchestrated within an individual {{when it comes to the}} understanding of others. Results from a novel paradigm applied in a large-scale longitudinal training study demonstrate relative independence of empathy and ToM on an inter-individual differences level, thus empathizers are not (necessarily) mentalizers. Differential change due to training in one or the other capacity is further, strong evidence for separate networks. The networks underlying empathy and ToM do, however, interact during online understanding of others with the temporoparietal junction acting as a critical node mediating this interaction...|$|R
40|$|Successful social {{interactions}} require both sharing other’s affect (empathy) and reasoning about their mental states (Theory of Mind, ToM). Here, we ask how these psychological constructs can be operationalized to investigate their neural underpinnings in {{a reliable and}} valid way. To this end, we applied a novel fMRI paradigm (EmpaToM) that independently manipulates empathy and ToM by presenting emotional versus neutral videos and subsequently asking ToM versus factual reasoning questions about the narrations in the videos. First, we demonstrate that the behavioral measures in this task correlate with established tasks of empathy and ToM. Second, we show overlap of the observed neural networks including anterior insula and anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex for empathy and ventral temporoparietal <b>junction,</b> temporal <b>poles,</b> anterior and posterior midline regions for ToM with meta-analyses and established fMRI tasks tested in the same participants. Third, we report specific correlations of the behavioral measures with activity in the respective neural networks. Forth, data from four measurement time-points (~ 3 months apart) demonstrate the retest-reliability of the behavioral and neural markers. Fifth, the neural networks can be replicated in item-analyses showing {{the generalizability of the}} results to the respective stimulus classes. Finally, regression analyses ruled out the possibility that stimulus characteristics other than the experimental category are predictive of the neural activity (e. g. video length, number of words, syntactic complexity). In sum, data strongly support {{the reliability and validity of}} the provided behavioral and neural markers of empathy and ToM, opening the possibility to apply the EmpaToM in future basic neuroscience, clinical and intervention studies of social cognition...|$|R
40|$|With recent {{investigation}} {{beginning to}} reveal the cortical and subcortical neuroanatomical correlates of humor appreciation, the present event-related functional MRI (fMRI) {{study was designed to}} elucidate sex-specific recruitment of these humor related networks. Twenty healthy subjects (10 females) underwent fMRI scanning while subjectively rating 70 verbal and nonverbal achromatic cartoons as funny or unfunny. Data were analyzed by comparing blood oxygenation-level-dependent signal activation during funny and unfunny stimuli. Males and females share an extensive humor-response strategy as indicated by recruitment of similar brain regions: both activate the temporal-occipital <b>junction</b> and temporal <b>pole,</b> structures implicated in semantic knowledge and juxtaposition, and the inferior frontal gyrus, likely to be involved in language processing. Females, however, activate the left prefrontal cortex more than males, suggesting a greater degree of executive processing and language-based decoding. Females also exhibit greater activation of mesolimbic regions, including the nucleus accumbens, implying greater reward network response and possibly less reward expectation. These results indicate sex-specific differences in neural response to humor with implications for sex-based disparities in the integration of cognition and emotion...|$|R
40|$|Autobiographical {{episodic memory}} {{represents}} a subsystem of declarative long-term memory and largely depends on combining information from multiple sources. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess neural correlates of declarative long-term memory in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls using fMRI and a task requiring autobiographical and semantic memory retrieval. Comparison of the network supporting episodic autobiographical and semantic memory irrespective of remoteness (recent and remote) revealed significant activations in right parietal cortex and precuneus bilaterally in the patients. Autobiographical episodic versus semantic memory retrieval in the controls led to significant bilateral activations of the parietal-temporal <b>junction,</b> left temporal <b>pole,</b> anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex and cerebellum. In contrast, MCI patients activated left supplementary motor area, left premotor and superior temporal cortex. In MCI patients compared to controls a dysfunction of the retrosplenial cortex during memory retrieval was revealed by a lack of differential activation in relation to recency of memories and memory type. Our data suggest that MCI leads to a loss of specificity in the neural network supporting declarative long-term memory...|$|R
40|$|Exponential-growth-phase {{cultures}} of Bacillus subtilis 168 were probed with polycationized ferritin (PCF) or concanavalin A (localized {{by the addition}} of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to colloidal gold) to distinguish surface anionic sites and teichoic acid polymers, respectively. Isolated cell walls, lysozyme-digested cell walls, and cell walls treated with mild alkali to remove teichoic acid were also treated with PCF. After labelling, whole cells and walls were processed for electron microscopy by freeze-substitution. Thin sections of untreated cells showed a triphasic, fibrous wall extending more than 30 nm beyond the cytoplasmic membrane. Measurements of wall thickness indicated that the wall was thicker at locations adjacent to septa and at pole-cylinder junctions (P < 0. 001). Labelling studies showed that at saturating concentrations the PCF probe labelled the outermost limit of the cell wall, completely surrounding individual cells. However, at limiting PCF concentrations, labelling was observed at only discrete cell surface locations adjacent to or overlying septa and at the <b>junction</b> between <b>pole</b> and cylinder. Labelling was rarely observed along the cell cylinder or directly over the poles. Cells did not label along the cylindrical wall until there was visible evidence of a developing septum. Identical labelling patterns were observed by using concanavalin A-horseradish peroxidase-colloidal gold. Neither probe appeared to penetrate between the fibers of the wall. We suggest that the fibrous appearance of the wall seen in freeze-substituted cells reflects turnover of the wall matrix, that the specificity of labelling to discrete sites on the cell surface is indicative of regions of extreme hydrolytic activity in which alpha-glucose residues of the wall teichoic acids and electronegative sites (contributed by phosphate and carboxyl groups of the teichoic acids and carboxyl groups of the peptidoglycan polymers) are more readily accessible to our probes, and that the wall of exponentially growing B. subtilis cells contains regions of structural differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Individuals react {{differently}} to social experiences; for example, {{people who are}} more sensitive to negative social experiences, such as being excluded, {{may be more likely}} to adapt their behavior to fit in with others. We examined whether functional brain connectivity during social exclusion in the fMRI scanner can be used to predict subsequent conformity to peer norms. Adolescent males (N = 57) completed a two-part study on teen driving risk: a social exclusion task (Cyberball) during an fMRI session and a subsequent driving simulator session in which they drove alone and in the presence of a peer who expressed risk-averse or risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the difference in functional connectivity between social exclusion and social inclusion from each node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one previously associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal <b>junction,</b> precuneus, temporal <b>poles)</b> and another with social pain (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using cross-validated machine learning, this measure of global network connectivity during exclusion predicts the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the subsequent experimental session. These findings extend our understanding of how global neural dynamics guide social behavior, revealing functional network activity that captures individual differences.

40|$|Happiness is {{regarded}} as one of the most fundamental human goals. Given recent reports that positive feelings are contagious (e. g., the presence of a happy person enhances others' happiness) because of the human ability to empathize (i. e., sharing emotions), empathic ability may be a key factor in increasing one's own subjective level of happiness. Based on previous studies indicating that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the serotonin 2 A receptor gene [HTR 2 A rs 6311 guanine (G) vs. adenine (A) ] is associated with sensitivity to emotional stimuli and several mental disorders such as depression, we predicted that the polymorphism might be associated with the effect of sharing happiness. To elucidate the neural and genetic correlates of the effect of sharing happiness, we first performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a “happy feelings” evocation task (emotional event imagination task), during which we manipulated the valence of the imagined event (positive, neutral, or negative), as well as the presence of a friend experiencing a positive-valence event (presence or absence). We recruited young adult women for this fMRI study because empathic ability may be higher in women than in men. Participants felt happier (p < 0. 01) and the mentalizing/theory-of-mind network, which spans the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal <b>junction,</b> temporal <b>poles,</b> and precuneus, was significantly more active (p < 0. 05) in the presence condition than in the absence condition regardless of event valence. Moreover, participants with the GG (p < 0. 01) and AG (p < 0. 05) genotypes of HTR 2 A experienced happier feelings as well as greater activation of a part of the mentalizing/theory-of-mind network (p < 0. 05) during empathy for happiness (neutral/presence condition) than those with the AA genotype. In a follow-up study with a vignette-based questionnaire conducted in a relatively large sample, male and female participants were presented with the same imagined events wherein their valence and the presence of a friend were manipulated. Results showed genetic differences in happiness-related empathy regardless of sex (p < 0. 05). Findings suggest that HTR 2 A polymorphisms are associated with the effect of sharing happiness by modulating the activity of the mentalizing/theory-of-mind network...|$|R
40|$|Social {{neuroscience}} {{has identified}} different neural networks, a more affective (empathy and compassion) {{and a more}} cognitive route (Theory of Mind (ToM)), {{to the understanding of}} others. While the anterior insula (AI) is critically involved when empathizing with the pain of another person, experiencing compassion for another’s suffering activates a different network including the ventral striatum. ToM tasks, in contrast, engage the temporoparietal <b>junction</b> (TPJ), temporal <b>poles</b> (TP) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). The separability and interrelations of these two capacities and their related neural networks is, however, little understood. We, therefore, developed a novel task, the EmpaToM. Participants are presented with naturalistic video stimuli in which people recount autobiographical episodes that are either emotional or neutral. Each video is followed by empathy and compassion ratings and questions about the content of the video that probe ToM. Emotional vs. neutral videos increased activity in bilateral AI, which parametrically modulated with subjective empathy ratings. Compassion ratings, in contrast, covaried with activity in the ventral striatum. ToM activated bilateral TPJ, TP and MPFC. These two networks interact during the online understanding of others. However, inter-individual differences in the activity of these networks were uncorrelated, suggesting some independence, such that strong empathizers are not (necessarily) good mentalizers. Separate training of these capacities within the longitudinal ReSource study has differential enhancing effects on ToM performance and compassion, providing some first evidence that we can induce plasticity in socio-affective and socio-cognitive capacities...|$|R
40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM), {{the ability}} to {{attribute}} mental states to others, and empathy, {{the ability to}} infer emotional experiences, are important processes in social cognition. Brain imaging studies in healthy subjects have described a brain system involving medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus and temporal pole in ToM processing. Studies investigating networks associated with empathic responding also suggest involvement of temporal and frontal lobe regions. In this fMRI study, we used a cartoon task derived from Sarfati et al. (1997) [Sarfati, Y., Hardy-Bayle, M. C., Besche, C., Widlocher, D. 1997. Attribution of intentions to others in people with schizophrenia: a non-verbal exploration with comic strips. Schizophrenia Research 25, 199 - 209. ] with both ToM and empathy stimuli {{in order to allow}} comparison of brain activations in these two processes. Results of 13 right-handed, healthy, male volunteers were included. Functional images were acquired using a 1. 5 T Phillips Gyroscan. Our results confirmed that ToM and empathy stimuli are associated with overlapping but distinct neuronal networks. Common areas of activation included the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal <b>junction</b> and temporal <b>poles.</b> Compared to the empathy condition, ToM stimuli revealed increased activations in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, cuneus and superior temporal gyrus. Empathy, on the other hand, was associated with enhanced activations of paracingulate, anterior and posterior cingulate and amygdala. We therefore suggest that ToM and empathy both rely on networks associated with making inferences about mental states of others. However, empathic responding requires the additional recruitment of networks involved in emotional processing. These results have implications for our understanding of disorders characterized by impairments of social cognition, such as autism and psychopathy. </p...|$|R

In the EmpaToM task, participants were presented with naturalistic video stimuli in which people recount autobiographical episodes that are either emotional or neutral. Each video is followed by empathy and compassion ratings and questions about the content of the video that probe ToM. Participants were tested before and after each training module in a 3 T Scanner. At baseline, emotional vs. neutral videos increased activity in bilateral AI, which parametrically modulated with subjective empathy ratings. Compassion ratings, in contrast, covaried with activity in the ventral striatum. ToM activated bilateral TPJ, TP and MPFC. Inter-individual differences in the activity of these networks were uncorrelated, suggesting independence of these socio-affective and -cognitive abilities. Training in the Perspective, but not the Presence or Affective Module, enhanced performance in ToM questions. The compassion ratings, in contrast, increased more after the Affective and Perspective module, not so however after the Presence module. Similarly, differential change was also observed with regards to the neural networks underlying compassion and ToM. The present results confirm that the neural networks underlying empathy, compassion and ToM can be reliably identified within a single task and also demonstrate their independence on an inter-individual level – strong empathizers are not (necessarily) good mentalizers. Most critically, the training-related changes indicate that Theory of Mind can be trained by specific practices implemented in the Perspective Module. Surprisingly, there was an increase in experienced compassion after both, the Affective and the Perspective Modules. As no effect was observed after the Presence Module, which focused on attention and interoceptive awareness, the readiness to experience compassion seems to only increase after modules involving intersubjective exercises focusing on prosocial affect and motivation (Affective) or cognitive perspective taking of self and others (Perspective). In conclusion, these results provide first evidence that we can induce plasticity in socio-affective and socio-cognitive capacities through specifically designed mental training programs...|$|R
