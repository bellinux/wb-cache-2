2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison <b>fuse</b> <b>holder,</b> and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|E

50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> is displaced and the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows. Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b> This quenches any arc in the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E

When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> using a hot stick.|$|E

50|$|Automotive fuses {{are used}} to protect the wiring and {{electrical}} equipment for vehicles. There are several different types of automotive fuses and their usage is dependent upon the specific application, voltage, and current demands of the electrical circuit. Automotive fuses can be mounted in fuse blocks, inline <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> or <b>fuse</b> clips. Some automotive fuses are occasionally used in non-automotive electrical applications. Standards for automotive fuses are published by SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers).|$|R
5000|$|In {{peaceful}} situations {{one would}} want equipment {{to shut down}} {{so it is not}} damaged. In a battle or emergency, where the survival of the vessel (or other protected asset) is dependent upon the continued operation of the equipment, it is sometimes wiser to risk equipment damage than have the equipment shut down when it is needed. For example, the electrical drives to elevate and traverse the guns of a combat warship may have [...] "battleshort" [...] fuses, which are simply copper bars of the correct size to fit the <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> as failure to return fire in a combat situation may cause loss of the ship and crew and damaging or overheating of the electrical motors is a preferable alternative.|$|R
50|$|Bad {{contacts}} are {{the cause}} of failure or poor performance {{in a wide variety}} of electrical devices. For example, corroded jumper cable clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a <b>fuse</b> or its <b>holder</b> can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.|$|R

25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} <b>fuse</b> in its <b>holder,</b> or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} the fiber-optic coupling and light transfer system of the WISDOM (WIYN Spectrograph for DOppler Monitoring) instrument. As a next-generation Precision Radial Velocity (PRV) spectrometer, WISDOM incorporates lessons learned from HARPS about thermal, pressure, and gravity control, but also takes new measures to stabilize the spectrograph illumination, a subject that has been overlooked until recently. While fiber optic links provide more even illumination than a conventional slit, careful engineering of the interface is required to realize their full potential. Conventional round fiber core geometries have been used successfully in conjunction with optical double scramblers, but such systems still retain a memory of the input illumination that is visible in systems seeking sub-m/s PRV precision. Noncircular fibers, along with advanced optical scramblers, and careful optimization of the spectrograph optical system itself are therefore necessary to study Earth-sized planets. For WISDOM, we have developed such a state-of-the-art fiber link concept. Its design is driven primarily by PRV requirements, but it also manages to preserve high overall throughput. Light from the telescope is coupled into a set of six, 32 μm diameter octagonal core fibers, as high resolution is achieved via pupil slicing. The low-OH, step index, fused silica, FBPI-type fibers are custom designed for their numerical aperture that matches the convergence of the feeding beam and thus minimizes focal ratio degradation at the output. Given the demanding environment at the telescope the fiber end tips are mounted in a custom <b>fused</b> silica <b>holder,</b> providing a perfect thermal match. We used a novel process, chemically assisted photo etching, to manufacture this glass fiber holder. A single ball-lens scrambler is inserted into the 25 m long fibers. Employing an anti-reflection (AR) coated, high index, cubic-zirconia ball lens the alignment of the scrambler components are straightforward, as the fiber end tips (also AR coated) by design touch the ball lens and thus eliminate spacing tolerances. A clever and simple opto-mechanical design and assembly process assures micron-level self-alignment, yielding a ~ 87 % throughput and a scrambling gain of > 20, 000. To mitigate modal noise the individual fibers then subsequently combined into a pair of rectangular fibers, providing a much larger modal area thanks to the 34 x 106 micron diameter. To minimize slit height, and thus better utilize detector area, the octagonal cores are brought very close together in this transition. The two outer fibers are side polished at one side, into a D-shaped cladding, while the central fiber has a dual side polish. These tapered, side-flattening operations are executed with precise alignment to the octagonal core. Thus the cores of the 3 fibers are brought together and aligned within few microns of each other before spliced onto the rectangular fiber. Overall throughput kept high and FRD at bay by careful management of fiber mounting, vacuum feed-through, application of efficient AR coatings, and implementation of thermal breaks that allow for independent expansion of the fibers and the protective tubing...|$|R
5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and <b>fuse</b> block, lamp <b>holders,</b> key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|R
50|$|Traditional diazed fuse holders {{are made}} as a {{conducting}} metal envelope covered with non-conducting porcelain cover. Under mechanical stress {{it is possible for}} the cover to crack partially or fully, uncovering the conducting element. It may happen if a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> was accidentally dropped or someone was using too much force to screw it in. Uncovered metal envelopes present a serious risk of shock and should be replaced immediately under extreme precautions by trained personnel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> on a cutout {{can also}} be {{replaced}} with a mechanism designed {{to function as a}} sectionalizer, to be used on a distribution line downstream from autoreclosing circuit breakers. Autoreclosers sense and briefly interrupt fault currents, and then automatically reclose to restore service. Meanwhile, downstream sectionalizers automatically count current interruptions by the recloser. When a sectionalizer detects a preset number of interruptions of fault current (typically 3 or 4) the sectionalizer opens (while unenergized) and remains open, and the recloser restores supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{consisted}} of a large cylindrical main body containing a 60 mm mortar shell linked by a steel tube to a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> which held either a pressure fuse or a pull fuse for use with tripwires. A rectangular thin metal plate positioned halfway up {{the main body of}} the mine provides additional support. When the fuse is triggered, a flash travels along the steel tube to the base of the main body, where it ignites a 0.8 g black powder charge, launching the mortar shell from the mine and igniting a pyrotechnic delay.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> {{typically}} has an attached {{pull ring}} {{that can be}} engaged by a hook {{at the end of}} a fiberglass hot stick operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a bucket truck, to manually open the switch. While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load. For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a [...] "load break" [...] version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.|$|E
5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} button {{retained by}} a thin wire, {{which serves as a}} [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator. When the fuse blows, the wire breaks and the indicator button is ejected by the spring. A missing or displaced indicator thus pinpoints a blown fuse. The removable part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> has a small window to allow inspection of the indicator without removal of the fuse. The indicator button usually has a coloured dot indicating the fuse rating (see table).|$|E
5000|$|The {{smaller end}} cap (the [...] "top" [...] of the bottle) has a {{diameter}} that {{varies with the}} fuse rating: higher ratings have wider end caps. The fixed part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> contains a (usually colour-coded) gauge ring, which will accept end caps {{up to a certain}} diameter. It is therefore not possible to fit a fuse of a higher rating than allowed for by the gauge ring. The size of the gauge ring is determined by the current rating of the circuit to be protected. Gauge rings are intended to be changed only by authorized personnel.|$|E
