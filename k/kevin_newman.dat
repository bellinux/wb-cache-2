The pairing of Gibson and McRee fared well in the ratings. However, ratings sharply declined when Gibson also left the show to make way for <b>Kevin</b> <b>Newman</b> on May 1, 1998.

25|$|At its June 2010 launch announcement, Sun News {{respectively}} named David Akin and Brian Lilley {{as national}} bureau chief and senior correspondent; both men serve as on-air hosts. Sun News' first significant on-air hire was nationally syndicated {{talk show host}} Charles Adler; the Winnipeg-based Adler was named in September 2010 to host a nightly analysis/opinion show on the network (Adler's titular show was cancelled in September 2013, following the host's on-air chat with Kory Teneycke). Two more significant hires took place in October 2010, when Sun News hired longtime CBC News reporter Krista Erickson to serve as host and reporter, while also hiring author, columnist and Western Standard founder Ezra Levant to host a late-afternoon analysis show. During the summer of 2010, Sun News made an overture to comedian Rick Mercer (who declined), while also denying rumours of an offer to <b>Kevin</b> <b>Newman,</b> who left his anchor position at Global National that August and is currently a host for CTV News Channel. Theo Caldwell was also tapped to host a business-oriented afternoon show, but was quickly dropped {{in the summer of}} 2011 and replaced by Michael Coren.|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times Rosenthal {{described}} the episode as [...] "wrenching" [...] and a [...] "powerful piece". He says {{the focus of}} the episode is whether Simone's transplant took and that the episode downplayed policework, while highlighting the interpersonal. He noted that the performance made Simone an Emmy Award favorite. [...] He notes that a lot of emotions are displayed by Simone's colleagues and that the episode also has a meaningful secondary storyline in which Sipowicz shows volatility in the face of [...] "Simone's uncertain health and the reappearance of his alcoholic ex-wife". <b>Kevin</b> <b>Newman</b> of ABC's Good Morning America {{described the}} finale as [...] "very touching" [...] and noted that Smits, himself, claimed to have warned his own mother not to watch because it would be [...] "too emotional".

500|$|On August 7, 2005, {{just after}} 11:30p.m. EDT, Charles Gibson broke into local {{news in the}} eastern U.S. and regular {{programming}} on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from lung cancer. He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. [...] "Peter, {{of the three of}} us, was our prince," [...] said Brokaw on Today. [...] "He seemed so timeless. He had such élan and style." [...] Canada's television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings' death and had remembrances from their [...] "big three" [...] anchors, Peter Mansbridge at the CBC, Lloyd Robertson at CTV, and <b>Kevin</b> <b>Newman</b> (himself a former colleague of Jennings at ABC) at Global.|$|E

500|$|Within a {{few weeks}} Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent, Marc Korman. Korman phoned Salke, calling the script [...] "remarkable" [...] and praising Killen: [...] "...for {{a guy who has}} never written a {{procedural}} show in his life", he was [...] "making two cases work." [...] Initially, Salke and Korman hoped to sell acquisition rights to other networks (including Fox). Although it successfully made its way into the lower executive branches of the company, the script was ultimately declined by Fox entertainment president <b>Kevin</b> Reilly.

But, a gifted teacher, {{he said he could}} teach the necessary skills to anyone in two weeks. He also had speaking roles in many television series and films, to include the 1959 film The Oregon Trail, in which his expertise as a gunhandler, fastdraw artist, and instructor were shown.

40|$|Oxygen {{homeostasis}} {{is essential}} for the development and normal physiology of an organism. Hypoxia causes the mitochondrial electron transport chain to generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species resulting in oxidative stress. Hypoxia can be a direct consequence of hypoperfusion, a common vascular component among Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors, and may {{play an important role in}} AD pathogenesis. Beta-site amyloid-β A 4 precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1) is responsible, with γ-secretase, for cleavage of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) to produce amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. A recent study observed that oxidative stress increases BACE 1 expression via a regulatory pathway dependent on γ-secretase cleavage of AβPP and this increases Aβ peptide production. Zebrafish embryos represent normal cells in which complex and subtle manipulations of gene activity can be performed to facilitate analysis of genes involved in human disease. Here we identify and describe the expression of bace 1, the zebrafish ortholog of human BACE 1. We observe that the zebrafish AD-related genes bace 1, psen 1, psen 2, appa, and appb all show increased mRNA levels under hypoxia. A dominant negative form of psen 1 putatively blocking γ-secretase activity blocks bace 1 upregulation under hypoxia. Hypoxia increases catalase gene mRNA indicating increased oxidative stress but we did not observe increased levels of F 2 -isoprostanes that indicate peroxidation of arachidonic acid, possibly due to relatively low levels of arachidonic acid in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that upregulation of PSEN 1 & 2, AβPP and the γ-secretase-dependent upregulation of BACE 1 is an ancient, conserved, and thus selectively advantageous response to hypoxia/oxidative stress.
