25|$|BMP-3F – Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the running engine.|$|E

A cylindrical capacitor ion counter is described which has a flexible computerized control system, to allow selection of ion mobility by changing the bias voltage across the capacitor.

Measurements of air ions using the device in current and voltage decay modes show consistent results. The collecting electrode is exposed directly in the air stream to be sampled, eliminating diffusive losses in <b>intake</b> <b>tubes.</b> The system can measure ion concentrations from 20 ions cm- 3 (including typical atmospheric concentrations) and can sample ions rapidly.

50|$|The <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> {{takes in}} air and mixes it with fuel to combust, and also {{controls}} {{the expulsion of}} exhaust gas, like a valve, limiting the flow but not stopping it altogether. While the fuel-air mixture burns, most of the expanding gas is {{forced out of the}} exhaust pipe of the engine. Because the intake tube(s) also expel gas during the exhaust cycle of the engine, most valveless engines have the intakes facing backwards so that the thrust created adds to the overall thrust, rather than reducing it.|$|E
50|$|An <b>intake,</b> or <b>tube,</b> {{is needed}} {{in front of the}} {{compressor}} to help direct the incoming air smoothly into the moving compressor blades.

5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper <b>intake</b> <b>tubes</b> running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} air-flow {{within the}} stock intake tubing between the throttle plate and airbox {{has also been}} maximised.

5000|$|The valveless pulsejet is {{not really}} valveless [...] - [...] it just uses the mass of air in the <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> as its valve, {{in place of a}} {{mechanical}} valve.

In all known successful valveless pulsejet designs, the intake air mass is {{a small fraction of the}} tailpipe air mass (due to the smaller dimensions of the intake duct). This means that the intake air mass will be cleared out of contact with the body of the engine faster than the tailpipe mass will. The carefully designed imbalance of these two air masses is important for the proper timing of all parts of the cycle.|$|E

5000|$|Garrett Morgan {{invented a}} safety hood smoke {{protection}} device after seeing firefighters struggling from the smoke they {{encountered in the}} line of duty. His device used a wet sponge to filter out smoke and cool the air. It also took advantage of the way smoke and fumes tend to rise to higher positions while leaving a layer of more breathable air below, by using an air <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> that dangled near the floor. The safety hood used a series of tubes to draw clean air off the lowest level the tubes could extend to. Smoke, being hotter than the air around it, rises, and by drawing air from the ground, the Safety Hood provided the user with a way to perform emergency respiration. He filed for a patent on the device in 1912, and founded a company called the National Safety Device Company in 1914 to market it. He was able to sell his invention around the country, sometimes using the tactic of having a hired white actor take credit rather than revealing himself as its inventor. For demonstrations of the device, he sometimes adopted the disguise of [...] "Big Chief Mason", a purported full-blooded Indian from the Walpole Island Indian Reserve in Canada. He would demonstrate the device by building a noxious fire fueled by tar, sulfur, formaldehyde and manure inside an enclosed tent. Disguised as Big Chief Mason, he would enter the tent full of black smoke, and would remain there for 20 minutes before emerging unharmed.|$|E
50|$|Throttle-body fuel {{injection}} first appeared for the 302 on the Lincoln Continental in 1980, and was made standard on all applications in 1983 except manual-transmission equipped Mustangs, Mercury Capris (equipped first with two-barrel (1982), then later four-barrel carburetor (1983-85)), and F-series trucks. The block was fitted with revised, taller lifter bosses to accept roller lifters, and a steel camshaft in 1985, and electronic sequential {{fuel injection}} {{was introduced in}} 1986. While sequential injection was used on the Mustang beginning in 1986, many other vehicles, including trucks, continued to use a batch-fire fuel injection system. The speed-density based EFI systems used a large, two-piece, cast-aluminum manifold. It was fitted on all engines through 1988, after which year it was phased out for a mass-air type measuring system in most applications (non-California compliant Panther platform cars retained the speed-density system until the Lincoln Town Car received the Modular V8 for model year 1991, and the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis for 1992). The same manifold was used in MAF applications, {{with the addition of}} the MAF sensor in the air <b>intake</b> <b>tube.</b> The MAF system continued, with minor revisions, until the retirement of the engine in 2001. Ford offered a performance head that was a stock part on 1993-1995 Mustang Cobra models and pre- 1997-1/2 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers equipped with the 5.0 L engine called the GT-40 head (casting ID F3ZE-AA). In mid-1997, the Explorer and Mountaineer 5.0 L heads were revised and renamed GT40P. The GT40P heads, unlike the GT40 heads, had a very well-developed port shape/design which yielded about 200 cfm on the intake side and 140 cfm on the exhaust side without increasing the size of the ports at all from standard E7TE castings, and without increasing the exhaust valve size. They also had smaller 59-61 cc combustion chambers for added compression, and the combustion chamber shape was revised to put the spark plug tip {{near the center of the}} chamber for a more even burn. These GT40P heads are considered by many enthusiasts to be extremely efficient.|$|E

Major causes include severe motility disorders and limited resorption surface in the small intestine. HPN is a lifesaving therapy but has severe consequences on daily life. The aim {{of this study was to}} make an inventory of the problems experienced by patients receiving HPN. METHODS: Open interviews were held with 48 patients from the 2 major centers for HPN in the Netherlands, centered around the question: Which 3 HPN problems have the most severe impact on your daily life? Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The respondents mentioned 7 central problems: negative emotions, physical problems, social limitations, dependence on others, incapability, complications, and patient-care provider problems. In addition, practical problems were mentioned: sleeping problems, financial problems, and the "hospital atmosphere" at home. The latter issues formed less of a problem for the patients. CONCLUSION: The main underlying elements in the lives of many HPN patients appeared to be loss, longing, and grief.

40|$|Several {{initiatives}} are currently emerging {{to observe the}} exchange of energy and matter between the earth's surface and atmosphere standardized over larger space and time domains. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) are set to provide the ability of unbiased ecological inference across ecoclimatic zones and decades by deploying highly scalable and robust instruments and data processing. In the construction of these observatories, enclosed infrared gas analyzers are widely employed for eddy covariance applications. While these sensors represent a substantial improvement compared to their open- and closed-path predecessors, remaining high-frequency attenuation varies with site properties and gas sampling systems, and requires correction. Here, we show that components of the gas sampling system can substantially contribute to such high-frequency attenuation, but their effects can be significantly reduced by careful system design. From laboratory tests we determine the frequency at which signal attenuation reaches 50  % for individual parts of the gas sampling system. For different models of rain caps and particulate filters, this frequency falls into ranges of 2. 5 – 16. 5  Hz for CO 2, 2. 4 – 14. 3  Hz for H 2 O, and 8. 3 – 21. 8  Hz for CO 2, 1. 4 – 19. 9  Hz for H 2 O, respectively. A short and thin stainless steel <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> was found to not limit frequency response, with 50  % attenuation occurring at frequencies well above 10  Hz for both H 2 O and CO 2. From field tests we found that heating the <b>intake</b> <b>tube</b> and particulate filter continuously with 4  W was effective, and reduced the occurrence of problematic relative humidity levels (RH [*]>[*] 60  %) by 50  % in the infrared gas analyzer cell. No further improvement of H 2 O frequency response was found for heating in excess of 4  W. These laboratory and field tests were reconciled using resistor–capacitor theory, and NEON's final gas sampling system was developed on this basis. The design consists of the stainless steel <b>intake</b> <b>tube,</b> a pleated mesh particulate filter and a low-volume rain cap in combination with 4  W of heating and insulation. In comparison to the original design, this reduced the high-frequency attenuation for H 2 O by [*]≈[*] 3 ∕ 4, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3  %, even at high relative humidity (95  %). The standardized design can be used across a wide range of ecoclimates and site layouts, and maximizes practicability due to minimal flow resistance and maintenance needs. Furthermore, due to minimal high-frequency spectral loss, it supports the routine application of adaptive correction procedures, and enables largely automated data processing across sites...|$|E
40|$|Improving year-round data {{coverage}} for CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes in the Arctic {{is critical for}} refining the global C budget but continuous measurements are very sparse due to the remote location limiting instrument maintenance, to low power availability, and to extreme weather conditions. The need for tailoring instrumentation, site set up, and maintenance at different sites can add uncertainty to estimates of annual C budgets from different ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the influence of different sensor combinations on fluxes of sensible heat, CO 2, latent heat (LE), and CH 4, and assessed the differences in annual CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes estimated with different instrumentation at the same sites. Using data from four sites across the North Slope of Alaska, we found that annual CO 2 fluxes estimated with heated (7. 5 +/- 1. 4 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) and non-heated (7. 9 +/- 1. 3 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) anemometers were within uncertainty bounds. Similarly, despite elevated noise in 30 -min flux data, we found that summer CO 2 fluxes from open (- 17. 0 +/- 1. 1 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) and close-path (- 14. 2 +/- 1. 7 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) gas analyzers were not significantly different. Annual CH 4 fluxes were also within uncertainty bounds when comparing both open (4. 5 +/- 0. 31 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) and closed-path (4. 9 +/- 0. 27 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) gas analyzers as well as heated (3. 7 +/- 0. 26 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) and non-heated (3. 7 +/- 0. 28 gC m(- 2) yr(- 1)) anemometers. A continuously heated anemometer increased data coverage (64 %) relative to non-heated anemometers (47 - 52 %). However, sensible heat fluxes were over-estimated by 12 %, on average, with the heated anemometer, contributing to the overestimation of CO 2, CH 4, and LE fluxes (mean biases of 0. 03 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1), 0. 05 mgC m(- 2) h(- 1), and 3. 77 W m(- 2), respectively). To circumvent this potential bias and reduce power consumption, we implemented an intermittent heating strategy whereby activation only occurred when ice or snow blockage of the transducers, was detected. This resulted in comparable coverage (50 %) during winter to the continuously heated anemometer (46 %), while avoiding flux over-estimation. Closed and open-path analyzers showed good agreement, but data coverage was generally greater when using closed-path, especially during winter. Winter data coverage of 26 - 32 % was obtained with closed-path devices, vs 10 - 14 % for the open-path devices with unheated anemometers or up to 46 % and 35 % using closed and open-path analyzers, respectively with heated anemometers. Accurate estimation of LE remains difficult in the Arctic due to strong attenuation in closed-path systems, even when <b>intake</b> <b>tubes</b> are heated, and due to poor data coverage from open-path sensors in such a harsh environmen...|$|R
