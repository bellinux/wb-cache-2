The effect of rotor imbalance on the stability of rotor systems is examined, and it is shown that time transient orbits of shaft and support motions clearly indicate their dynamic behavior for both stable and unstable operating speeds. Simple design criteria are proposed for choosing the support stiffness and damping on the basis of rotor weight and journal clearance to promote optimum stability. It is concluded that the use of a flexible damped support system may increase the stability threshold of a plain journal bearing and that damper supports should promote smoother and quieter machine operation by suppressing oil whirl and attenuating unbalanced rotational forces...|$|R

An appreciation of these limitations is particularly {{significant for the}} development of new generation, high performance machinery in which new materials, rotor supports, coupling components, and sophisticated control systems will be used.

40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 26 This paper {{explains}} how synchronous rotor instability {{can occur in}} high speed turbomachinery due to differential heating of bearing journals. Theoretical investigations have indicated that rotors supported by <b>fluid-film</b> <b>bearings</b> inherently exhibit a nonuniform temperature distribution around the bearing journal circumference (Keogh and Morton, 1993, 1994). This thermal effect results in rotor bending, which in combination with an overhung mass, such as couplings and overhung impellers, can significantly increase rotor unbalance and thus, synchronous rotor vibration. Under certain conditions, it can even lead to synchronous rotor instability. In this paper, a case history on synchronous rotor instability is presented, concerning two pipeline compressors for a natural gas application. The compressors successfully passed an API 617 mechanical running test in the manufacturer's workshop. However, installed at site, the rotor behavior of these machines was completely unstable. The vibration analysis indicated {{that the cause of}} the instability was likely to be thermal in origin. However, ordinary labyrinth seal rubbing could be excluded. One of the compressor cartridges was returned to the manufacturer's workshop for a detailed examination and an extensive test program. It appeared that rotor instability was caused by differential heating of the impeller-end bearing journal, which could not be reduced by modification of the bearing parameters. Eventually, a heat barrier sleeve was designed to prevent thermal bending of the rotor at this location. Additional testing confirmed the expected effect and, after installation in the field, the unstable behavior of both machines was completely eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer modelling {{investigation of the}} dynamic behaviour of rotors supported by hydrodynamic bearings. The rotor is discretized into finite elements. The <b>fluid-film</b> <b>bearings</b> are represented by non-linear forces that are linearized in the neighbourhood of the static equilibrium position, Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} modelling of impacts between rotor discs and their casings, for which two approaches are used, namely (i) Newton's impact theory and (ii) direct determination of contact forces using a contact stiffness. In the first approach, the discs are assumed to be connected to the shaft by spring elements. The discs and the stationary part are considered to be absolutely rigid. Velocity components of the discs after the impact are calculated using the law of conservation of the momentum and moment of momentum. Dissipation of mechanical energy during impact is taken into account through the coefficient of restitution. In the second approach local flexibility and damping in the contact area are assumed. Local deformation produces impact forces and moments acting on the shaft at the disc location. In both cases, Coulomb friction is assumed to act in the contact area. A modified form of the Newmark method was applied to solve the resulting non-linear equations of motion. Both apl,roaches make it possible to characterize the steady state forced vibration behaviour (periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic). In addition, the second approach provides further information on the likely magnitude and time history of the impact forces, duration of impacts, etc. The two approaches are illustrated by examples involving imbalance excitation anti kinematic excitation of the baseplate...|$|R
40|$|UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a production-level optical {{polishing}} process {{consisting of}} a moving belt that is pressed into an optical surface by a carrier wheel. The current configuration is comprised of a cylindrical carrier wheel attached to cylindrical roller bearings. As the optics market is moving towards aspheric geometry with smaller radii of curvature, geometric limitations associated with roller bearings requires {{the development of a}} modified approach to the UFF process. This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical <b>fluid-film</b> <b>bearings</b> were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the feed hole and to account for pressure drops in the bearing fluid supply system. Both bearing configurations predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady load and speed. Performance tests on the UFF were completed with both bearing configurations under steady load and speed. Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial load and speed application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period. The hydrostatic bearing operated successfully over a wide range of applied loads and speeds employed in the current UFF process with minimal cup and ball wear. The feasibility of the hydrostatic spherical bearing element in the UFF process was subsequently demonstrated through the generation of repeatable and acceptable removal function maps which were then employed in the polishing of a planar optical surface...|$|R
40|$|Vibration induced {{hot spots}} in radial fluid film {{bearings}} can cause spiral vibrations. The phenomenon {{is known as}} Morton effect. Various authors have described the phenomenon of spiral vibrations caused by rubbing in general [1 - 4] and specifically by the differential viscous shearing in fluid film bearings [5 - 8]. The history of {{the case of a}} turbo-expander for the cryogenic industry is described. The investigated machine has a single relatively stiff rotor with two overhung impellers. The rotor is supported on two tilting pad bearings, as they are commonly used for these applications. It was designed in line with API 617 7 th edition [11]. During internal factory testing excessive vibration at high speed suddenly developed, in spite of very high damping and comfortable separation margins of the relevant rotor vibration modes. The vibrations evolution in a polar plot had the appearance of a spiral, as they are typically observed in case of vibration induced hot spots. The tilting pad bearings were suspected as the most likely cause for the hot spots. In parallel to the tests, hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the turbo-expander were carried out. The applied method, introduced by Schmied [5] allows the handling of general rotor systems. The hot spot model is based on the theory of Kellenberger [3] using a thermal equation between the shaft’s thermal deflection and the shaft displacement at the hot spot location. The analytical results gave evidence of the instabilities and confirmed the <b>fluid-film</b> <b>bearings</b> as the source of the hot spot. The model was used to assess changes for the solution of the problem. The following measures were studied: Reduction of the oil viscosity, stiffening of the rotor and reduction of the bearing width.

40|$|LecturePg. 105 - 130 As {{a result}} of a {{continuing}} demand for increased performance, modern turbomachines are sometimes designed to operate near a critical speed. Machines for petrochemical and natural gas service have been purchased and delivered which were later discovered to be operating so close to a critical speed as to cause difficulty in maintaining the rotor balance required to ensure acceptable vibration levels. A serious requirement for an accurate critical speed prediction capability is thus indicated. Field experience has shown that the accuracy of computer predicted critical speeds of contemporary turbomachines is sometimes open to question. Reports on research to experimentally verify existing computer programs for a priori critical speed prediction are almost nonexistent in the engineering literature. Comparisons of state-of-the-art computer predictions of critical speeds are described herein, with experimental measurements on shafts and rotors of varying complexity. The models investigated range from a precision uniform shaft in the laboratory to an eight-stage centrifugal compressor rotor. Modifications made to existing computer programs to improve the accuracy of predicted critical speeds are also discussed. Special care must be taken to properly define the rotor-mass elastic model, which depends on the features of the computer program employed. The accuracy of critical speed predictions is shown to depend on: 1) the accuracy of the free-free rotor vibration models, which depends on the accuracy of the rotor mass-elastic model, once the computer algorithm is optimized, 2) the accuracy of the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients, which are speed dependent in the case of <b>fluid-film</b> <b>bearings,</b> and 3) the accuracy of the dynamic properties of the foundation, which can be represented by a frequency-dependent impedance and which must be determined by experimental measurements. In the special case of tilt-pad bearings, existing data on the stiffness properties was found to be unsatisfactory. Measurements were made and the new results are reported herein. Measurements made on one of the laboratory models, a three-disk rotor on tilt-pad bearings, showed subsynchronous whirl, which is not explainable by contemporary instability theory unless the tilt-pad bearings have significant cross-coupling and less damping than the available literature predicts...|$|R
