A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E

5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> and dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E

5|$|Long range {{forecasts}} {{brought the}} storm near Bermuda. However Debby remained over 900mi (1,450km) {{from the island}} at its closest approach. Though the storm was forecast to remain far away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, investors tracking the storm caused {{the price of crude}} oil to rise 60cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{detached}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico by barrier islands, San Antonio Bay {{does not}} support a large shipping industry. The only port of merit on the bay is Seadrift, where a shipping channel has been dredged to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

25|$|On 4 June 2006, Khamenei {{said that}} Iran would disrupt energy {{shipments}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persian <b>Gulf</b> region (about 20% of the world's daily supply of oil passes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persian <b>Gulf</b> through <b>the</b> Strait of Hormuz {{very close to}} Iran's coast) should the country come under attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US, insisting that Tehran will not give up its right to produce nuclear fuel.|$|R
5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{and their}} remnants, move into New Mexico {{from both the}} eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Although Atlantic Basin {{tropical}} cyclones are more unusual events, the rainfall record for New Mexico was from a tropical depression which moved across Texas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico in October 1954.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E
5000|$|Bodrum, {{located in}} its {{northwest}} reaches, {{is the only}} large city on <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> today. In ancient times, alongside Halicarnassus (modern-day Bodrum), the city of Ceramus, located midway along <b>the</b> <b>gulf's</b> northern shore and after which <b>the</b> <b>gulf</b> was named, was also an important urban center. Across Ceramus (Gereme) (in the modern township of [...] ), at a short distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>gulf's</b> southern shore and not far from its outlying waters, was another historical site of note, called Cedrae in ancient times. Cedrae was located in Sedir Island, which was prized by visitors for its beach and of which some remains still exist.|$|R

5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
5|$|FSU Panama City began {{offering}} full-time daytime programs in fall 2000. This scheduling, coupled with programs {{offered in the}} evenings, serves to accommodate the needs of its diverse student population. Over 30 resident faculty were hired to help staff the programs. Nestled among oaks along the waters of North Bay and only three miles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, the Florida State University Panama City campus offers upper-division undergraduate courses {{as well as some}} graduate and specialist degree programs.|$|E

5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|The Log {{from the}} Sea of Cortez is the {{narrative}} portion of an unsuccessful earlier work, Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research, {{which was published}} by Steinbeck and Ricketts shortly after their return <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of California, and combined the journals of the collecting expedition, reworked by Steinbeck, with Ricketts' species catalogue. After Ricketts' death in 1948, Steinbeck dropped the species catalogue from the earlier work and republished it with a eulogy to his friend added as a foreword.|$|E
