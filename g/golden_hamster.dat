25|$|Initially, {{the role}} of CKIε within the {{circadian}} clock of mammals was discovered {{as the result of}} a mutation in hamsters. The tau mutation in the Syrian <b>golden</b> <b>hamster</b> was the first to show a heritable abnormality of circadian rhythms in mammals. Hamsters with the mutation exhibit a shorter period than the wild-type. Heterozygotes have a period of about 22h while the period of homozygotes is even shorter, at about 20h. Because of previous research indicating {{the role of}} dbt in establishing period, the tau mutation was found to be at the same locus as the CKIε gene. Thus, this mutation relates to the mutations dbtS and dbtL, which both effect the internal period of the fly. However, it seems that the forces driving these changes in period are different. It was found that the point mutation resulting in the tau mutant decreased the activity of the CKIε kinase in vitro. In flies, on the other hand, the dbtL mutation is associated with a decrease in dbt activity and a longer period. This is consistent with another experiment done on hamsters that showed a lengthening of the period caused by CKI inhibition. To investigate this discrepancy, researchers studied the half-life of PER2 under the influence of wild-type CKIε, CKIεtau, and CKIε (K38A) which is a kinase-inactive mutant. The results indicated that the tau mutation was actually a gain-of-function mutation, instead of loss-of-function, that caused the more rapid degradation of the PER proteins. Therefore, the tau mutation in hamsters can be seen as similar to mutations in dbt that change the internal period.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of their {{widespread}} popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature include the short story [...] "Pigs Is Pigs" [...] by Ellis Parker Butler, which is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are [...] "pigs" [...] or [...] "pets" [...] for the purpose of determining freight charges. Butler's story, in turn, inspired the [...] episode [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles", written by David Gerrold.

2500|$|Although the Syrian hamster or <b>golden</b> <b>hamster</b> (Mesocricetus auratus) {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by George Robert Waterhouse in 1839, researchers {{were not able}} to successfully breed and domesticate hamsters until 1939. The entire laboratory and pet populations of Syrian hamsters appear to be descendants of a single brother–sister pairing. These littermates were captured and imported in 1930 from Aleppo in Syria by Israel Aharoni, a zoologist of the University of Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, the hamsters bred very successfully. Years later, animals of this original breeding colony were exported to the USA, where Syrian hamsters {{became one of the most}} popular pets and laboratory animals. [...] Comparative studies of domestic and wild Syrian hamsters have shown reduced genetic variability in the domestic strain. However, the differences in behavioral, chronobiological, morphometrical, hematological, and biochemical parameters are relatively small and fall into the expected range of interstrain variations in other laboratory animals.|$|E
2500|$|In the Redwall universe, species almost {{invariably}} (with very few exceptions, including change of character mid-story) determines a creature's nature, whether good or evil. Some common noble species in Redwall include mice, otters, moles, hares, squirrels, hedgehogs, shrews, birds, voles, and badgers, while common vermin include rats, foxes, weasels, ferrets, ravens, snakes, stoats, ermine, sables, wildcats, magpies, rooks, and crows. However, many other varieties of species also make appearances throughout the novels as well. Dormice also appear sometimes but are rarely major characters. On numerous occasions it mentions seals, whose language makes little sense to other creatures; also bank voles on numerous occasions, usually as a [...] "good" [...] character but once as an evil character. Twice, in Mattimeo and Loamhedge, {{there is a}} creature, apparently half weasel and half ferret, called a Wearet, while the book The Rogue Crew features a (purportedly) half weasel and half rat Wearat as its principal villain. Pine martens have been featured in three books, once as the main villain and twice {{in the service of}} a wildcat. Several reptiles are also mentioned, such as adders, other snakes, and lizards. Amphibians like toads and frogs have been featured also, and are depicted as lower creatures that live in more basic tribal systems and usually serve not as the primary villains but as secondary distractions to heroes. There are also some creatures that have only been mentioned once or twice (e.g., wolf, beaver, turtle, whale, wolverine, sable, tortoise, <b>golden</b> <b>hamster,</b> bats, monitor lizards, polecats, and in the first book horses, pigs, dogs and cows). Crows and other corvus birds also appear on numerous occasions, usually being vicious and territorial. Other birds such as owls, herons, red-tailed hawks, and eagles are mentioned, some having major parts in books, including in Mattimeo when a raven named General Ironbeak manages to invade and almost conquers Redwall Abbey.

40|$|Daidzin is {{the major}} active {{principle}} in extracts of radix puerariae, a traditional Chinese medication that suppresses the ethanol intake of Syrian <b>golden</b> <b>hamsters.</b> It is the first isoflavone recognized to have this effect. Daidzin is also a potent and selective inhibitor of human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH- 2). To establish a link between these two activities, we have tested a series of synthetic structural analogs of daidzin. The results demonstrate a direct correlation between ALDH- 2 inhibition and ethanol intake suppression and raise the possibility that daidzin may, in fact, suppress ethanol intake of <b>golden</b> <b>hamsters</b> by inhibiting ALDH- 2. Hamster liver contains not only mitochondrial ALDH- 2 but also high concentrations of a cytosolic form, ALDH- 1, {{which is a very}} efficient catalyst of acetaldehyde oxidation. Further, the cytosolic isozyme is completely resistant to daidzin inhibition. This unusual property of the hamster ALDH- 1 isozyme accounts for the fact we previously observed that daidzin can suppress ethanol intake of this species without blocking acetaldehyde metabolism. Thus, the mechanism by which daidzin suppresses ethanol intake in <b>golden</b> <b>hamsters</b> clearly differs from that proposed for the classic ALDH inhibitor disulfiram. We postulate that a physiological pathway catalyzed by ALDH- 2, so far undefined, controls ethanol intake of <b>golden</b> <b>hamsters</b> and mediates the antidipsotropic effect of daidzin...|$|R
