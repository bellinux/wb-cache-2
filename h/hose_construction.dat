50|$|This house {{displays}} the center-chimney, two-room deep plan typical of mid-18th-century <b>hose</b> <b>construction.</b> In its well-preserved condition it complements the Nehemiah Hubbard House across the street. Together these two houses make the entrance into Laurel Grove Road a pleasing streetscape {{reminiscent of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trend in}} fire <b>hose</b> <b>construction</b> {{over the last}} 20 years has been to use lighter, stronger, lower {{maintenance}} materials. This trend {{is expected to continue}} in the future as new materials and manufacturing methods evolve. One result of this trend has been the introduction of lightweight supply hoses in diameters never possible before. Hoses up to 12 in in diameter with pressure ratings up to [...] are now available. These hoses are expected to find applications in large-scale industrial firefighting, as well as in disaster relief efforts and military operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in <b>hose</b> <b>construction.</b> Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|E

50|$|The {{horizontally}} opposed two-cylinder engine achieved 20 horsepower at 1000 rpm. Bland {{was eager}} to test the engine-powered aircraft before its petrol tank was ready, so she improvised: an empty whisky bottle was used instead, with Bland's deaf aunt's ear trumpet as the engine <b>hose.</b> This <b>construction</b> was not quite a success—the engine's vibrations compromised {{the security of the}} plane's nuts, bolts, and struts, and Bland's flight would have to wait.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to aid in the development of Eaton Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s LifeSense program by developing a hydraulic hose rated for high pressure use but also utilizing the LifeSense technology. Eaton supplied samples of current and newly mixed rubber compounds, which were used in various lab bench testing to determine usable compounds for the hose prototypes. The lab bench tests were completed using an Agilent LCR meter and Dielectric Test Fixture. New capacitance bridge <b>hose</b> <b>construction</b> designs were developed at Purdue, and the materials for the prototype were selected from the list of supplied materials. Selections of materials were made based on prior work done by researchers at Purdue, including Michael McCoy and Timu Gallien. ^ <b>Hose</b> <b>construction</b> was done by Eaton and sample hoses were tested in the lab using an impulse testing chamber. The resistance data was collected in an Excel file and presented to Purdue in graphical form. Only five samples out of two different series of tests did not fail as a result of fittings blown off {{of the end of the}} hose. Furthermore, only one of the five samples produced results as expected, but there was considerable noise present in the data. Ultimately, there was not enough testing to draw conclusive results. The resistance monitoring methods used by Eaton were insufficient to predict failure because the designs are based on a capacitance bridge. It is recommended that, for the advancement of the research, Eaton monitor both capacitance and resistance on future testing. It was also advised that when a sample shows fluctuation in data at mid-life, as seen in some of the results, hoses be removed from test and dissected to determine if the actual cause of fluctuations is a result of the failures trying to be detected. ...|$|E

50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable leather hose to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a leather hose, but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen <b>hose.</b> Its wrapped <b>construction</b> resembled some <b>hoses</b> used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.|$|R
40|$|The {{compounding}} of elastomeric compositions increased hardness for {{the production}} of <b>hoses</b> coiling <b>constructions</b> is worked out. The studies found, that the introduction of technical carbon P 803 in the amount of 105 parts by weight at 100 parts by weight of rubber leads to a slight increase in the viscosity of the rubber composition, hardness and tensile strength, a slight decrease in elongation at break. Introduction of technical carbon P 803 in the amount of 110 parts by weight at 100 parts by weight of rubber results in an increase in the viscosity of the rubber composition, hardness and tensile strength of conventional on 4 %, reduction in elongation at break on 4 %. Introduction of technical carbon P 803 in the amount of 115 parts by weight at 100 parts by weight of rubber results in the increase in the viscosity of rubber mixture on 6 %, the hardness on 13 %, decline of tensile strength and elongation at break on 6 %. Reducing the value of the conditional indicator tensile strength and a significant increase in hardness indicates an excess of carbon content in the rubber composition, the content of carbon technical P 803 therefore optimal 110 parts by weight at 100 parts by weight of rubber. Decline of maintenance of dibutyl phthalate to 8 parts by weight rendered unsatisfactory technological behavior of mixture at roll-forming, that hampered dispergating of ingredients at mixing. Thus we have found that the optimum content of the plasticizer in the rubber mixture of dibutyl phthalate – 10 parts by weight softener and bitumen – 5 parts by weight at 100 parts by weight of rubber...|$|R
5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to <b>hose</b> out red <b>construction</b> paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|R
