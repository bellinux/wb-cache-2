Title of diploma thesis: Development of {{extraction}} procedure for determination of tocopherols In the present work liquid-liquid extraction for determination of alpha, beta, gamma and <b>delta</b> <b>tocopherol</b> from human serum was developed miniaturized. Individual extraction steps as deproteinization, centrifugation, evaporation and final filtration were optimized. Solid supported liquid extraction (SLE) was also tested for determination of tocopherols {{and seems to}} be very promising for use in bioanalysis. During the miniaturization of the {{extraction procedure}} the main emphasis was placed on simplicity, speed and low consumption of samples and solvents. Method was also partly validated. The new extraction process is part of an already developed UHPLC method for the determination of individual forms of tocopherols and will serve to determine the antioxidant capacity of cancer patients during the chemotherapy treatment. Key words: tocopherols, LLE, SLE, biological materia...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical fluid {{extraction}} (SFE) {{has been}} combined with supercritical fluid chromatography SFC) in a preparative mode {{to develop a}} system for fractionating and enriching high value constituents contained in seed oil matrioces. The system consists of an extraction step sequenced on-line with a sorbent filled column, wich permits a SFE-enriched tocoppherol fraction to be diverted onto the chromatographic column for further enrichment of the tocopherols. For the SFE stage the tocopherol enrichment was oprimized at 25 MPa and 80 °C for spybean flakes and rice bran. However, total tocopherol recovery and enrichment was also {{found to be a}} critical function of the mass ratio CO 2 /seed charge. Approximately 60 % of the available tocopherols in spyflakes can be recovered in the SFE step, yielding enrichment factors of 1. 83 - 4. 33 for the four tocfopherol pecies found in soybean oil. Additional enrichment species can be realized in the SFC stage, ranging from 30. 8 for <b>delta</b> <b>tocopherol</b> to 2. 41 for beta tocopherol...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation of {{tocotrienol}} enriched {{corn oil}} was measured for primary oxidative products, lipid hydroperoxides and quantified by peroxide value (PV). Oxidative Stability Index (OSI) {{was used to}} determine the induction period (hrs) by indirect measurement of volatile secondary oxidation products, mainly formic acid. Vitamin E stripped corn oil samples were spiked with individual tocotrienols or tocopherols (collectively, tocols) at concentrations between 100 and 5, 000 ppm. A positive relationship was observed between the concentration of all tocols and inhibition of the formation of secondary products. Gamma tocotrienol (γ-T 3) provided the most protection, with <b>delta</b> <b>tocopherol</b> (δ-T) and delta tocotrienol (δ-T 3) providing similar protection. Alpha tocotrienol (α-T 3) and alpha tocopherol (α-T) followed a similar trend but with diminishing capacity at concentrations higher than 700 ppm. The change in mean daily peroxide value increased as α- tocopherol and α- tocotrienol concentrations increased. When compared against the non-spiked, stripped control oil, both α- tocopherol and α- tocotrienol demonstrated better antioxidant effects at lower concentrations and actually promoted oxidation at concentrations at 700 ppm and above. These effects were not observed with the γ- and δ- tocols. Crude oils from corn kernels, both control and that expressing a homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT) gene, were tested for oxidative stability. No pro-oxidant effects were observed in the modified crude corn oil containing up to 5, 000 ppm tocotrienols (6, 200 ppm total tocotrienols and tocopherols) when compared to the control crude corn oil containing 300 ppm tocotrienols (1, 500 ppm total tocols) ...|$|E
40|$|Moringa {{peregrine}} {{seed oil}} (53. 9 %) was investigated and compared with crude soybean oil. Oils were easily extracted by several solvents but the extraction rate of M. peregrine oil with hexane was slightly faster than of soybean oil. All physicochemical constants but {{free fatty acids}} (%FFA) were lower in M. peregrine oil. The highest transmittance for color measurement was at 575 nm for M. peregrine oil and 600 nm for soybean oil. Total lipids consisted of 90. 5 % and 91. 8 % neutral lipids (NL), 7. 9 % and 5. 5 % glycolipids (GL), and 1. 6 % and 2. 7 % phospholipids (PL), for M. peregrine and soybean oils, respectively, and their fatty acid composition was determined, NL consisted mostly of triacyglycerols in both oils with absence of mono-and diacylglycerols in M. peregrine oil. Separation patterns of GL and PL were nearly identical and at least five phospholipids were identified. Phosphorus levels by nephelometry turbidimetry were 129. 7 and 421. 8 ppm for M. peregrine and soybean oils, respectively. Much lower levels of alpha, gamma and <b>delta</b> <b>tocopherols</b> were present in M. peregrina oil and consequently its oxidative stability was lower during 30 -day incubation period at 100 ºC...|$|R
40|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament fibroblasts {{plays an}} essential role in the organization and maintenance of the connective tissue during development and in response to injuries and diseases. They are also responsible of the migration and differentiation of the variety of cells that takes part in the osteogenesis in response to external forces (1, 2). Age related changes include decreased fibroblasts density and cellular activity which slows orthodontic tooth movement due to prolonged response of the connective tissue to external forces which poses a potential risk in orthodontic treatment (3, 4). Vitamin E had been studied worldwide due to its health benefits in the fields of chronic diseases and ageing such as the anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoporotic effects (5, 6). Vitamin E consists of 2 major isoforms: tocopherols and tocotrienols, each with four distinct analogues (alpha, beta, gamma, and <b>delta).</b> <b>Tocopherols</b> are saturated forms of vitamin E, and tocotrienols are the unsaturated forms, distinguishable by the three double bonds in the tails of tocotrienols (7). Studies showed that tocotrienol is superior for its antioxidant properties as well as increasing cells viability and proliferation (8, 9). The current project aim to evaluate the response of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPdLF) upon exposure to various concentrations of tocotrienols rich fraction (TRF) conditioned medium...|$|R
50|$|Tocotrienols {{are members}} of the vitamin E family: four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, <b>delta)</b> and four <b>tocopherols</b> (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). The {{critical}} chemical structura difference between tocotrienols and tocopherols is in that tocopherols have saturated side chains, whereas tocotrienols have unsaturated isoprenoid side chains (farnesyl isoprenoid tails) with three double bonds (see Figure).|$|R
