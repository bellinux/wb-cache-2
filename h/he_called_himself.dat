Munroe was little known beyond the circle of his personal friends. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> a Federalist of the old school and a Whig, admiring the views of Daniel Webster. He liked music and was an excellent singer. William Munroe, the pencil maker, was a 7th cousin of President James Monroe, the 5th US President.|$|E

Shortly after singer Phil Anselmo joined Pantera, Darrell was invited by Dave Mustaine to join Megadeth. Darrell was willing to join, but {{on the condition that}} Mustaine also hire his brother Vinnie on drums. As Mustaine already had a drummer, Chuck Behler, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera.|$|E

25|$|His first {{published}} works were collections of pieces for musette or hurdy-gurdy, entitled Amusements champêtres (pastoral amusements), published in December 1729. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> 'Chedeville le jeune', and in later compositions referred {{to himself as}} 'Chedeville le cadet'. Another collection of Amusements champêtres followed, which were of a more advanced technical and musical substance. Some variety was found in op. 6, with pieces named after battles and expressing 'war-like images'; it {{was inspired by a}} military campaign he had gone on with the Prince of Conti. He turned briefly to more serious music with Italian influences in op. 7, which is his only collection written specifically for the flute, oboe or violin.|$|E
25|$|The Roman magistrates who {{conquered the}} Greek world were fitted into this tradition; games {{were set up}} in honor of M. Claudius Marcellus, when he conquered Sicily {{at the end of}} the Second Punic War, as the Olympian games were for Zeus; they were kept up for a century and a half until another Roman {{governor}} abolished them, to make way for his own honors. When T. Quinctius Flamininus extended Roman influence to Greece proper, temples were built for him and cities placed his portrait on their coinage; <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> godlike (isotheos) in an inscription at Delphi – but not in Latin, or at Rome. The Greeks also devised a goddess Roma, not worshipped at Rome, who was worshipped with Flamininus (their joint cult is attested in 195 BC); she would become a symbol of idealised romanitas in the later Roman provinces, and a continuing link, whereas a Marcellus or Flamininus might only hold power for a couple years.|$|E
25|$|Their illicit trading {{networks}} disrupted, {{the overseas}} traders banded together against the perceived intensification of the Ming anti-pirate campaign. Wang Zhi {{emerged as the}} leader of the most prominent of these armed bands after Xu Dong exited the scene. The Xu brothers had placed Wang Zhi in charge of their fleets, finances, and foreign contacts, so Wang did not have much trouble taking over the whole syndicate. He settled on the Gotō Islands of Japan after the Ming made him an outlaw. There <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> the King of Hui (徽王) and established good relations not only with the local daimyo Matsura Takanobu, but also with regional hegemons like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōuchi Yoshitaka. Despite his great power, Wang Zhi initially sought to appease the Ming government in hope of getting the maritime prohibitions relaxed, so he turned the rival pirate leaders that he captured over to the authorities. Instead, the Ming authorities tightened the restrictions in 1551, banning even fishing boats from going out to sea. Indignant, Wang Zhi set his pirate fleets upon the Chinese coast.|$|E

25|$|Randy Savage {{had been}} a heel since his WWF debut {{in the summer of}} 1985. He turned babyface in late 1987, after WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man claimed to be the {{greatest}} Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. This led to a feud between Savage and Honky, leading to Savage's face turn. On October 3, 1987 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Savage challenged Honky for the title winning by disqualification. The title remained with Honky because a title cannot change hands by a DQ. Harley Race had won the 1986 King of the Ring tournament and was so proud about this that <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> King Harley Race and wore a crown and cape to the ring. Jim Duggan did not agree with the fact and this placed Duggan and Race into a feud, with Duggan winning most of the matches. Jake Roberts also feuded with Honky Tonk Man after Honky hit a guitar on Roberts on an edition of Snake Pit, completing Roberts' babyface turn. A match was booked for Survivor Series featuring Savage, Roberts, Ricky Steamboat (whom Honky Tonk had defeated to win the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title), Brutus Beefcake and Duggan against Honky, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass and Race.|$|E
500|$|Between 1945 and 1989, Piłsudski's {{person and}} his record {{were one of}} the {{multiple}} topics forbidden by the Polish communist regime. Wandycz characterizes him as [...] "an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. [...] <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> a Polish Lithuanian, and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions." [...] Today, although some aspects of his rule remain controversial, Piłsudski's memory is held in high esteem in Poland. Together with his opponent Roman Dmowski he is regarded as a father of the modern Polish nation.|$|E

The Balšić and Mrnjavčević families, Konstantin Dragaš (maternally a Nemanjić), Vuk Branković and Radoslav Hlapen {{continued}} ruling their respective regions. In addition to Marko, Tvrtko I was crowned King of the Serbs and of Bosnia in 1377 in the Mileševa monastery. Maternally related to the Nemanjić dynasty, Tvrtko had seized western portions of the former Serbian Empire in 1373.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton {{assembled}} a nationwide coalition to garner {{support for the}} Administration, including the expansive financial programs Hamilton had made Administration policy and especially the president's policy of neutrality in the European war between Britain and France. Hamilton's public relations campaign attacked the French minister Edmond-Charles Genêt (<b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Citizen Genêt") who tried to appeal to voters directly, which Federalists denounced as foreign interference in American affairs. If Hamilton's administrative republic was to succeed, Americans had {{to see themselves as}} nation citizens, and experience an administration that proved firm and demonstrated the concepts found within the United States Constitution. The Federalists did impose some internal direct taxes but they departed from the most implications of the Hamilton administrative republic as risky.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut was {{an atheist}} and a humanist, {{serving as the}} honorary {{president}} of the American Humanist Association.

He did not however disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family. Like his great-grandfather Clemens, Vonnegut was a freethinker. He occasionally attended a Unitarian church, but with little consistency. In his autobiographical work Palm Sunday, Vonnegut says he is a [...] "Christ-worshiping agnostic"; {{in a speech to the}} Unitarian Universalist Association, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> a [...] "Christ-loving atheist".

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the name Nihon appears in the Chinese historical records of the Tang dynasty, the Old Book of Tang. At {{the end of the}} seventh century, a delegation from Japan requested that Nihon be used as the name of their country. This name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the official history of the Sui dynasty. Prince Shōtoku, the Regent of Japan, sent a mission to China with a letter in which <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "the Emperor of the Land where the Sun rises" [...] (日出處天子).

In the late 1700s Favre was living near Fort Confederation, but sometime after 1797 moved to St. Stephens. He moved into a house across the road from Augustin Rochon, his future father-in-law. [...] After spending time there and at various other locations along the Tombigbee, Favre returned to Mobile before 1800 where he occupied a house on Loyal Street. While there, he associated with other interpreters including J. B. Roussere and Simon Andry.

He was involved in angles that included purchasing the WWF Championship and paying wrestlers and fans to perform demeaning tasks.

In February 1992, a storyline began in which Jimmy Hart, who had been managing The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon), turned against his team.
