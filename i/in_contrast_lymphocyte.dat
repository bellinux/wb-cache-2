40|$|The {{cellular}} {{events leading}} to proliferation of cultured human lymphocytes after in vitro stimulation with phytomitogens or allogeneic cells are poorly understood. Little is known {{on the nature}} of the proliferating lymphocytes, or whether interactions between different cell types are required for blastogenic transformation of the eventually responding lymphocytes. Investigating these questions, attention has to focus primarily on monocytes, and the different lymphocyte subpopulations. The role of the monocyte (or the monocyte-derived maerophage [1, 2], respectively) in antigen-induced lymphocyte activation continues to be of great interest. Lymphocyte response to many antigens requires the presence of monocytes. Removal of glassadherent cells abolishes the in vitro antibody formation by mouse spleen cells against sheep erythrocytes (3) and antigen-induced transformation of human lymphocytes (4); addition of macrophages restores the lymphocyte reactivity (5, 6). Macrophagelymphocyte interaction is also required for lymphocyte activation by allogeneic histoincompatible lymphocytes in vitro, the mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) 1 (7 - 11). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation by plant mitogens such as phytohemagglutini...|$|E

A substantial proportion of unstimulated T cells from the peripheral blood of patients but not controls expressed HLA-DR; in contrast the IL- 2 and transferrin receptors were rarely expressed spontaneously in either group and {{there was no difference in}} spontaneous lymphocyte transformation.

In order to assess whether anthralin might act via alteration of this growth factor pathway, we examined the in vitro effects of pharmacologic concentrations of anthralin on cultured normal human keratinocytes. Keratinocyte proliferation was inhibited by 98 % at an anthralin concentration of 10 ng/ml, <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation was inhibited by only 50 % at an anthralin concentration of 10 μg/ml. Anthralin treatment did not induce cell-cycle-specific growth arrest as assessed by flow-cytometric analysis of acridine-orange-stained keratinocytes.

Anthralin-treated keratinocytes showed decreased binding of 125 I-EGF and 125 I-IGF-I to their respective receptors, but EGF receptor binding was inhibited to a greater extent. Anthralin decreased ligand-binding affinity and cell-surface numbers of EGF receptors as assessed by Scatchard analysis of 125 I-EGF binding to anthralin-treated keratinocytes.

Two wellknown villages in the suburb of Ramsar Town in the Caspian Sea strip, Taleshmahaleh and Chaparsar,have background radiation that is 13 times higher than normal. This radiation is the result of Radium 226 and Radon gas both of which are highly water soluble. While people living in these regions do not suffer from any major health problems, we decided to study the their immune responses to infection and inflammation in order to determine if their habitat affects their immune defense mechanisms as a way of compensating for their exposure to high dose environmental ionizing radiation. Our results showed that the total serum antioxidant level in the exposed people was significantly lower than the individuals not exposed to high dose natural ionizing radiation.

40|$|In the Azorean rock-pool blenny (Parablennius parvicornis) reproductively active males display {{alternative}} morphotypes, which {{differ in}} the expression of secondary sexual characters (SSC). Males expressing SSC, the M+ morphotype, have high androgen levels and compete for crevices that will be visited by females to spawn. M+ males holding nests court females {{and care for the}} eggs. Males with low expression of SSC, the M− morphotype, have low levels of androgens and reproduce by stealing fertilizations from the M+ males. Based on the hypothesis that androgens are immunosuppressive, we expected these morphotypes to differ in immunocompetence. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a field study in which we collected repeated blood samples to monitor leukocyte populations (blood smears), and to measure the primary antibody response of males that were experimentally challenged with a foreign non-pathogenic antigen (sheep red blood cells). Circulating levels of 11 -ketotestosterone and testosterone were higher in M+ males than in M− males. Neither granulocyte nor thrombocyte counts did covariate with androgens or male tactic. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> counts and humoral antibody response were negatively correlated with body size, and as expected, both were lower in M+ than in M− males. Interestingly, in M+ males androgen levels decreased after immunization, and this was less in nest-holder males than in M+ males that were floating around in the pools. Within each morphotype we found no relationship between androgens and immunocompetence. The latter result is not supportive for androgen regulated immunosuppression in M+ males. A possible alternative is enhancement of immunity in M− males. These males had relatively high levels of injuries in comparison with M+ males. High immunity might be a consequence of high infection rate because of such injuries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{relevance}} of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) {{in breast cancer}} is controversial. Here, we used a tumor microarray including a large series of ductal and lobular breast cancers with long term follow up data, to analyze clinical impact of TIL expressing specific phenotypes and distribution of TILs within different tumor compartments and in different histological subtypes. Methods A tissue microarray (TMA) including 894 ductal and 164 lobular breast cancers was stained with antibodies recognizing CD 4, FOXP 3, and IL- 17 by standard immunohistochemical techniques. Lymphocyte counts were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters and survival. Results CD 4 + lymphocytes were more prevalent than FOXP 3 + TILs whereas IL- 17 + TILs were rare. Increased numbers of total CD 4 + and FOXP 3 + TIL were observed in ductal, as compared with lobular carcinomas. High grade (G 3) and estrogen receptor (ER) negative ductal carcinomas displayed significantly (p + and FOXP 3 + lymphocyte infiltration while her 2 /neu over-expression in ductal carcinomas was significantly (p + TIL counts. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> infiltration was not linked to any clinico-pathological parameters in lobular cancers. In univariate but not in multivariate analysis CD 4 + infiltration was associated with significantly shorter survival in patients bearing ductal, but not lobular cancers. However, a FOXP 3 + /CD 4 + ratio > 1 was associated with improved overall survival even in multivariate analysis (p = 0. 033). Conclusions Ductal and lobular breast cancers appear to be infiltrated by different lymphocyte subpopulations. In ductal cancers increased CD 4 + and FOXP 3 + TIL numbers are associated with more aggressive tumor features. In survival analysis, absolute numbers of TILs do not represent major prognostic indicators in ductal and lobular breast cancer. Remarkably however, a ratio > 1 of total FOXP 3 + /CD 4 + TILs in ductal carcinoma appears to represent an independent favorable prognostic factor. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocyte {{adhesion}} to {{and migration}} across endothelial cell (EC) monolayers, {{derived from the}} rat blood-retinal barrier (BRB), were measured in vitro. The binding of concanavalin A (Con A) -activated peripheral lymph node lymphocytes and the migration of CD 4 + T-cell lines could be significantly increased by treating the EC with interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). To determine the role of various adhesion molecules during the processes of lymphocyte binding and transmonolayer migration (diapedesis), lymphocytes were treated with monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for CD 11 a (alpha L subunit of leucocyte functional antigen- 1; LFA- 1), CD 18 (beta 2 subunit of leucam family) and CD 49 d (alpha 4 subunit of very late activation antigen- 4; VLA- 4) and EC with mAb specific for CD 54 (intercellular adhesion molecule- 1; ICAM- 1) and CD 106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1; VCAM- 1). Binding of the highly adhesive but non-migratory Con A-activated lymphocytes was inhibited by mAb to CD 11 a (reduced to 73 % and 65 % of control lymphocyte adhesion) and CD 18 (42 % and 54 %) on non-activated and IL- 1 beta-treated EC, respectively, but not by mAb to ICAM- 1 or VCAM- 1. Diapedesis of the highly migratory T-cell line lymphocytes was also blocked by antibodies to CD 11 a (reduced to 11 % and 10 % of control T-cell migration), CD 18 (29 % and 43 %) but in addition was also inhibited by anti-ICAM- 1 (17 % and 53 %) on non-activated and IL- 1 beta treated EC, respectively. Both anti-VLA- 4 and anti-VCAM- 1 were also effective in producing a smaller reduction in migration, but only on IL- 1 beta activated EC (66 % and 58 % of control migration, respectively). These studies indicate that lymphocyte adhesion to central nervous system (CNS) vascular EC is largely dependent on LFA- 1 but not through its interaction with ICAM- 1. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> diapedesis is mostly supported through the LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 pairing, with a small proportion being mediated by VLA- 4 /VCAM- 1 on IL- 1 beta-activated EC.

WKC comprises 7 components, including polysaccharides, saponin, flavonoids, and essential oil. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the antitumor and immunomodulatory effects of WKC in a tumor-bearing rodent model. Methods: Male and female Kuming mice weighing ∼ 20 g were subcutaneously implanted with sarcoma 180 (S 180) tumor cells and randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups: oral WKC 175, 350, or 525 mg/kg·d, isotonic saline (negative control), or intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide 25 mg/kg·d (positive control). All treatments were administered daily for 10 days. After euthanization on day 11, the mice, tumors, and spleens were weighed. Lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity were determined using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide cellular viability assay method. Macrophage phagocytosis was identified using a yeast test. Results: Fifty mice were included in the study (10 mice were assigned to each group). The tumors of the mice administered WKC 175, 350, and 525 mg/kg·d were significantly regressed, as determined using MICs, compared with those in the negative-control group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, and P< 0. 01, respectively), and the inhibitory rates were 30. 43 %, 46. 72 %, and 54. 35 %, respectively. Compared with those in the negative-control group, CTL activities and lymphocyte proliferations in the presence of concanavalin A were significantly greater in the WKC-treated groups at all doses (CTL activities: P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, and P< 0. 01, respectively; lymphocyte proliferations: P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, and P< 0. 01, respectively). In the groups receiving WKC 175, 350, and 525 mg/kg·d, the phagocytic rates were 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -fold those in the negative-control group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01, and P< 0. 01, respectively). In the groups receiving WKC 175, 350, and 525 mg/kg·d, the phagocytic indexes were 3. 7 - to 5. 0 -fold those in the negative-control group (all, P< 0. 01). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation in the positive-control group was significantly less compared with that in the negative-control group (P< 0. 01), but no significant differences were found in CTL activities or macrophage phagocytosis between these 2 groups.

The groups consisted of 38 homozygotes for C 282 Y, and 107 heterozygotes for the C 282 Y or compound heterozygotes for C 282 Y and H 63 D. For control purposes, total lymphocyte counts and iron status were also examined in 20 index patients with African dietary iron overload, a condition not associated with HFE mutations, and in 144 members of their families and communities. Mean lymphocyte numbers were lower in C 282 Y homozygous HHC index subjects with cirrhosis and higher iron stores than in those without cirrhosis and with lower iron burdens [(1. 65 +/- 0. 43) x 10 (6) /mL vs. (2. 27 +/- 0. 49) x 10 (6) /mL; p = 0. 008]. Similarly, mean lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in C 282 Y heterozygotes and C 282 Y/H 63 D compound heterozygotes with iron overload and increased serum ferritin concentrations compared to those with normal serum ferritin concentrations (p < 0. 05). Statistically significant negative correlations were found, in males, between lymphocyte counts and the total body iron stores, either in C 282 Y homozygous HHC patients (p = 0. 031 in a multiple regression model dependent on age) and in C 282 Y heterozygotes or C 282 Y/H 63 D compound heterozygotes with iron overload (p = 0. 029 in a simple linear model). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> counts increased with increasing serum ferritin concentrations among the index subjects with African iron overload (r = 0. 324, not statistically significant) and {{among the members of}} their families and communities (r = 0. 170, p = 0. 042). These results suggest that a lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count is associated with a greater degree of iron loading in HFE haemochromatosis but not in African iron overload, and they support the notion that the lymphocyte count may serve as a marker of a non-HFE gene that influences the clinical expression of HFE haemochromatosis...|$|E

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of self-antigens {{has been proposed}} as a therapy to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases. Here we report that oral treatment with insulin prevents virus-induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in a transgenic (tg) mouse model. Such mice express the viral nucleoprotein (NP) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) under control of the rat insulin promoter in their pancreatic beta cells and 95 % of tg mice but not in controls. Oral treatment with 1 mg of insulin twice per week for 2 mo starting either 1 wk before or 10 d after initiating LCMV infection prevents IDDM in > 50 % of the tg mice (observation time 8 mo). Thus, insulin therapy is effective in preventing progression to overt IDDM in prediabetic tg mice with ongoing islet infiltration. Oral {{administration of}} insulin {{does not affect the}} generation of LCMV-NP-specific anti-self cytotoxic T lymphocytes nor the infiltration of lymphocytes into the pancreas. However, less beta cells are destroyed in insulin-treated mice, upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules does not occur, and antiviral (self) cytotoxic T lymphocytes are not found in the islets, events present in tg mice developing IDDM. The majority of lymphocytes in the islets of insulin-treated tg mice without IDDM produces IL- 4, IL- 10, and TGF-beta. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from islets of tg mice developing IDDM mainly make gamma-IFN...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} impaired cellular immune {{responses of}} individuals on chronic hemodialysis by using monoclonal antibodies that trigger differential pathways of T cell activation. Reduced cellular reactivity, which {{exists in a}} high proportion of such patients, can be attributed to a failure of the monocyte population to support the process of primary T cell activation in vitro. This defect results in a lack of interleukin 2 production, which is critically dependent on a monocyte-derived signal. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> T <b>lymphocyte</b> function was found to be physiologic. Perhaps more important, the degree of monocyte dysfunction in vitro correlated with the same patients' in vivo responses to hepatitis B vaccination.

40|$|The {{present study}} shows that the {{distribution}} of T lymphocytes in gastrointestinal carcinomas and their metastases mimic the distribution of T lymphocytes in normal intestine. The composition of the peritumoral reaction resembled that of normal lamina propria with a predominance of CD 3 + CD 4 + T cells. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> located between carcinomatous cells showed phenotypical features {{similar to those of}} intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in normal intestine; in particu(abstractlar they expressed the antigen defined by HML- 1, a monoclonal antibody raised against normal human intestinal IEL which reveals 95 % IEL but very few cells in lymphoid (abstractorgans and blood. As normal intestinal IEL, the majority of intratumoral lymphocytes had the CD 3 + CD 8 + phenotype. A panel of monoclonal antibodies and double immunostaining techniques permitted a better characterisation of minor subsets of IEL. Two subsets of HML 1 + CD 3 + CD 4 - CD 8 - and of HML 1 + CD 3 - cells, representing 2 % and 3 % of normal intestinal IEL respectively, did not significantly increase in carcinomatous epithelium. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>in</b> carcinomatous epithelium, but not in normal intestinal epithelium, we observed the appearance of a few lymphocytes displaying the phenotype of activated T cells (CD 25 +) or of natural killer cells (NKHI+) or of suppressor cells (CD 11 +). Such cells may participate in antitumoral defence. Although a similar population of HML 1 + lymphocytes is associated with normal and carcinomatous intestinal epithelium, some interactions between lymphocytes and epithelial cells may not be maintained in tumoral epithelium. It has previously been shown that HLA-DR expression by enterocytes is modulated by intraepithelial lymphocytes. In our study, no correlation could be shown between the degree of lymphocytic infiltration and the expression of HLA-DR antigens on carcinomatous cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the liver may be a major site of extrathymic T-cell differentiation in mice. In the present study, the ontogeny and subsequent development of such T cells in the liver and other organs were investigated. This study was possible because these T cells have T-cell receptors (TcR) of intermediate intensity (i. e. intermediate TcR cells) and constitutively express {{a high level of}} interleukin- 2 receptor beta chain (IL- 2 R beta). Therefore the two-colour staining for CD 3 (or alpha beta TcR) and IL- 2 R beta identifies even a small proportion of intermediate TcR cells. The total numbers of mononuclear cells obtained from the liver, thymus and spleen varied from foetal to adult life. Especially in the liver, many haematopoietic cells were present in the parenchymal space at the foetal stage. There were no lymphocytes in the sinusoidal lumen at this period. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> appeared <b>in</b> the hepatic sinusoids after birth and increased with ageing. Phenotypic analysis revealed that intermediate TcR cells appeared in the liver and spleen on Day 4 after birth. Bright TcR cells of thymic origin were also present in the peripheral organs on Day 4. Thereafter, intermediate TcR cells increased in the liver, whereas bright TcR cells increased in the periphery as a function of age. Similarly, thymectomized and congenitally athymic mice had mainly intermediate TcR cells in the liver and, to some extent, periphery. It is concluded that intermediate TcR cells, possibly of extrathymic origin, are generated only after birth and expand with ageing...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of leukemogenesis and persistent lymphocytosis (PL; benign expansion of B lymphocytes) in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV; a retrovirus {{closely related to}} human T-cell leukemia virus type 1) is unknown; however, the immune system likely {{plays an important role}} in controlling the outcome of infection. In this study, we compared T-cell competence in serologically positive alymphocytotic (AL) animals with T-cell functions in animals with progressive stages of infection, PL and tumor bearing (TB). Dramatic differences were observed in lymphocyte proliferation to recombinant proteins encoded by BLV gag (p 12, p 15, and p 24) and env (gp 30, and gp 51) genes in different disease stages. Lymphocytes from AL cattle recognized an average of three of five recombinant proteins per animal. Expansion of antigen pulsed lymphocytes in interleukin- 2 increased protein recognition to almost five per animal. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from PL and TB animals failed to recognize any BLV recombinant proteins. Short-term T-cell cultures from the PL group expanded in interleukin- 2, as well as the PL and TB cells cultured in indomethacin (3 to 6 microg/ml), increased the average of recognized proteins per animal to one. Cells proliferating to BLV antigens were CD 4 + T lymphocytes, as shown by cell depletion studies. The positive effect of indomethacin suggests involvement of prostaglandin E 2 as a negative regulatory factor in the later stages of disease. Thus, for the first time, advancing stages of BLV infection were correlated with decreased T-cell competence, providing deeper insight into pathogenesis of retroviral infections...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytes bind to {{high endothelial venule}} (HEV) cells as {{the first}} step in the {{migration}} of these cells into lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer's patches (PP). In this study we isolated and cultured HEV cells from rat LN and investigated the effects of cytokines on the adhesiveness of these cells for lymphocytes. The results showed that lymphocytes from thoracic duct, spleen and LN adhered preferentially to the cultured LN HEV cells compared to cells isolated from the thymus and bone marrow. The adhesiveness of LN HEV cells for thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) was significantly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner by pretreatment of the HEV cells with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or interleukin- 4 (IL- 4). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> pretreatment of HEV cells with IL- 1, IL- 6 or IL- 7 did not alter the capacity of LN HEV cells to adhere lymphocytes. Furthermore, incubation of LN HEV cells with suboptimal doses of TNF and IL- 4, IFN-gamma and IL- 4, or TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma increased significantly the endothelial adhesiveness. Interestingly, although IL- 1 alone did not promote the adhesiveness of HEV cells, the cytokine synergized with suboptimal doses of IL- 4 and TNF-alpha to increase the adhesiveness. The adhesion of TDL to non-stimulated and IL- 4 -stimulated LN HEV cells could be blocked specifically by treatment of lymphocytes with the LN homing-receptor-specific A. 11. 5 monoclonal antibody (mAb). <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> pretreated with the PP-homing receptor-specific 1 B. 2. 6 mAb or the antileucocyte common antigen (OX 1) mAb adhered normally to the HEV cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the baseline and cytokine-stimulated bindings between lymphocytes and LN HEV cells are mediated by adhesive mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte migration into LN in vivo and provide strong evidence that cytokines are central mediators of organ-specific lymphocyte migration...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal metastases {{present a}} major {{clinical}} challenge {{for prostate cancer}} patient care, inflicting distinctive mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions that cause morbidity and refractory skeletal complications. Macrophages are abundant in bone and bone marrow and can influence both osteoblast and osteoclast function in physiology and pathology. Herein, we examined the role of macrophages in prostate cancer bone lesions, particularly the osteoblastic response. First, macrophage and lymphocyte distributions were qualitatively assessed in patient 2 ̆ 7 s prostate cancer skeletal lesions by immunohistochemistry. Second, macrophage functional contributions to prostate tumour growth in bone were explored using an immune-competent mouse model combined with two independent approaches to achieve in vivo macrophage depletion: liposome encapsulated clodronate that depletes phagocytic cells (including macrophages and osteoclasts); and targeted depletion of CD 169 (+) macrophages using a suicide gene knock-in model. Immunohistochemistry and histomorphometric analysis were performed to quantitatively assess cancer-induced bone changes. In human bone metastasis specimens, CD 68 (+) macrophages were consistently located within the tumour mass. Osteal macrophages (osteomacs) were associated with pathological woven bone within the metastatic lesions. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were inconsistently present in prostate cancer skeletal lesions and when detected, had varied distributions. In the immune-competent mouse model, CD 169 (+) macrophage ablation significantly inhibited prostate cancer-induced woven bone formation, suggesting that CD 169 (+) macrophages within pathological woven bone are integral to tumour-induced bone formation. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> pan-phagocytic cell, but not targeted CD 169 (+) macrophage depletion resulted in increased tumour mass, indicating that CD 169 (-) macrophage subset(s) and/or osteoclasts influenced tumour growth. In summary, these observations indicate a prominent role for macrophages in prostate cancer bone metastasis that may be therapeutically targetable to reduce the negative skeletal impacts of this malignancy, including tumour-induced bone modelling.

40|$|The rate of {{cholesterol}} synthesis from [14 C]acetate was low in circulating blood lymphocytes freshly isolated from 17 normal subjects and 4 subjects with homozygous FH.

When the lymphocytes from subjects with all three genotypes were incubated for 48 - 72 h {{in the absence of}} lipoproteins, {{the rate of}} cholesterol synthesis increased by 5 - 15 -fold. The subsequent addition of plasma LDL, but not HDL, rapidly suppressed cholesterol synthesis in the lymphocytes from normal subjects. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from the FH homozygotes, which have been shown previously to be deficient in cell surface LDL receptors, were resistant to LDL-mediated suppression of cholesterol synthesis. In addition to its ability to suppress cholesterol synthesis after it had been elevated by incubation of the cells in the absence of lipoproteins, LDL was able to suppress the induction of the enhanced rate of sterol synthesis when added to normal lymphocytes immediately after their isolation from the bloodstream. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> to the former action of LDL, the latter action of LDL-i. e., the suppression of induction of sterol synthesis-also occurred to a limited extent in lymphocytes from FH homozygotes. However, the FH lymphocytes, but not the normal cells, could be made resistant to this action of LDL by inclusion in the incubation medium of lipoprotein-deficient serum (30 percent, vol/vol) plus HDL (1 mg protein/ml). Considered together with previous data demonstrating a deficiency of LDL receptors in freshly isolated lymphocytes from FH homozygotes, the current studies provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the interaction of plasma LDL with its cell surface receptor serves to regulate cholesterol synthesis in human lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Several {{parameters}} of the cellular and humoral immune responses of chickens infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV-T), an avian defective acute leukemia virus, or with its helper virus, reticuloendotheliosis-associated virus (REV-A), were evaluated. Spleen cells from chickens infected with REV-T (REV-A) or REV-A exhibited depressed mixed lymphocyte and mitogen responses in vitro. Allograft rejection was delayed by 6 to 14 days in birds infected with REV-A. The specific antitumor cell immune response was also studied by a 51 Cr-release cytotoxicity assay. Lymphocytes from chickens infected with low numbers of the REV-T-transformed cells exhibited significant levels of cytolytic reactivity against the 51 Cr-labeled REV-T tumor cells in vitro. The mitogen response of lymphocytes from these injected birds {{was similar to that}} of uninjected chickens. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from chickens injected with higher numbers of REV-T-transformed cells exhibited suppressed mitogen reactivity and failed to develop detectable levels of cytotoxic activity directed against the REV-T tumor cells. These results suggest that the general depression of cellular immune competence which occurs during REV-T (REV-A) infection could {{contribute to the development of}} this acute leukemia by inhibiting the proliferation of cytotoxic cells directed against the tumor cell antigens. The cytotoxic effect observed after the injection of chickens with non-immunosuppressive levels of REV-T-transformed cells appears to be specific for the REV-T tumor cell antigens since cells transformed by Marek's disease virus or avian erythroblastosis virus were not lysed. <b>In</b> marked <b>contrast,</b> birds whose cellular immune responses were suppressed by infection with REV-A were capable of producing a humoral immune response to viral antigens. Detectable levels of viral antibody, however, did not appear until 12 to 15 days after REV-A infection.

We investigated whether lymphocytes carrying or mutations displayed an increased sensitivity to radiation or mitomycin C (MMC) in vitro treatments. Peripheral blood from 21 mutation carriers (12 with BC and 9 healthy), 24 carriers (13 with BC and 11 healthy), 15 familial BC patients without detected mutation in or and 16 controls without familial history of cancer (5 with BC and 11 healthy) were irradiated or treated with MMC.
