5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3, 1900.

In July 1976, two magazines in Argentina and Brazil appeared and published the names of 119 Chilean leftist opponents, claiming they {{had been killed in}} internal disputes unrelated to the Pinochet regime. Both magazines disappeared after this one and only issue. Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia eventually asked Chilean justices to lift Pinochet's immunity in this case, called [...] "Operation Colombo", having accumulated evidence that Pinochet had ordered the DINA to plant this disinformation, in order to cover up the [...] "disappearance" [...] and murder by the Chilean secret police of those 119 persons.

Under terms of the proposal, Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall, would step down from their offices and be granted <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> in the events surrounding the election and Goebel's assassination. The Goebel Election Law would be repealed, and the militia would disperse from Frankfort. Prominent leaders on both sides signed the agreement, but on February 10, 1900, Taylor announced he would not. The legislature convened on February 19, 1900 and agreed to put the election {{in the hands of}} the courts.|$|E
5|$|Democratic Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler {{was on the}} {{investigating}} {{committee and}} {{assumed the role of}} prosecutor when hearings began on March 12, 1924. Jess Smith had engaged in influence peddling before his suicide, conspiring with two other Ohioans, Howard Mannington and Fred A. Caskey, to accept payoffs from alcohol bootleggers to secure either <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> or the release of liquor from government warehouses. Mannington and Caskey's residence became infamous as the Little Green House on K Street. Some witnesses, such as Smith's divorced wife Roxy Stinson, and corrupt former FBI agent Gaston Means, alleged that Daugherty was personally involved. Coolidge requested Daugherty's resignation when the Attorney General indicated that he would not allow Wheeler's committee access to Justice Department records, and Daugherty complied on March 28, 1924.|$|E
5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3. He {{remains the only}} American {{governor}} ever assassinated while in office.

5|$|Meanwhile, on June 13, 1971, The New York Times began {{printing}} {{large portions}} of the Pentagon Papers. The papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the Vietnam War, of which former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public. Ellsberg had {{for a year and}} a half approached members of Congress – such as William Fulbright, George McGovern, Charles Mathias, and Pete McCloskey – about publishing the documents, on the grounds that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution would give congressional members <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution,</b> but all had refused. Instead, Ellsberg gave the documents to the Times.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} indicted in {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E
40|$|This Note explores wives 2 ̆ 7 {{lawsuits}} {{in response}} to male drunkenness between 1850 and 1910. These suits were notable {{in part because of}} the existing common law rule of coverture that denied a woman 2 ̆ 7 s legal existence during marriage. The Note argues that prior to the major waves of temperance reform in the twentieth century, American courts devised creative legal solutions providing relief to wives that reflected the courts 2 ̆ 7 desire to achieve a socially accepted balance between protecting women and upholding male authority within the family. It finds that the courts shaped dram shop, divorce, and dower remedies both to address the incapacity of drunken husbands and to protect male privilege to a certain extent. While scholars have studied how men enjoyed <b>immunities</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> for chastisement, they have not explored the historical civil remedies available to wives for male addiction to alcohol...|$|R

5|$|The {{ban on the}} NSDAP {{was lifted}} in early 1928, {{in time for the}} Reichstag elections, held on 20 May. Results were poor, with the NSDAP losing nearly 100,000 voters and earning only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they {{attained}} only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of twelve NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag. This gave him <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in Der Angriff {{over the course of the}} previous year.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution</b> if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>prosecution.</b> A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the events}} of the Ponce massacre, a Grand Jury convened to {{investigate}} the Ponce events, but it was closed before it could indict anyone. The prosecutor investigating the case reported at a news conference that Governor Winship was interfering with his investigation and resigned under protest.
