5|$|No British {{aircraft}} were encountered {{and much}} <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> {{in the area}} south of the fortress. The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged. In {{the northern part of}} Gibraltar, fires broke out.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the People's Republic of China in 1949, some <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up in revolutionary zeal. During the Cultural Revolution, however, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Satisfaction {{to be made}} to {{the owner}} (and that first, too, before the <b>damage</b> <b>be</b> <b>done)</b> <b>is</b> an {{unquestionable}} equivalent; and both together, I think, are a very full answer to any objection in that case.|$|R
50|$|A cryoprotective {{compound}} (a liquid called cryopreservation medium), {{along with}} carefully controlled cooling and warming cycles ensure that minimal <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to the cells.|$|R
50|$|Each {{unit type}} has three {{statistics}} for attacking: effectiveness against infantry (EI), effectiveness against vehicles (EV), and effectiveness against air units (EA). If the attacker's effectiveness stat against the unit type of the defender {{is higher than}} the defender's armor rating, <b>damage</b> will <b>be</b> <b>done</b> according to Attacker Effectiveness # - Defender Armor #. If not, no damage or extremely low <b>damage</b> will <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Some units <b>are</b> specialized to only be able to attack a single type of unit. If enough <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to a unit, it will be destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Onlookers had {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} procession, and the soldiers were attacked on Eutaw Street by crowds throwing bricks and stones. No serious <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> and they continued until again, on Eutaw near Camden Street, they were stopped by the crowd, who injured several with their missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off. Most of the <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed}} and 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only slight <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E
5|$|Most {{units of}} Luftflotte 2 {{received}} {{the order to}} abandon morning operations, but some began their attacks aimed at airfields and ports in southern Britain.kg 76 abandoned its attack on Debden but struck at RAF Kenley and other airfields in Kent and Essex. Losses and results are unknown. KG 27 also abandoned most of its operations. III./KG 27 did attempt {{to make it through}} to the Bristol docks, losing one He 111 to No. 87 Squadron RAF in the attempt. Little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1788, 13 July, a hailstorm sweeps across France and the Dutch Republic with hailstones 'as big as quart bottles' {{that take}} 'three days to melt'; immense <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If enough <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to an arm, {{it will be}} severed {{from the}} character's body, {{rendering}} it useless in combat. A character can lose both arms in the same round, forcing them to fight with only legs and head and depriving them {{of the ability to}} block. <b>Damage</b> can also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to the legs, but they cannot be severed.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, Hurricane Agnes {{severely}} damaged the spillway. The lake was lowered and repairs were made. When another storm hit in October 1972, more <b>damages</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> but the reinforced spillway saved the lake.|$|R
5|$|October 3, 1979: The Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado, an {{extremely}} destructive F4 tornado, {{one of the}} worst in Connecticut history, killed three and injured 500 in northern Hartford County. The tornado struck without warning, tearing through Bradley International Airport, destroying more than a dozen airplanes, and narrowly missing a Boeing 727 which was attempting to land. About 100 homes were completely leveled. Most of the $200+ million in <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in Windsor Locks and Suffield. This was the sixth-most damaging tornado in US history.|$|E
5|$|Over these centuries, {{the city}} {{suffered}} numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa. Not all damage {{was due to}} invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, {{a great deal of}} <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Yarmouth, {{which took}} place in , was an attack by the German Navy on the British North Sea port and town of Great Yarmouth. Little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to the town itself, since shells only landed on the beach once German ships laying mines {{offshore}} were interrupted by British destroyers. One British submarine was sunk by a mine as it attempted to leave harbour and attack the German ships, while one German armoured cruiser was sunk after striking two mines outside its own home port.|$|E
50|$|Though no {{distinct}} immune factor {{has been}} isolated {{as a cause}} of arthritis, some experts believe that the triggering factor may be something like a virus which then disappears from the body after permanent <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
5000|$|They must be {{reversible}} (that is, when {{a properly}} prepared piano has been [...] "unprepared", {{it should be}} impossible for anyone to tell that it had ever been prepared; no permanent <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to the piano).|$|R

5|$|The {{greatest}} <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> on the lakes. Major shipwrecks {{occurred on}} all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters {{also stated that}} the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistake was}} easy to make, Le Culot was located nearby. Sint-Truiden housed the 48th Fighter Group and 404th Fighter Group. The 492nd Fighter Squadron was readying to take off at 09:20. JG 4 hit the {{airfield}} at 09:15. Several P-47s taxiing out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction. The small-scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> at Le Culot airfield.|$|E
5|$|XX Bomber Command {{conducted}} {{its first}} combat operation on 5June 1944. On this day 98 B-29s were dispatched from bases in India to attack targets in Bangkok, Thailand, as a 'dress rehearsal' for more ambitious operations against Japan and targets in South East Asia. Although little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> and five B-29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults, {{the operation was}} rated a success by XX Bomber Command as it provided useful combat experience for the bomber crews as well as data on how the B-29 performed in action.|$|E
50|$|In November 1972, {{he participated}} in AIM's {{occupation}} of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) headquarters in Washington, D.C. to protest abuses. Many records were taken or destroyed, and more than $2 million in <b>damages</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to the building.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{fighting}} {{is the most}} common form of combat in Icar. A player rolls a percentile to hit the target and <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> depending on the weapon's penetration, the target's armour and rounds fired. Modifiers are used to account for the situation.|$|R
50|$|Prosecretin is a {{precursor}} to secretin, which is present in digestion. Secretin is stored in this unusable form, and is activated by gastric acid in the lower intestine to neutralize the pH and ensure no <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to the small intestine by the aforementioned acid.|$|R
5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> it is considered a British victory.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, a {{force of}} 80 Do 17s of KG 3—escorted by JG 51, JG 52, JG 54 and 60 Bf 109s from JG 26 (some 270 {{aircraft}} in all)—headed for Eastchurch airfield and the Short Brothers factory at Rochester. III./KG 3 {{broke away from the}} main formation and attacked Eastchurch while II./KG 3 headed for Rochester. Significant <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to the factory producing the Short Stirling heavy bomber. The RAF's No. 3, No. 64, No. 111, No. 151, No. 234, No. 249, No. 601 and No. 609 Squadrons intercepted. According to the account of JG 26, the British fighters made little impression on the bombers. Three JG 51 Bf 109s were shot down in skirmishes with RAF fighters.|$|E
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
40|$|A serious {{earthquake}} eccurred in the north-eastern part of Tottori prefecture. The {{loss of life}} ammounted to 1117, severely wounded 669, totally destroyed houses 7485 {{and burned}} houses 251 (statistics for Sept. 17, 1943) The <b>damages</b> <b>were</b> related to the river basin; about 80 % of these <b>damages</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> in the basin of Hukuro-gawa(river) {{in the city of}} Tottori...|$|R
50|$|CSL {{coverage}} combines {{public liability}} and passenger liability coverage {{into a single}} coverage with a single overall limit per accident. This type of coverage provides more flexibility in paying claims for liability, especially if passengers are injured, but little <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to third party property on the ground.|$|R
50|$|Aware {{about the}} threat, Gibbs checks the armory while Todd protects the President. The armory is open, and a {{journalist}} {{is trying to}} get to the President's quarters in an attempt to kill him. Gibbs confronts the journalist, who attacks, but is killed before any <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 4 January 1913, the Ottoman Navy and Army {{attempted}} a landing at Bozca Ada (Tenedos) to retake the island from the Greeks. Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest}} of the fleet supported the operation, but the appearance of the Greek fleet forced the Ottomans to break off the operation. The Greeks also withdrew, and several Ottoman cruisers opened fire as both sides departed, but no <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> By 15:30, Barbaros Hayreddin was back at Çanakkale inside the safety of the Dardanelles. On 10 January, the fleet conducted a patrol outside the Dardanelles. They encountered several Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw, but inflicted no damage on the Greek ships.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> to {{the church}} in 1400 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr; his forces also destroyed the Bishop's Palace at Llandaff. The damage was extensive enough to cause Bishop Blethyn to notify his fellow clergymen in 1575 that he believed the cathedral to possibly be damaged beyond repair. Most of the other damage was repaired, most notably by Bishop Marshall, whose reredos partly survives. The northwest tower, the one without a spire, was added by Jasper Tudor and is now named after him. He assumed the lordship of Cardiff after the accession to the throne of his nephew, King Henry VII of England.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{returned}} to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the second engineer of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun HMS Norwich {{and began the}} bombardment on 16 November. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An {{attempt was made to}} bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> and Benbow's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer. There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective.|$|E
50|$|If, as analysed, an ABC is a {{determination}} of civil obligations, <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to children's understanding of, and to, the Rule of Law as the basics of a fair and just society if the pre-requisites of the Rule of Law are flouted in obtaining a signed ABC.|$|R
50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of {{nephritic syndrome}} {{is dependent on}} where <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by antibody-antigen complexes (in the glomerulus). In the case of IgA nephropathy, the glomerulus cannot filter IgA antibody-antigen, and this causes an inflammatory response, then release of cytokines (and growth factors), and finally results in glomerular scarring.|$|R
25|$|Because the mother's body is able {{to break}} down {{phenylalanine}} during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no <b>damage</b> has yet <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> However, a blood test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after {{one or two days}} of normal infant feeding. This is the purpose of newborn screening, to detect the disease with a blood test before any <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> so that treatment can prevent the damage from happening.|$|R
