5|$|Richard Romanus as Vinnie Genzianna, {{leader of}} the Stompers. A cool, stylish young man. Though <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> has his problems, he does seem to care about those he is close to and at least tries {{to be strong and}} respectful.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, and by the time <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

5000|$|Asked how {{are people}} {{reacting}} to the storyline Brian Capron {{said in an interview}} with Digital Spy: [...] "It’s great, it really seems to be capturing people’s imaginations. Everyone just wants to know what he’s going to do next and if he’ll kill Gail. I don’t know what the writers have got planned for Richard but <b>he’s</b> <b>definitely</b> not finished yet I can promise that. I think he’ll be homing in on one or two of the street’s best-loved residents. <b>He’s</b> <b>definitely</b> going to get nastier before he gets his comeuppance".|$|R
25|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> did {{not perform}} the world's first radio broadcast, an honor that belongs to Enrico Marconi, Susini is often credited, {{especially}} in Argentine publications, {{with the establishment of}} the world's first regular radio broadcast service.|$|E
25|$|Darlington's account {{goes further}} than other commentators. He seems to credit Lawrence with a modern {{appreciation}} of selection (which <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> did not have); subsequently, Darlington's account was criticised as an over-statement. Darlington does not claim Lawrence actually enunciated {{a theory of}} evolution, though passages in Lawrence's book do suggest that races were historically developed. On heredity and adaptation, and the rejection of Lamarckism (soft inheritance), Lawrence is quite advanced.|$|E
25|$|Holloway was {{relieved}} as CINCNELM by Admiral Robert L. Dennison in March 1959. Returning to Washington for his well-attended retirement ceremony a month later, Holloway declared that <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> would {{not follow the}} example of other high-ranking military retirees in that he was actually going to retire, not start a second career in business. After his retirement from the Navy, he served as Governor of the United States Naval Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1964 until 1966.|$|E

Their son Tom was born in July 2015.|$|R
25|$|Abueva was {{not able}} to suit up in Alaska's first three {{assignments}} as he still needed to finish his duties with his school in the NCAA. In his highly anticipated debut game, Abueva made an immediate impact as he came through with a beastly performance against the Petron Blaze Boosters. Still smarting from his alma mater's NCAA final four loss to Letran 4 days before, he showed that <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> is ready for the big leagues, finishing with 12 points and 16 rebounds in just 27 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1500s, Paracelsus was {{probably}} the first to criticize Galen publicly. Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, {{but he was not}} afraid of thinking for himself and <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern medicine, overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles.|$|E
25|$|On 13 April {{while on}} his march from Villefranche to Castelnaudary the Marshal {{was caught up}} by the {{officers}} from Paris. They were met with a rebuff - Soult declared himself not convinced of the authenticity of their credentials. <b>He</b> <b>definitely</b> refused to acknowledge the provisional regime till he should have, what he considered, solid evidence of its legality. On receiving Soult's refusal to acknowledge the Provisional Government, Wellington sent him on 14 April a reply {{to the effect that}} no armistice would be granted until he made his submission; it was suspected that the Marshal wished to keep his army under his own hand for the purpose of Napoleonic intrigues. By 15 April Marshal Suchet at Perpignan had accepted the evidence, placed himself at the disposition of the new government and asked Wellington for an armistice.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{baseball}} researcher Frederick Ivor-Campbell {{said that}} Davis was [...] "the most neglected {{player of the}} 19th century. <b>He's</b> <b>definitely</b> the best eligible player not in the Hall, and he's {{a lot better than}} a lot of guys already in." [...] Around the same time, Davis was rated the 21st best baseball player of all time in the official baseball encyclopedia, Total Baseball.|$|R
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> appreciated it.|$|E
500|$|Drake {{appears on}} Pink Moon {{accompanied}} {{only by his}} own carefully recorded guitar save for a single piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: [...] "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. <b>He</b> <b>definitely</b> {{wanted it to be}} him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, Pink Moon is probably more like Nick is than the other two records." ...|$|E
500|$|Anatole Taubman as Elvis, Greene's second-in-command. Taubman {{wanted to}} make Elvis [...] "as colourful, as edgy and as {{interesting}} as possible", {{with one of his}} suggestions being the bowl cut. Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis [...] "a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really.... He's not a comic guy. <b>He</b> <b>definitely</b> takes himself very serious, but maybe by his taking himself too serious he may become friendly." ...|$|E

You always want an underdog guy, somebody to step up when presented with an opportunity." [...] Hector Otero, the Twins scout who signed Valencia and who was the general manager of the Mayagüez club, said: [...] "I think he is a talented player. <b>He</b> <b>definitely</b> can throw. He worked on his defense–worked extra before games–and everyone knows he can swing the bat." ...|$|E
500|$|Bhatti {{was already}} known to EastEnders {{executive}} producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street {{at the same}} time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm {{having a great time}} at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, {{for a very long time}} and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} released {{a few years}} later, Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win, but was critical of Arsenal's [...] "bitter" [...] reaction: [...] "Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand-balls. Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game I look back on more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football." ...|$|E

500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that I was feeling it when I wrote it. <b>He</b> <b>definitely</b> got the nuance of the song, and understood what {{it was supposed to}} mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Maximian {{retired to}} villas in Campania or Lucania. Their homes were distant from {{political}} life, but Diocletian and Maximian were {{close enough to}} remain in regular contact with each other. Galerius assumed the consular fasces in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at Carnuntum (Petronell-Carnuntum, Austria). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint Licinius to be augustus in place of Severus, who had died {{at the hands of}} Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation. Diocletian's reply: [...] "If you could show the cabbage that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, <b>he</b> <b>definitely</b> wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977."
