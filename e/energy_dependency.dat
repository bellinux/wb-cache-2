40|$|The signal {{intensity}} in low-energy ion scattering depends, among others, on the kinetic {{energy of the}} scattered ions. The measured energy dependence {{is a combination of}} the intrinsic energy dependence, determined by the ion- sample interaction, and the energy dependence of the instrumental response function. The intrinsic energy dependence is often exploited to obtain information on the charge transfer processes taking place between the ions and the sample surface. The resulting information is of relevance both for quantitative surface analysis as well as for obtaining a fundamental understanding of charge transfer processes. For a correct determination of the intrinsic energy dependence it is crucial that the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> of the analyser transmission and the ion detection efficiency of the instrument are accurately known. In this paper we outline how these <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> may be obtained, and we present the results for the cylindrical mirror analyser and microchannelplate-based detector in our apparatus. The discussions about the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> are not specific for our apparatus, but can be applied directly to other cylindrical mirror analysers and channelplate-based detectors. Therefore, the similarities and differences with other types of analysers are briefly discussed. The implications of uncertainties in these <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> for charge-exchange studies and quantitative compositional surface analysis are treated in detail...|$|R

30|$|In short, {{we propose}} a simple {{numerical}} procedure for calculating the energies and wave functions of a singly ionized molecular complex formed by two separated on-axis donors located at vertically coupled QDs {{in the presence}} of the external magnetic field. Our calculation includes some important characteristics of the heterostructure such as the presence of the wetting layer and the possibility of the variation of the QD morphology. The curves of the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> on the external magnetic field for the disk-like, lens-like, and cone-like structures are presented. We find that the effect of the in-plane confinement on the electron-ion separation is stronger in spike-shaped QDs and therefore the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> in such structures exhibit a behavior similar to that in ring-like structures. The analysis of the curves of the density of electronic states also confirms this result.|$|R

The curves of the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> on the external magnetic field and the separation between quantum dots are presented. Analyzing the curves of the low-lying energies as functions of the magnetic field applied along the symmetry axis, we find that the two-electron configuration evolves from one similar to a rigid rotator to gas-like as the dot radii decrease. This quantum size effect is accompanied by a significant modification of the density of the energy states and the <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> on the external magnetic field and geometric parameters of the structure.|$|R

40|$|We model <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> of the quasi {{periodic}} oscillations (QPO) in {{the model}} of disc epicyclic motions, with X-ray modulation caused by varying relativistic effects. The model was proposed to explain the high frequency QPO observed in X-ray binaries. We consider two specific scenarios for the geometry of accretion flow and spectral formation. Firstly, a standard cold accretion disc with an active X-ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate. Secondly, only a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is absent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectra are generally similar to the spectrum of radiation emitted at the QPO radius, and they are broadened by the relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. We also review the available data on <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> of high frequency QPO, and we point out that they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra. This would suggest the hot flow geometry in the spectral states when high frequency QPO are observed. Comment: 8 pages, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{carry out}} a systematical study of the {{spectral}} lag properties of 50 single-pulsed Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by Fermi/GBM. By dividing the light curves into multiple consecutive energy channels we provide a new measurement of the spectral lag which is independent on energy channel selections. We perform a detailed statistical study of our new measurements. We find two similar power-law <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> of both the pulse arrival time and pulse width. Our new results on the power-law indices would favor the relativistic geometric effects for the origin of spectral lag. However, a complete theoretical framework that can fully account for the diverse <b>energy</b> <b>dependencies</b> of both arrival time and pulse width revealed in this work is still missing. We also study the spectral evolution behaviors of the GRB pulses. We find that the GRB pulse with negligible spectral lag would usually have a shorter pulse duration and would {{appear to have a}} "hardness-intensity tracking" (HIT) behavior and the GRB pulse with a significant spectral lag would usually have a longer pulse duration and would appear to have a "hard-to-soft" (HTS) behavior.
