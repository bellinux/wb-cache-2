According to the practical condition of a domestic hot rolled strip plant, the unit strip crown change from the first stand to the last stand was calculated when the entry crown of hot strip varies.

The article {{presents}} the results of physical simulations of the process of rolling plates of steel in the strength category 350 ÷ 460 MPa on the <b>finishing</b> <b>stand</b> of a reversing mill. The simulations were performed for three steel grades and final plate thicknesses 40 mm. The purpose of the simulations was to select the conditions of plate deformation to obtain, directly after rolling, structure of material corresponding to the structure obtained from normalizing annealing. Thus, the simulations reflected the normalizing rolling process. The research carried out has allowed to elaborate the new technology of production of rolling plate without an additional thermal treatment like normalization.

40|$|Nowadays, it is {{possible}} to find experimental data about the longitudinal temperature distribution for a hot rolling strip production. However, it is much more difficult to obtain experimental results on the transverse temperature distribution on the strip surface. After a systematic analysis of the methods and results in the literature, the experimental data collected using a specific experimental apparatus to measure the transverse strip temperature distribution out of the last <b>finishing</b> <b>stand</b> of a 1800 mm wide thin hot strip rolling mill are presented. In order to logically classify all the results by identifying the main factors that influence the strip temperature profile, it is proposed to describe more clearly four new parameters of the strip thermal profiles which would allow the investigation of the reason for uneven transverse temperature distributions. The relationship between strip temperature distribution, strip geometry and temperature itself is also studied to provide a basis to build a mathematical model for the current problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA high {{chromium}} (HiCr) iron {{work roll}} broke in three pieces in <b>finishing</b> <b>stand</b> 4 in a compact strip production (CSP) mill of a steel company. This roll breakage was examined {{by means of}} visual inspection, analysis of the mill process data, and chemical and microscopic analysis of a sample from the spheroidal graphite (SG) iron roll core. The roll broke due to inferior quality of the roll core. Due to strong contamination with chromium (1. 5 %), far above the limit for the CSP mill (max. 0. 50 %Cr), the core microstructure contained abundant millimeter-sized (Cr,Fe) -carbide clusters, leading to a poor impact toughness. The quality criteria in the test report were adequate, and depending on the data the mill put the roll in service. Unfortunately, the supplied roll contained incorrect data {{with respect to the}} chromium level (0. 5 %Cr) {{and to a lesser extent}} the Mo levels in the roll core after solidification. If the test certificate had shown the actual core composition, would have been rejected and the roll failure would have been prevented. The paper describes the causes of the roll failure manufactured from high chrome grade steel along with the precautionary measure...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{demonstrate}} that, in laboratory conditions and using a physical simulator of metallurgical processes, it us possible to reflect the actual production process and, at the same time, to simulate new, not necessarily perfect rolling technologies, while not incurring any outlays on industrial lots of a new product line. Design/methodology/approach: The article present the results of physical simulations {{of the process of}} rolling plates of steel S 460 NL 1 on the <b>finishing</b> <b>stand</b> of a reversing mill. The simulations were performed for three final plate thicknesses, namely 8, 10 and 12 mm.

Thus, the simulations reflected the normalizing rolling process.

40|$|Purpose: The {{analysis}} of asymmetric band {{rolling in the}} <b>finishing</b> <b>stand</b> of a plate rolling mill {{has been carried out}} within the present study with the aim of establishing the effect of the speed asymmetry factor, av, on band bending during the rolling process and determining the strain velocity distributions of the rolled material in the roll bite region. Design/methodology/approach: The simulation of metal flow in the asymmetric roll bite region was performed using the program FORGE 2 D. The development of numerous branches of the steelmaking industry imposes increasingly high demands on steel product manufacturers, which can only be met by products manufactured according to the state-of-the-art plastic working technologies. One of the major plastic working technologies is asymmetric rolling. Findings: The analysis shows that the band bends most often toward the lower-speed roll. Increasing the value of the speed asymmetry factor causes an increase in the advance, while the force parameters decrease with increasing asymmetry factor av. Practical implications: Asymmetric rolling is achieved by differentiating working roll diameters, roll rotational speeds, or roll surface roughness. In industrial practice, one or a combination of the above-mentioned parameters is used. Originality/value: In order to improve the asymmetric plate rolling process, the {{analysis of}} the following parameters must be carried out: band temperature, the magnitude of rolling reduction, the magnitude of yield stress for particular steel grades, roll rotational speeds and roll diameters...|$|E

40|$|High Speed Steel (HSS) cast rolls {{are used}} in front <b>finishing</b> <b>stands</b> of hot strip mills (HSM). Good wear {{resistance}} and hardness at high temperatures, are defining features of HSS. Previous experience has shown that HSS rolls containing mainly hard MC carbides have a high friction coefficient, which is detrimental for the rolling power consumption and for the strip surface quality. On the other hand, HSS rolls containing eutectic rod shaped carbides are brittle and more susceptible to spalling. To overcome these problems, a suitable grade, called HSS 7, that gives the best compromise between a low friction coefficient and a high crack propagation and wear resistance was developed. That alloy contains well-dispersed hard VC carbides improving wear, and non-interconnected eutectic carbides of the M 2 C and M 7 C 3 type, hindering crack propagation. All the metallurgical factors affecting the performance and damage of under rolling condition in front <b>finishing</b> <b>stands</b> are reviewed: wear resistance, friction coefficient, resistance to rolling incident, and oxide film formation.
