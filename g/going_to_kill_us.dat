2500|$|Within {{one second}} of each other, President Kennedy, Governor Connally, and Mrs. Kennedy all turned {{abruptly}} from looking to their left to looking to their right, between Zapruder film frames 155 and 169. Connally, like the President, was a World War II military veteran but unlike him, a longtime hunter. Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then he turned his head and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not see the President, so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired. The doctor who operated on Connally measured his head {{at the time he was}} hit as turned 27 degrees left of center. After Connally was hit he shouted, [...] "Oh, no, no, no. My God. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said to Scowl, [...] "if {{they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us,</b> they would {{scarcely}} {{take the trouble}} to feed us first. So let us keep up our hearts and eat." ...|$|E
60|$|They were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> too, {{but one of}} them, the leader, named King, {{would not}} let them, and so they sailed south along the coast to a lonely spot where they found a good harbor, and here they landed and have left us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Estelle, {{with her}} quiet yet childlike resolution, 'they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> any of <b>us</b> yet. They said so. You are so tired, poor Victorine! Now all the hubbub is over, suppose you lie still and sleep. My uncle,' as he roamed round her, {{mourning}} for his rosary, 'I am afraid your beads are lost; but see here, these little round seeds, I can pierce {{them if you}} will gather some more for me, and make you another set. See, these will be the Aves, and here are shells in the grass for the Paters.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Corchado {{received}} {{a tip from}} a “trusted U.S. intelligence source” that the Zetas, a paramilitary group spun off from the Gulf Cartel, would be killing an American journalist within 24 hours. The tipster believed that Corchado was the target, and urged that he leave Mexico at once. Corchado phoned some “colleagues who were preparing a celebration dinner for me that evening” - {{he had just been}} awarded the Maria Moors Cabot Prize - and “said, there’s a death threat and I think we should cancel dinner. Dudley Althaus from the Houston Chronicle insisted, 'If they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> you, he said, they will have <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us,</b> too. So come on over and have some tequila.'” ...|$|R
5000|$|But Double Take adds a {{contemporary}} twist: [...] "You {{think all the}} way through that cinema is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> by television or television is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> cinema or America is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Russia or Russia is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> America. But at the end, it’s the third one, the new one, the younger one, the YouTube version, that comes along and kills them all." ...|$|R

I found it out, and I {{never said a}} word about it, because I was able to slip away when I liked; and no one knows {{anything}} about it. But it doesn't make much difference, now, because the Romans are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all. So I will tell you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a girl, monsieur; {{my name is}} Louise Pickard. We {{have been}} hiding in the forest for six weeks--my father and mother, my sister, and ten Frenchmen, who worked for us. We lived on fruit and what {{provisions}} the men could obtain by {{going down to the}} plantations at night. Two days ago the negroes found us; they killed one of the men at once, {{and the rest of us}} they took. My sister and I were dressed as boys. They were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> one by one; they burnt one of the men to death yesterday, and tied us to trees round and made us look on. This morning they killed another; they cut off his arms at the elbows and his legs at the knees, and then cut him about with knives till he died. Then they shut us up together again. There was a little window, and my father pushed me through it. He had heard the negroes say that there was a vessel in the bay with white men in it. The hole was in the back of the house, and there were trees there, so that I managed to get off without being seen by the negroes. My father tried to get Valerie through the same window, but she was too big. She is two years older than I am, and I could not have squeezed through had not my father pushed me. He told me to come down to the shore and take refuge with you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow" [...] Earth Day {{people come}} to South Park. The Earth Day people utilize a jedi mind trick to make the townspeople not only believe that all they say is correct, while that which conservatives say is slander, but to also build for them a massive Earth Day celebration. When Stan says [...] "My dad is a {{geologist}} and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming", they answer [...] "That's not true, global warming is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all.

5000|$|On October 23, {{shop owner}} Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs along a barren road in Northern California, chased by mysterious figures in {{business}} suits. He {{makes it to}} a gas station clutching a Silver Shamrock jack-o'-lantern mask. He is driven to the hospital by station attendant Walter Jones (Essex Smith), all the while rambling, [...] "they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all". At the hospital, Grimbridge {{is placed in the}} care of Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins). That night, another mysterious man in a suit enters Grimbridge's hospital room, kills him, then goes to his car and immolates himself.|$|E
5000|$|Governor Connally, {{riding in}} the middle jump seat of the President's {{limousine}} {{in front of the}} President, recalled hearing the first shot which he immediately recognized as a rifle shot. He said he immediately feared an assassination attempt and turned to his right to look back to see the President. He looked over his right shoulder but did not catch the President {{out of the corner of}} his eye so he said he began to turn back to look to his left when he felt a forceful impact to his back. He stated to the Warren Commission: [...] "I immediately, when I was hit, I said, “Oh, no, no, no.” And then I said, “My God, they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all.” He looked down and saw that his chest was covered with blood and thought he had been fatally shot. Then he heard the third and final shot, which sprayed blood and brain tissue over them.|$|E

5000|$|So I {{was home}} that night and I saw an {{infomercial}} {{or one of those}} things. This was back in the '80s before they really had a lot of them. It was for some '50s and '60s Greatest Dance Songs compilation, and it had [...] "The Twist", [...] "The Mashed Potato", [...] "The Watusi", everything you can think of, it had one of those songs. [...] "The Stroll." [...] Anything that had a song that had a dance to it, they did. And I thought, [...] "Wow, good idea." [...] So I wrote the lyrics as a parody and I wrote it as a joke. I didn't even think {{that we were going to}} use it. If you read the lyrics, they're kind of silly. I'm thinking, you know, here we are, this totally hard thrash band, we kick in your face and rape and murder your wife, and now here we're writing a parody of a '60s or '50s dance number. And then Gary read the lyrics and was, like, [...] "These are brilliant, dude." [...] I'm all, [...] "No way. If we put this on there, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us.</b> Are you kidding? They're going to be flipping us off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kitsune {{keep their}} {{promises}} and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a kitsune attaches {{itself to a}} person or household, where they can cause all sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner's threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch appears in the man's dreams: My father lived here before me, sir, and by now I have many children and grandchildren. They get {{into a lot of}} mischief, I'm afraid, and I'm always after them to stop, but they never listen. And now, sir, you're understandably fed up with us. I gather that you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all. But I just want you to know, sir, how sorry I am that this is our last night of life. Won't you pardon us, one more time? If we ever make trouble again, then of course you must act as you think best. But the young ones, sir — I'm sure they'll understand when I explain to them why you're so upset. We'll {{do everything we can to}} protect you from now on, if only you'll forgive us, and we'll be sure to let you know when anything good is going to happen!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The bombing caused bedlam in {{the crowded}} street. Hundreds of people rushed to the scene where they formed human chains to help the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) free those trapped beneath the rubble by digging with their bare hands. Peter Taylor {{described}} the scene as [...] "reminiscent of the London Blitz" [...] in World War II. One witness was Billy McQuiston, who had been walking down the Shankill with a friend {{when they heard the}} blast. Rushing to the scene, McQuiston later recounted what he saw and felt upon reaching the wrecked building:"Women were crying. Men were trying to dig out the rubble. Other men were hitting the walls. One person was crying beside you and the next person was shouting 'Bastards' and things like that. I didn't actually see the babies' bodies as they had them wrapped in sheets, but the blood was just coming right through them. They were just like lumps of meat, you know, small lumps of meat. All these emotions were going through you and you wanted to help. There were people shouting at the back, 'Let's get something done about this'. To be perfectly honest with you, I just stood there and cried, just totally and utterly numb. It wasn't until I got back home that I realised, this isn't a game. There's a war going on here. These people are trying to do us all in. They're trying to kill us all and they don't care who we are or what age we are. Because we're Protestants, they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> so we're {{going to have to do}} something here".|$|E

5000|$|Jack {{makes it}} back to his family's room, but learns that Lucy is {{swimming}} in the pool downstairs. Jack barely gets to Lucy in time before rebels pour onto the pool area. Meanwhile, a horrified Annie sees the rebels going from room to room, killing the occupants. She barely manages {{to keep them out}} of their room. As Jack returns with Lucy, he encounters a rebel in the stairwell, but Hammond saves him and tells him to get to the roof. Jack's family go up there and join some of the hotel's guests and staff, who have gathered and blocked the door. On the roof, other hotel tourists warn Jack away from leaning over the edge of the roof, as the rebels below will take a shot at whoever they can see. Jack looks over the roof anyway and sees that hundreds of rebels are gathering at the base of the hotel, and that they have seized most of the city. A French hotel occupant interprets what they are chanting ("Don't resist. There will be no prisoners, because they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> anyway.", [...] "Blood for water!") Upon questioning an injured hotel worker, they learn that the rebels are protesting the Western corporations' control of the water supply. An approaching helicopter is then heard. Everyone's relief turns to horror as they realize it belongs to the rebels, who open fire on the innocents below. As Jack's family run for cover, the helicopter gets tangled in some electrical wires and crashes. The rebels break through the blocked door and begin to shoot the survivors as Jack and his family jump onto the roof of an office building next to the hotel. He looks back and sees the rebels holding up the [...] "Welcome" [...] banner from Cardiff with his photo on it, realizing he is a high-value target.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This paper {{defends the}} moral {{significance}} {{of the distinction between}} killing and letting die. In {{the first part of the}} paper, I consider and reject Michael Tooley’s argument that initiating a causal process is morally equivalent to refraining from interfering in that process. The second part disputes Tooley’s suggestion it is merely external factors that make killing appear to be worse than letting die, when in reality the distinction is morally neutral. Tooley is mistaken to claim that we are permitted to kill bystanders who had no fair chance to avoid being at risk of harm. We can support the {{significance of the}} killing / letting die distinction by considering the difference between what we are permitted to do in self-defence against those who are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>us,</b> and what we can do against those who are going to let us die. I also suggest that we are less responsible for the deaths we allow than for the deaths that we cause, since we do not make people worse off for our presence in cases where we fail to save them...|$|E
