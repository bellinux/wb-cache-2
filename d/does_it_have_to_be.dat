500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Ravi's defense {{attorney}} requested a mistrial because {{the prosecution had}} not presented evidence {{to the grand jury}} which, he argued, would have cleared Ravi, and had presented other evidence in what he said was a misleading manner. This evidence included documents that showed that Clementi had titled files on his computer [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so painful" [...] and took photographs of the George Washington Bridge a month before entering Rutgers. The judge did not grant Ravi's motion. Ravi was not charged with a role in the suicide.|$|E
2500|$|When Mario first {{utilized}} Edgar Sampson {{to write}} the very first drafts of arrangements for the Machito and his Afro-Cubans, he would draw three sticks for Sampson underneath the bar with the three-side and two sticks underneath the bar with the two-side. This way he would always know rhythmically where {{he was in the}} chart and supervise Sampson who was unaware of the clave concept in Cuban music. Mario utilized Sampson’s harmonic mastery and Mario utilized his rhythmic mastery. Sampson asked Mario [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this way?"

50|$|Ultimately the {{creative}} process has not been faithful to the truth but <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> More than most writers, Beckett plumbed {{the depths of his}} own life for source material. Some sections are transparently biographical (e.g. the scene in Krapp’s Last Tape where Krapp’s mother dies) but exactly how faithful to the truth only Beckett himself would know. But it is a work of fiction, not a psychological treatise and certainly not biography in the strictest sense; the facts are bent to fit the truth of the play.|$|E
