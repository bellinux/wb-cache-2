50|$|One type of FCAW {{requires}} no shielding gas. This {{is made possible}} by the <b>flux</b> <b>core</b> in the tubular consumable electrode. However, this core contains more than just flux, it also contains various ingredients that when exposed to the high temperatures of welding generate a shielding gas for protecting the arc. This type of FCAW is attractive because it is portable and generally has good penetration into the base metal. Also, windy conditions need not be considered. Some disadvantages are that this process can produce excessive, noxious smoke (making it difficult to see the weld pool); As with all welding processes, the proper electrode must be chosen to obtain the required mechanical properties. Operator skill is a major factor as improper electrode manipulation or machine setup can cause porosity.|$|E
50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including flux paste, liquid, powder or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a <b>flux</b> <b>core.</b> In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the methodology of}} the de-soldering process for rework of disk drive Head Stack Assembly (HSA) units. The auto wire feeder is a machine that generates Tin (Sn) on the product. This machine {{was determined to be}} one of the major sources of excess Sn on the HSA. The defect rate due to excess Sn is more than 30 %, which leads to increased processing time and cost to perform additional cleaning steps. From process analysis, the major causes of excess Sn are as follows: 1) The machine cannot cut the wire all the way into the <b>flux</b> <b>core</b> area; 2) The sizes and types of soldering irons are not appropriate for the unit parts; and, 3) There are variations introduced into the de-soldering process by the workforce.
