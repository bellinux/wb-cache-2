The present study provides a new method to assess global vegetation <b>greening</b> <b>phase</b> dynamics, derived from fAPAR time series from four different remote sensing products. A robust algorithm is developed to detect intra-annual <b>greening</b> <b>phase</b> patterns and derive seasonality patterns of vegetation dynamics at the global scale. The comparison of four independent remote sensing datasets shows significantly consistent global spatiotemporal patterns at the 95 % confidence level. Regions where the remote sensing datasets show consistent results, as well as regions where {{at least one of}} the used remote sensing datasets deviates, can be identified. The derived global <b>greening</b> <b>phase</b> dataset and analysis method provides a solid framework for the evaluation of global vegetation models...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{pedestrian}} delay model suitable for signalized intersections in developing cities, {{on the basis}} of a field study conducted in Xi'an, China. The field study consisted of two parts: Part I involved only one crosswalk, and the signal cycle was divided into 13 subphases; Part II involved 13 crosswalks, but the signal cycles were only divided into <b>green</b> <b>phases</b> and non-green phases. It was found that pedestrian arrival rates were not uniform throughout cycles; pedestrians arriving during <b>green</b> <b>phases</b> might also receive delays; pedestrian signal non-compliance was so severe that delays were greatly reduced, but non-complying pedestrians might still receive delays; and for pedestrians walking different directions, though the relationships between average delay and arrival subphase were different, the overall average delays were almost the same. On the basis of the field study results, some assumptions are made about the relationship between average pedestrian delay and arrival subphase, and a new model is developed to estimate pedestrian delays at signalized intersections. The model is validated using the field data, and the validation results indicate that in Xi'an the new model provides much more accurate estimation than the existing models. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{parts of}} Canada (the Maritime Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta), a {{flashing}} circular green light indicates right-of-way to proceed in any direction; all other entrances to the intersection will face red lights, and all pedestrian signals will indicate do-not-cross. The flashing-green phase usually precedes a normal <b>green</b> <b>phase,</b> {{in which case}} it is known as an advanced green, and an [...] sign will often be mounted next to the signal, possibly with a corresponding [...] (or similar) sign facing oncoming traffic. When a flashing-green phase occurs after a normal <b>green</b> <b>phase,</b> it as known as an extended green, but this sequence is much less common, as it can create a hazardous yellow trap for oncoming left turns.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{clearance}} {{lost time}} {{is often not}} observable since observation requires that some vehicles which were waiting {{at the start of}} a <b>green</b> <b>phase</b> still be waiting when the <b>green</b> <b>phase</b> ends, it is typically determined through the equation , where [...] is the clearance lost time, [...] is the yellow time, [...] is the all-red interval time during which the traffic signal is red for all directions, and [...] is the portion of the yellow and all-red times during which vehicles are illegally in the intersection and has a default value of 2.0 seconds in HCM.

The contribution from upstream, downstream and further downstream links and platoon dispersion are taken into account.

When cotyledons were excised with a full hook and were partially or totally shielded from light with aluminum foil, the samples with the hook covered accumulated more chlorophyll than the wholly exposed samples.

40|$|A phase-based {{method for}} fixed-time signal control of traffic {{improves}} significantly the junction performance over conventional stage-based {{method of control}} due to the higher flexibility in specification of signal timings, where the control variables comprise the start and duration of <b>green</b> <b>phases</b> and the cycle time at which the junction is operated. The cycle-structure is specified by a successor function, a combination of 0 and 1 for all incompatible pairs of phases, which indicates the order of phases in a cycle. Normal procedure optimises the timings {{for each of these}} successor functions to determine the best timing plan. The computing time is found to be approximately proportional the number of such functions. To reduce the computational requirement, and hence enhance its applicability to real-time actuated control, a neural network is employed in this paper to help identify the optimal successor function for further optimisation of timings. Encouraging results are obtained. 1...|$|R
50|$|Prohibiting turns {{for traffic}} across the bus lane {{significantly}} reduces delays to the buses.

50|$|It turned out, missing speed {{recommendations}} cause burring a {{bunch of}} vehicles releases from the <b>green</b> <b>phase</b> of the traffic light behind. This also occurs when oncoming signals are placed in longer distances, burring {{a bunch of}} vehicles. Speed signs can recommend delaying or speeding up head and tail of the bunch, or recombining them in a theoretical set speed to reach and completely pass the next signal on green without any stop and schedule it into to green wave.|$|E
50|$|Generally, a {{dedicated}} left-turn signal is illuminated {{at the beginning}} of the <b>green</b> <b>phase</b> of the green-yellow-red-green cycle. This is called a leading turn. This allows left-turn traffic, which often consists of just a few cars, to vacate the intersection quickly before giving priority to vehicles traveling straight. This increases the throughput of left-turn traffic while reducing the number of drivers, perhaps frustrated by long waits in heavy traffic for opposing traffic to clear, attempting to make an illegal left turn on red. A dedicated left-turn signal that appears at the end of the <b>green</b> <b>phase</b> is called a lagging turn. If there is no left-turn signal, the law requires one to yield to oncoming traffic and turn when the intersection is clear and it is safe to do so. In the U.S., many older inner-city and rural areas do not have dedicated left-turn lights, while most newer suburban areas have them. Such lights tend to decrease the overall efficiency of the intersection as it becomes congested, although it makes intersections safer by reducing the risk of head-on collisions and may even speed up through traffic, but if a significant amount of traffic is turning, {{a dedicated}} turn signal helps eliminate congestion.|$|E

40|$|Preemption {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} provide preferential treatment for buses at signalized intersections. A preemption strategy, if properly designed, can provide continuous <b>green</b> <b>phases</b> for buses at successive intersections, thereby reducing travel times and delays along the bus route. However, the length of delay incurred by all the vehicles in the sys-tem may {{be affected by the}} different bus headways under preemption operation. Unfortunately, no formal technique is available to assess the cumulative delay consequences of bus headways. The application of a simulation model, NETSIM, to test the effect of different headways is presented. NETSIM was selected because it can microscopically simu-late vehicular movements on a street network and because an animation feature within NETSIM is available that allows the user to track an indi-vidual vehicle from the source to the sink. A major bus route in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was used as the experiment site. The major conclusions are that NETSIM can generate delay data at various levels of aggrega...|$|R
