60|$|When he {{had first}} seen Mrs. Quest that {{afternoon}} she and Cossey were alone together, and he had noticed something unusual about her, something unnatural and intense. Indeed, he remembered {{he had told her}} that she looked like the Tragic Muse. Could it be that the look was the look of a woman maddened by insult and jealousy, who was meditating some fearful crime? /How did that gun go off?/ He did not see it, and he thanked heaven that he did not, for we are not always so anxious to bring our fellow creatures to justice as we might be, especially when they happen to be young and lovely women. How did it go off? She understood guns; he could see that from the way she handled it. Was it likely that it exploded of itself, or owing to an accidental touch of the trigger? It was possible, but not likely. Still, such things have been known to happen, and {{it would be very difficult}} to prove that it had not <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case.</b> If it should be attempted murder it was very cleverly managed, because nobody could prove that it was not accidental. But could it be that this soft, beautiful, baby-faced woman had on the spur of the moment taken advantage of his loaded gun to wreak her jealousy and her wrongs upon her faithless lover? Well, the face is no mirror of the quality of the soul within, and it was possible. Further than that it did not seem to him to be his business to inquire.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} witnessing long ago, in {{a country}} barn, a highly moral play. It was a Problem Play, now I {{come to think of}} it. At least, that is, {{it would have been a}} Problem Play but that the party with the past <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> to be merely a male thing. Stage life presents no problems to the man. The hero of the Problem Play has not got to wonder what to do; he has got to wonder only what the heroine will do next. The hero--he was not exactly the hero; he would have been the hero had he not been hanged in the last act. But for that he was rather a nice young man, full of sentiment and not ashamed of it. From the scaffold he pleaded for leave to embrace his mother just once more before he died. It was a pretty idea. The hangman himself was touched. The necessary leave was granted him. He descended the steps and flung his arms round the sobbing old lady, and--bit off her nose. After that he told her why he had bitten off her nose. It appeared that when he was a boy, he had returned home one evening with a rabbit in his pocket. Instead of putting him across her knee, and working into him the eighth commandment, she had said nothing; but that it seemed to be a fairly useful sort of rabbit, and had sent him out into the garden to pick onions. If she had done her duty by him then, he would not have been now in his present most unsatisfactory position, and she would still have had her nose. The fathers and mothers in the audience applauded, but the children, scenting addition to precedent, looked glum.|$|E
60|$|He {{took many}} volumes off the shelves, {{and put a}} few of them back again; and there he ended. Miss Milroy {{contrived}} in some mysterious manner to get, in this case, between the reader and the books. Her formal bow and her merciless parting speech dwelt, try how he might to forget them, on Allan's mind; he began to grow more and more anxious as the idle hour wore on, to recover his lost place in her favor. To call again that day at the cottage, and ask if he had been so unfortunate as to offend her, was impossible. To put the question in writing with the needful nicety of expression proved, on trying the experiment, to be a task beyond his literary reach. After a turn or two up and down the room, with his pen in his mouth, he decided on the more diplomatic course (which <b>happened,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> to be the easiest course, too), of writing to Miss Milroy as cordially as if nothing had happened, and of testing his position in her good graces by the answer that she sent him back. An invitation of some kind (including her father, of course, but addressed directly to herself) was plainly the right thing to oblige her to send a written reply; but here the difficulty occurred of what the invitation was to be. A ball was not to be thought of, in his present position with the resident gentry. A dinner-party, with no indispensable elderly lady on the premises to receive Miss Milroy--except Mrs. Gripper, who could only receive her in the kitchen--was equally out of the question. What was the invitation to be? Never backward, when he wanted help, in asking for it right and left in every available direction, Allan, feeling himself {{at the end of his}} own resources, coolly rang the bell, and astonished the servant who answered it by inquiring how the late family at Thorpe Ambrose used to amuse themselves, and what sort of invitations they were in the habit of sending to their friends.|$|E

In some approaches, the recommendation is immediately deduced from the preferences aggregation process.

The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on a set of test problems. Computational results show that the multiobjective genetic algorithm-based heuristic is capable of producing high-quality recommendations. ...|$|R

Humanoid robots have a {{large number}} of “extra ” joints, {{organized}} in a humanlike fashion with several kinematic chains. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> chapter we describe a method of motion planning that is based on an artificial potential field approach (Passive Motion Paradigm) combined with terminal-attractor dynamics.

Moreover, the remaining error at equilibrium is a valuable information for triggering a reasoning process and the search of an alternative plan.
