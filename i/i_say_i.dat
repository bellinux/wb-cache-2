In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> like to keep things interesting.

During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> <b>I</b> guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E

She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.

500|$|Colbert {{describes}} himself as racially color-blind and unable to visually identify a person's race, explaining, [...] "Now, I don't see race ... People tell me I'm white, and I believe them, because I own a lot of Jimmy Buffett albums." [...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I can spot a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something."

500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

Originally, Spitz was reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle, fearing a less-than-gold medal finish.

[...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It will probably be a popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly.

Herodotus writes, [...] "For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> myself noted before I heard it from others. When it occurred to me, I inquired of both peoples; and the Colchians remembered the Egyptians better than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians; [...] the Egyptians said that they considered the Colchians part of Sesostris' army. I myself guessed it, partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the Colchians and Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision."

With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. My companions and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe we expected to see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings pay my babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening.
