40|$|AbstractLinear multivariate {{problems}} {{are defined as}} the approximation of linear operators on functions of d variables. We study the complexity of computing an ϵ-approximation in different settings. We are particularly interested in large d and/or large ϵ− 1. Tractability means that the complexity is bounded by c(d) K(d, ϵ), where c(d) {{is the cost of}} one <b>information</b> <b>operation</b> and K(d, ϵ) is a polynomial in d and/or in ϵ− 1. Strong tractability means that K(d, ϵ) is a polynomial in ϵ− 1, independent of d. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for linear multivariate problems to be tractable or strongly tractable in the worst case, average case, randomized, and probabilistic settings. This is done for the class Λall where an <b>information</b> <b>operation</b> is defined as the computation of any continuous linear functional. We also consider the class Λstd where an <b>information</b> <b>operation</b> is defined as the computation of a function value. We show under mild assumptions that tractability in the class Λall is equivalent to tractability in the class Λstd. The proof is, however, not constructive. Finally, we consider linear multivariate problems over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, showing that such {{problems are}} strongly tractable even in the worst case setting...|$|R

In June 2011 the Canadian Armed Forces Chief of Force Development announced the establishment of a new organization, the Directorate of Cybernetics, headed by a Brigadier General, the Director General Cyber (DG Cyber). Within that directorate the newly established CAF Cyber Task Force, has been tasked to design and build cyber warfare capabilities for the Canadian Armed Forces.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists {{may also}} {{work on a}} diverse set of campaigns known broadly as {{psychological}} warfare. Psychologically warfare chiefly {{involves the use of}} propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source. The CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD. The U.S. military used the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), part of <b>Information</b> <b>Operations</b> (IO). Psychologists are sometimes involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, though this has sometimes been denied by those involved and sometimes opposed by others.|$|E
500|$|The 1st Special Operations Wing (1 SOW) {{is located}} at Hurlburt Field, Florida.

The wing's core missions include aerospace surface interface, agile combat support, combat aviation advisory operations, <b>information</b> <b>operations,</b> personnel recovery/recovery operations, precision aerospace fires, psychological operations dissemination, specialized aerospace mobility and specialized aerial refueling. Among its aircraft is the MC-130 Combat Talon II, a low-level terrain following special missions transport that can evade radar detection and slip into enemy territory at a [...] altitude for infiltration/exfiltration missions, even in zero visibility, dropping off or recovering men or supplies with pinpoint accuracy. It also operates the AC-130 Spooky and Spectre gunships that provide highly accurate airborne gunfire for close air support of conventional and special operations forces on the ground.|$|E

[...] "The funny thing about it was the government and administration was saying it's so embarrassing that they had to name it the 'Office of Strategic Influence,' we couldn't just put it in a room in the Pentagon and name it whatever the room number is," [...] Moore said.

In {{addition}} to Welch and Peyer, Lieutenant General Daniel Darnell, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, Space and <b>Information</b> <b>Operations,</b> and Major General Raaberg testified and answered questions from the Senate committee's members. During the hearing, Welch stated that [...] "the military units responsible for handling the bombs are not properly inspected and, as a result, may not be ready to perform their missions." [...] He added, [...] "If you look at all the areas and all the ways that we have to store and handle these weapons in order to perform the mission, it just requires, we believe, more resources and more attention than they're getting." [...] Welch's report concluded that the combining of DoD nuclear forces with nonnuclear organizations has led to [...] "markedly reduced levels of leadership whose daily focus is the nuclear enterprise and a general devaluation of the nuclear mission and those who perform the mission." [...] Nevertheless, neither Welch's nor Peyer's reports found any failures with the security of United States nuclear weapons.|$|E
