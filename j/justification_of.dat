5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution so that he could write a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826. Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Finding the <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> an {{entailment}} (that is, all {{the minimal}} set of axioms sufficient {{to produce an}} entailment) {{has emerged as a}} key inference service for the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Justifications are essential for debugging unsatisfiable classes and contradictions. The availability <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> as explanations <b>of</b> entailments improves the understandability of large and complex ontologies. In this paper, we present several algorithms for computing all the <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> an entailment in an OWL-DL Ontology and show, by an empirical evaluation, that even a reasoner independent approach works well on real ontologies...|$|R

We first propose a novel approach to find all <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> OWL pD*entailments using TMS and show the complexity of this approach.

25|$|For various reasons, an {{approach}} based on cardinal utility, where the utility has a meaning beyond just giving a ranking of alternatives, is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that approach, one can take intensities of preferences into consideration, or one can compare (i) {{gains and losses}} of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955) gives a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> utilitarianism (which evaluates alternatives {{in terms of the}} sum of individual utilities), originating from Jeremy Bentham. Hammond (1976) gives a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> the maximin principle (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the utility of the worst-off individual), originating from John Rawls.|$|E

40|$|A basic {{conviction}} in moral non-cognitivism is: only hypothetical norms may be justified. Hartmut Kliemt argues for a moderate variant: {{there are only}} hypothetical <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> norms whether the norms are hypothetical or categorical in kind.

It is argued that hypothetical <b>justifications</b> are not <b>of</b> the kind that we should look for in normative ethics...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this analysis}} are to: articulate clearly the central premises {{of each of the}} theories of punishment (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation) and, to explore the policy implications that flow from each <b>of</b> the <b>justifications.</b> The differences among the theoretical <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> punishment range from obvious to extremely subtle. This analysis clearly delineates the differing premises of the theories that underlie criminal justice. Attention then turns to the policies that would be pursued if any one <b>of</b> the <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> punishment were used as the primary basis of the criminal justice system. The major conclusion is that the poli cies derived from the competing theories lead in divergent and often contradictory directions. Finally, bureaucratic accommodations such as plea bargaining are explored in terms of their relationship to the theories of punishment. It is contended that plea bargaining and failure to prosecute multiple charges tend to run counter to all <b>of</b> the <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> the criminal sanction. The failure to address the policies of criminal justice with reference to the theories of punishment means that the system will have great difficulty achieving any particular goals...|$|R
