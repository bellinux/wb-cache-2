40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates an {{evolutionary}} multiobjective optimization algorithm, called EVOLT, which heuristically optimizes QoS (quality of service) parameters in communication networks. EVOLT uses {{a population of}} individuals, each of which represents a set of QoS parameters, and evolves the individuals via genetic operators such as crossover, mutation and selection for satisfying given QoS requirements. For <b>evaluating</b> EVOLT <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings</b> that have high-dimensional parameter and optimization objective spaces, this paper focuses on QoS optimization in safety-critical communication networks for electric power utilities. Simulation results show that EVOLT outperforms a well-known existing evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization and efficiently obtains quality QoS parameters with acceptable computational costs. Moreover, EVOLT visualizes obtained QoS parameters in a Self-Organizing Map in order to aid network administrators to intuitively understand the QoS parameters and the tradeoffs among optimization objectives...|$|R

The Semantic Web has proven invaluable in this effort; however, {{much of the literature}} is devoted to system design, ontology creation, and trials and tribulations of current technologies. In order to fully develop the nascent field of Semantic e-Science we must also <b>evaluate</b> systems <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings.</b> We describe a case study within the field of Heliophysics and provide a comparison of the evolutionary stages of data discovery, from manual to semantically enable. We describe the socio-technical implications of moving toward automated and intelligent data discovery. In doing so, we highlight how this process enhances what is currently being done manually in various scientific disciplines. Our case study illustrates that Semantic e-Science is more than just semantic search. The integration of search with web services, relational databases, and other cyberinfrastructure is a central tenet of our case study and one that we believe has applicability as a generalized research area within Semantic e-Science. This case study illustrates a specific example of the benefits, and limitations, of semantically replicating data discovery. We show examples of significant reductions in time and effort enable by Semantic e-Science; yet, we argue that a "complete" solution requires integrating semantic search with other research areas such as data provenance and web services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Although {{existing}} flooding protocols {{can provide}} efficient and reliable communication in {{wireless sensor networks}} on some level, further performance improvement has been hampered by the assumption of link independence, which requires costly acknowledgements (ACKs) from every receiver. In this paper, we present Collective Flooding (CF), which exploits the link correlation to achieve flooding reliability using the concept of collective ACKs. CF requires only 1 -hop information at each node, making the design highly distributed and scalable with low complexity. We <b>evaluate</b> CF extensively <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings,</b> using three different types of testbeds: a single hop network with 20 MICAz nodes, a multi-hop network with 37 nodes, and a linear outdoor network with 48 nodes along a 326 -meter-long bridge. System evaluation and extensive simulation show that CF achieves the same reliability as state-of-the-art solutions, while reducing {{the total number of}} packet transmission and the dissemination delay by 30 ∼ 50 % and 35 ∼ 50 %, respectively.

40|$|HCI is a {{field of}} study {{that is no longer}} {{confined}} to European or North American usability labs. HCI is practiced all over the world, and within Euro-American contexts, HCI research is also increasingly turning its attention to real world settings, outside of the controlled environments of the usability lab. One increasingly popular approach to designing and <b>evaluating</b> new technologies <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings</b> is called 'in the wild' research. We find this terminology uncomfortable from an African perspective as it evokes negative connotations of the contexts in which we study and the people we study with. Our intention is not to discredit this approach but rather to start a conversation around the terminologies we use to describe our research approaches and contexts. We consider it an ethical imperative to be conscious of the words we use to describe people and places, not only as HCI research expands its empirical focus to real world settings, but equally importantly to support HCI research beyond its traditional centres in Europe or Americ...|$|R
40|$|The {{circular}} sensing {{model has}} been widely used to estimate performance of sensing applications in existing analyses and simulations. While this model provides valuable high-level guidelines, the quantitative results obtained may not reflect the true performance of these applications, due to the sensing irregularity introduced by existence of obstacles in real deployment areas and insufficient hardware calibration. In this project, we design and implement two Sensing Area Modeling (SAM) techniques useful in the real world. They complement {{each other in the}} design space. Physical Sensing Area Modeling (P-SAM) provides accurate physical sensing area for individual nodes using controlled or monitored events, while Virtual Sensing Area Modeling (V-SAM) provides continuous sensing similarity between nodes using natural events in an environment. With these two models, we pioneer an investigation of the impact of sensing irregularity on application performance, such as coverage scheduling. We <b>evaluate</b> SAM extensively <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings,</b> using testbeds consisting of 14 XSM motes. To study the performance at scale, we also provide an extensive 1, 400 -node simulation. Evaluation results reveal several serious issues concerning circular models, and demonstrate significant improvements in several applications when SAM is used instead...|$|R

Methods: This was a hybrid US observational study consisting of a longitudinal cohort survey followed by linkage and analysis of respondents’ administrative claims data. Patients with NVAF receiving warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban completed an initial survey and follow-up surveys at 4, 8, and 12 months. Patient-reported adherence was measured at each survey by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS- 8) and pharmacy claims-determined adherence by the proportion of days covered (PDC) for the 12 -month period following the initial survey date; adherence was defined as MMAS- 8 score = 8 and PDC ≥ 80 %. Patient satisfaction with OAC therapy was assessed by the Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS). Results: Overall, 675 patients completed at least the initial survey (warfarin, n= 271; dabigatran, n= 266; rivaroxaban, n= 128; apixaban, n= 10). Fewer than half (47. 9 %) were PDC adherent, 37. 2 % were MMAS- 8 adherent, and 19. 4 % were adherent by both measures. Total medical costs of PDC-adherent patients were significantly lower vs PDC-nonadherent patients (US$ 640 vs $ 993 per-patient per-month, respectively, p< 0. 05). MMAS- 8 -adherent patients reported higher treatment satisfaction; total DASS score was significantly lower among MMAS- 8 -adherent than MMAS- 8 -nonadherent patients (37. 3 vs 42. 9, respectively, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Using claims-based or patient-reported methods to measure OAC adherence may lead to different results when assessing impact on health care costs and satisfaction with anticoagulation medication. These results underscore the importance of considering both claims-based and patient-reported measures when <b>evaluating</b> treatment adherence <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings.</b> Keywords: adherence, atrial fibrillation, OAC, health care cost...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{the future}} <b>in</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>settings,</b> {{particularly}} from raw sensory observations such as images, is exceptionally challenging. Real-world events can be stochastic and unpredictable, {{and the high}} dimensionality and complexity of natural images requires the predictive model to build an intricate understanding of the natural world. Many existing methods tackle this problem by making simplifying assumptions about the environment. One common assumption is that the outcome is deterministic and {{there is only one}} plausible future.

In-depth interviews among hospital administrators, laboratory technicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. Twenty-six hospital staff identified six key barriers and corresponding solutions to promote rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected inpatients with tuberculosis. These include revising systems of medication delivery, integrating care between inpatient and outpatient systems, training hospital nurses to counsel and initiate medications in inpatients, and cultivating a team approach to consistent guideline implementation. Most barriers identified by hospital staff were easily surmountable with reorganization, training, and policy changes at minimal cost.
