40|$|The {{trend to}} have more {{cooperative}} play and the increase of game dynamics in Robocup MSL League motivates the improvement of skills for ball passing and reception. Currently {{the majority of the}} MSL teams uses ball handling <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> <b>rollers</b> {{to have more}} precise kicks but limiting the capability to kick a moving ball without stopping it and grabbing it. This paper addresses the problem to receive and kick a fast moving ball without having to grab it <b>with</b> a <b>roller</b> based ball handling device. Here, the main difficulty is the high latency and low rate of the measurements of the ball sensing systems, based in vision or laser scanner sensors. Our robots use a geared leg coupled to a motor that acts simultaneously as the kicking device and low level ball sensor. This paper proposes a new method to improve the capability for ball sensing in the kicker, by combining high rate measurements from the torque and energy in the motor and angular position of the kicker leg. The developed method endows the kicker <b>device</b> <b>with</b> an effective ball detection ability, validated in several game situations like in an interception to a fast pass or when chasing the ball where the relative speed from robot to ball is low. This can be used to optimize the kick instant or by the embedded kicker control system to absorb the ball energy...|$|R
