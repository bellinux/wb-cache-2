25|$|Some {{important}} concepts: A {{formation is}} a formally named and defined <b>geologic</b> <b>unit</b> with unique characteristics. Those characteristics were created during a largely unbroken {{period of time}} and result from the specific depositional environment that the formation was laid down in. A member is a minor unit in a formation and a bed is a distinct subunit of a member. Groups are sets of formations that are related in significant ways such as, for example, all being deposited during a dry period that lasted millions of years or as the result of an ocean periodically flooding the same area over millions of years.|$|E

25|$|Medicine Rocks {{is part of}} the Fort Union Formation, a <b>geologic</b> <b>unit</b> {{containing}} coal, sandstone, and shale in Montana, Wyoming, {{and other}} adjacent states. About 61 million years ago, near the start of the Paleocene Epoch and during the late Zu√±i sequence, a freshwater river crossed what is now eastern Montana, flowing southeast into a prehistoric sea whose boundary was near far northwestern South Dakota (possibly the remains of the Western Interior Seaway). This river deposited large amounts of very fine-grained sand, which compacted into sandstone. On top of the freshwater sandstone was sand laid down by a saltwater estuary (indicated by the presence in this greyish layer of sandstone of burrows created by marine worms). Numerous fossils dating back 63.3 million years (to the Torrejonian North American Stage) {{can be found at the}} site, which help date the sandstone. These include several fossil snakes as well as teeth belonging to Plesiadapis anceps (an early primate-like mammal). The fossil remains of the primitive mammal Baiotomeus were discovered here in 1935.|$|E

50|$|In hydrology, throughflow, a {{subcomponent}} of interflow, is {{the lateral}} unsaturated {{flow of water}} in the soil zone, where a highly permeable <b>geologic</b> <b>unit</b> overlays a less permeable <b>geologic</b> <b>unit,</b> and which returns to the surface, as return flow, prior to entering a stream or groundwater.

40|$|Landslides in the {{hilly terrain}} along the Kansas and Missouri rivers in northeastern Kansas have caused {{millions}} of dollars in property damage during the last decade. To address this problem, a statistical method called multiple logistic regression has been used to create a landslide-hazard map for Atchison, Kansas, and surrounding areas. Data included digitized geology, slopes, and landslides, manipulated using ArcView GIS. Logistic regression relates predictor variables to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of landslides within geographic cells and uses the relationship to produce a map showing the probability of future landslides, given local slopes and <b>geologic</b> <b>units.</b> Results indicated that slope is the most important variable for estimating landslide hazard in the study area. <b>Geologic</b> <b>units</b> consisting mostly of shale, siltstone, and sandstone were most susceptible to landslides. Soil type and aspect ratio were considered but excluded from the final analysis because these variables did not significantly add to the predictive power of the logistic regression.

50|$|Raster-based stacked {{surfaces}} {{depict the}} surface of each buried <b>geologic</b> <b>unit,</b> and can accommodate data on lateral variations of physical properties. In this example from Soller and others (1999), the upper surface of each buried <b>geologic</b> <b>unit</b> was represented in raster format as an ArcInfo Grid file. The middle grid is the uppermost surface of an economically important aquifer, the Mahomet Sand, which fills a pre- and inter-glacial valley carved into the bedrock surface. Each <b>geologic</b> <b>unit</b> in raster format can be managed in the data model, in a manner not dissimilar from that shown for the stack-unit map. The Mahomet Sand is continuous in this area, and represents one occurrence of this unit in the data model. Each raster, or pixel, on the Mahomet Sand surface has a set of map coordinates that are recorded in a GIS (in the data model bin that is labeled ‚ÄúPixel coordinates‚Äù, which is the raster corollary of the ‚ÄúGeometry‚Äù bin for vector map data). Each pixel can have {{a unique set of}} descriptive information, such as surface elevation, unit thickness, lithology, transmissivity, etc.).|$|E

50|$|Vector-based stack-unit maps {{depict the}} {{vertical}} succession of <b>geologic</b> <b>units</b> to a specified depth (here, {{the base of}} the block diagram).

In a manner similar to that shown in figure 11, the stack-unit‚Äôs occurrence (the map unit‚Äôs outcrop), geometry (the map unit‚Äôs boundaries), and descriptors (the physical properties of the <b>geologic</b> <b>units</b> included in the stack-unit) are managed as they are for a typical 2-D geologic map.|$|R
