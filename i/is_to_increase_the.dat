5|$|A second option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} well-watered vegetation. These two options can be {{combined}} {{with the implementation of}} green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E

The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors {{to come forward and}} be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{properties}} of graphene and its few-layers <b>are</b> engineered <b>to</b> make them highly conductive. Two different approaches <b>were</b> implemented <b>to</b> achieve this goal. One approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> concentration of charge carriers by intercalation of acceptor FeCl 3 molecules between graphene planes. This resulted in a highly conductive yet transparent material which can be useful for applications. Another approach <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> mobility of carriers by means of removing surface contamination in the current annealing process. Optimal annealing parameters were found and a reproducible cleaning method was suggested...|$|R

5|$|The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> park's {{value and}} {{available}} money {{so that it}} can be sold and a new lot purchased from another part of the world to start a new theme park. Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park's location.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases {{to come out of}} solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} AH receptor {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal {{physiological function}}.|$|E

5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study <b>was</b> conducted <b>to</b> define temperature profiles of 22 x 5. 5, type 7, bias ply aircraft tires subjected to freely rolling, yawed rolling, and light braking conditions. Temperatures along the inner wall of freely rolling tires were {{greater than those}} near the outer surface. <b>The</b> effect of <b>increasing</b> tire deflection <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> temperature within the shoulder and sidewall areas of the tire carcass. The effect of cornering and braking <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> treat temperature.
