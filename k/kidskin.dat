The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

40|$|Sharon Kivland {{lives in}} the French countryside, though going {{frequently}} to London for discussion on philosophy, politics, and psychoanalysis. She remarks that Jean-Jacques, despite his many fine qualities, despite his declarations on moral and political equality, has a rather different programme of education for girls (of which she rather disapproves, for she cannot find a place there for herself) so she turns instead (naturally) from Emile to Choderlos de Laclos. An admirer of Rousseau, he nonetheless advocates, with fervour, the equality of the sexes, dwelling on ‘la femme-naturelle’, for whom only a revolution can change her current condition of slavery – and where there is slavery {{there can be no}} education (he adds).

50|$|<b>Kidskin</b> or kid leather {{is a type}} of soft, thin leather that is {{traditionally}} used for gloves (hence the phrase ',' used since at least 1888 as a metaphor for careful handling).

5000|$|Fashion Boots into Haute Couture. Herbert Levine {{is widely}} {{credited}} {{as the first}} label to have introduced boots into Haute Couture. As early as 1953, Herbert Levine introduced a calf-length boot in white <b>kidskin,</b> which sold poorly. Most retailers saw boots as a separate category of footwear from shoes, to be worn for protection from bad weather or for work. By contrast, Herbert Levine argued that boots were shoes and could {{be an integral part}} of a woman's outfit. In 1957, Herbert Levine produced an entire collection built around fashion boots, and despite widespread skepticism on the part of other designers and manufacturers, calf-high, kitten-heeled fashion boots for women began to grow in popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s. With fashion boots, Herbert Levine started a trend which remains current four decades later.|$|E
50|$|Fashion {{boots were}} revived {{in the early}} 1960s by {{designers}} such as Beth Levine, although at first they featured fashionable high heels such as the stiletto and kitten heels. The earliest go-go boots were mid-calf, white and flat-heeled, {{as seen in the}} work of the designer André Courrèges, who is often credited with creating the style. The simple minimalism of the Courrèges boot was easily and widely reproduced for the mass market. Courrèges boots provided the foundation for the development of the go-go boot, which increasingly came higher up the leg and was made in alternative colours. While remaining low-ish, the heel also became higher and chunkier. The earliest Courrèges boots were made of leather, such as <b>kidskin</b> or patent leather, but many of the subsequent versions and copies were made in PVC, vinyl, and other plastics.|$|E

She was carrying quicksilver, 130 tons of which the British removed and stored aboard the two vessels. The quicksilver was in <b>kidskin</b> bladders, which started leaking, either because of water damage or attempts by the crew to steal {{what they thought was}} silver. As a result, mercury vapor proceeded to disseminate throughout both vessels, causing extensive mercury poisoning among the crew, and killing animals aboard the vessels. Both went to Gibraltar where they underwent cleaning. In the case of the Phipps, the cleaning included boring a hole through the bottom of her hull to let the quicksilver drain out.|$|E

In 1962 Balenciaga's fall collection featured a tall boot by Mancini that just covered the knee; the following year Yves Saint Laurent's couture collection included thigh-length alligator skin boots by designer Roger Vivier and Vogue was able to announce that boots of all lengths were the look of the moment. The re-emergence of boots as a fashion item in the 1960s has been interpreted as an antidote to the femininity of Dior's post war [...] "New Look".|$|E
50|$|Some biographers, notably Ivor Brown and Anthony Burgess, {{followed}} Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown {{argued that}} she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,It is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold <b>kidskin</b> cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. Something, perhaps, quite different from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.|$|E

His creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of wartime rationing during World War II. Traditionally heels were built up with leather, but because of the rationing of leather, he experimented with wood and cork [...] The colors and design of this shoe still resemble modern shoe standards today. In the 1940s, platforms were designed with a high arch, but as exemplified here, they originated with the heel elevated only slightly above the toes. The platform brings a heavy looking foundation to the wearer that is in direct polarity to the stiletto heel. With its reconfiguration of the arch and structure of attenuated insubstantiality, the high heel suggests the ant gravitational effect of the dancer en pointe. On the contrary, the platform displays weightiness more like the flat steps of modern dance.|$|E
