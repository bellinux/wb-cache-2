40|$|Despite {{precipitation}} intensities may greatly vary {{during one}} flood event, {{detailed information about}} these intensities may {{not be required to}} accurately simulate floods with a hydrological model which rather reacts to cumulative precipitation sums. This raises two questions: to which extent is it important to preserve sub-daily precipitation intensities and how long does it effectively rain from the hydrological point of view? Both questions might seem straightforward to answer with a direct analysis of past precipitation events but require some arbitrary choices regarding the length of a precipitation event. To avoid these arbitrary decisions, here we present an alternative approach to characterize the <b>effective</b> length of <b>precipitation</b> event which is based on runoff simulations with respect to large floods. More precisely, we quantify the fraction of a day over which the daily precipitation has to be distributed to faithfully reproduce the large annual and seasonal floods which were generated by the hourly precipitation rate time series. New precipitation time series were generated by first aggregating the hourly observed data into daily totals and then evenly distributing them over sub-daily periods (n hours). These simulated time series were used as input to a hydrological bucket-type model and the resulting runoff flood peaks were compared to those obtained when using the original precipitation time series. We define then the <b>effective</b> daily <b>precipitation</b> duration as the number of hours n, for which the largest peaks are simulated best. For nine mesoscale Swiss catchments this <b>effective</b> daily <b>precipitation</b> duration was about half a day, which indicates that detailed information on precipitation intensities is not necessarily required to accurately estimate peaks of the largest annual and seasonal floods. These findings support the use of simple disaggregation approaches to make usage of past daily precipitation observations or daily precipitation simulations (e. g. from climate models) for hydrological modeling at an hourly time step...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{the climate}} in {{south-west}} Scandinavia is predominantly controlled by westerlies carrying moist Atlantic air, which forms a {{main source of}} precipitation in all seasons. Past variations in the ratio between precipitation and evaporation (<b>effective</b> <b>precipitation)</b> from terrestrial sites, however, may indicate changes {{in the degree of}} maritime influence. Palaeoclimatic archives in this region are thus ideally situated to study past changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. In this study, multi-proxy comparisons of records from three peat bogs and two lakes are used to reconstruct regional-scale variations of <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> in south-west Sweden during the Late Holocene. The total aeolian sediment influx into two peat bogs is used as a proxy for storm activity. The frequency of storm phases increases strongly after ca 2500 cal yrs BP. Dry conditions occur on a regional scale around 4800 - 4400, 2000 - 1700, 1300 - 1000, 700 - 500 and 300 - 100 cal yrs BP. In addition, a comparison to winter precipitation reconstructed from four Norwegian glaciers shows similar variations during the past ca 2000 years. This indicates that the climate in both regions was controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics of the North Atlantic region. The strong variability of <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> and storm activity after ca 2500 cal yrs BP indicates a highly variable climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Holocene {{changes in}} <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> (precipitation-evaporation; P-E) were reconstructed for the Sïndre Strïmfjord region of {{southwest}} Greenland using the sediment records of two neighbouring closed-basin ‘saline ’ lakes. Past lakewater conductivities (a proxy for P-E balance) were estimated using a diatom-inferred conductivity model. Broadly similar changes in both lake records corroborate {{the use of}} DI conductivity as a regional climate proxy. An increasing DI conductivity trend through the Holocene indicated net negative or balanced P-E ratios in this region, even {{during most of the}} Neoglacial period (post- 4000 yr BP). This contrasts with other regions of West Greenland, where conditions became more humid in the Neoglacial period. The reconstructions presented here therefore suggest a high degree of spatial variability in the P-E balance, likely caused by region-speci c orographic features. While interpret-ation of the mid-Holocene P-E balance was limited by dissolution of the diatom record, other sediment indicators suggest a period of extremely negative <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> (~ 7000 – 5600 yr BP), followed by a period of positive <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> lasting until 4700 yr BP. This contrasts markedly with the later Holocene, after c. 4000 yr BP, when high-frequency oscillations in DI conductivity probably re ect short-term climatic variations (ampli ed by in-lake processes connected with meromixis) but no long-term trends in the P-E balance...|$|E

We also calculated the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> by considering the antecedent precipitation. Both daily and <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> data were used as explanatory variables to explain LW export. The model selection revealed that the precipitation pattern and intensity controlling LW export varied with latitude in the Japanese archipelago. In small watersheds with narrow channel widths and low discharges, mass movements, such as landslides and debris flows, are major factors in the production and transport of LW. In this case, the <b>effective</b> <b>precipitation</b> required to initiate mass movements regulated the LW export and did not vary with the latitude. In intermediate and large watersheds with wide channel widths and high stream discharges, heavy rainfall and subsequent floods regulated buoyant depth, influencing the initiation of LW movement. In southern and central Japan, intense rainfall accompanied by typhoons or localized torrential downpours causes geomorphic disturbances, which introduce abundant pieces of LW into the channels. However, these pieces continue to be removed by repeated rainfall events. Therefore, LW export is supply-limited and potentially produces less LW accumulation. Conversely, in northern Japan, where typhoons and torrential downpours are rare, LW export is transport-limited because LW pieces recruited by bank erosion, tree mortality, and windthrow accumulate and persist on valley floors.

The Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) {{is one of the}} widely used indices, due to its high sensitivity and resilience. The basic form of the index is the ratio of the cumulative precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, for a specified reference period. The RDI is also transferred to a normalised and a standardised expression. Since the RDI incorporates both the main input and the main output of a natural water system, it is considered as an appropriate index of water availability.

40|$|Reactive {{absorption}} is {{a common}} process in the chemical industry and is used, among others, {{in the treatment of}} CO 2 containing industrial gas streams. The current work was a part of a project with the aim to assess new reactive solvents based on amino acid salts for CO 2 removal from industrial gas streams. Initially, a group of promising amino acid salts (taurine, sarcosine, L-proline, -alanine, 6 -aminohexanoic acid and DL-methionine) was screened for their CO 2 absorption kinetics, pKa values, CO 2 <b>effective</b> capacity, <b>precipitation</b> window and identity of the precipitates. Based on the results of this study, the (alkaline salt) of imino acid L-proline was chosen for further investigation. For this solvent, important characteristics like physico-chemical properties, CO 2 absorption kinetics, thermodynamic equilibria and energy consumption for a solvent regeneration (reboiler duty) were determined. The potential of L-proline and other (precipitating) amino acid salts solutions for CO 2 capture and utilization is still not fully explored and deserves further consideration...|$|R
