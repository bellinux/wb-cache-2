50|$|The TTAB is also {{responsible}} for hearing certain kinds of <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> <b>proceedings,</b> including oppositions to registration, cancellation proceedings against registered marks, and concurrent use proceedings where a party alleges its mark is entitled to joint registration, carving geographic territory out of that held by a registered mark.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inter</b> <b>partes</b> <b>proceedings</b> were {{initiated}} {{by members of}} the public, and said members of the public participate in the proceedings. The fee for filing a petition to institute an inter partes review was $27,200. On September 16, 2012, Leahy-Smith America Invents Act eliminated these proceedings and replaced them with two new post grant proceedings (Post-Grant Review and Inter Partes Review).|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} the first ten years of decisions by the Board Patent Appeals and Interferences regarding <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> patent reexamination appeals was conducted. The analysis of 101 cases focused on answering three broad questions: (1) How accurate are the specialist patent examiners of the Central Reexamination Unit of the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office? (2) Do patent owners or third party requestors fare better in appeals of decisions in <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> reexamination <b>proceedings?</b> (3) Which types of appeals {{are more likely to}} be successful? The examiners’ determinations were upheld more than three fourths of the time; third party requestors tended to be more successful than patent owners at winning appeals; and appeals solely by third party requestors of unadopted grounds of rejection were the most successful type of appeal. These historical observations can be used to predict the success rate for appeals of Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions in <b>Inter</b> <b>Partes</b> Review (IPR) <b>proceedings,</b> which was implemented in September 2012. Appeals of IPR decisions by third party requestors are predicted to have a better success rate at maintaining patent claim rejections and adding new grounds of rejection than appeals by patent owners will have at receiving reversal of patent claim rejections...|$|R

50|$|Lawsuits {{where all}} {{interested}} parties have been served with adequate notices and {{are given a}} reasonable opportunity to attend and to be heard {{are referred to as}} <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> <b>proceedings</b> or hearings. When a judgment is given, subject to any right of appeal, it would be inconvenient if the same issues could be endlessly relitigated by the same parties, so they are all bound by the result. However, anyone who was not a party to those proceedings and who can demonstrate a legitimate interest in reopening the issue, is entitled to petition the court for the right to be heard. However, in some circumstances, the judgment is given in rem, i.e. it binds everyone whether they were a party to the case or not.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 2006, the ECJ {{decided on}} case C-04/03 (GAT/LUK). The {{court ruled that}} [...] "Article 16(4) of the Convention … is to be {{interpreted}} as meaning that the rule of exclusive jurisdiction laid down therein concerns all proceedings relating to the registration or validity of a patent, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or a plea in objection". As of 2015, Article 16(4) of the Convention corresponds to Article 24(4) of EU regulation 1215/2012. The ruling in case C-04/03 confirms that the courts of each Contracting State have exclusive jurisdiction on validity of patents registered for the territory of that State. Exclusive jurisdiction under Article 22(4) applies irrespective of whether a patent proprietor is sued for revocation or whether an alleged infringer asserts invalidity in <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} studies Adequacy Decisions, the Safe Harbour and the Privacy Shield, under which transfers of personal {{data from the}} European Union to the United States are facilitated. The focus is on ‘redress mechanisms’, thus the mechanisms under which EU citizens can seek redress or compensation against violations of data protection rules. The research assesses the redress mechanisms of the Privacy Shield in the Light of the Court of Justice of the European Union case Schrems. Firstly the Safe Harbour Decision and its redress mechanisms are introduced. Then the Schrems case where the Safe Harbour was invalidated is analysed. Focus is on what the Court says about redress mechanisms, and the criteria that it establishes {{for the assessment of}} Adequacy Decisions. This criteria is then applied to the Privacy Shield redress mechanisms. According to the criteria, an Adequacy Decision must fulfil the requirements set out in Article 47 of the Charter of Funda-mental Rights, thus right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. The different redress mechanisms of the Privacy Shield are assessed in light of this Article by using case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as European Court of Human Rights. The study finds that all the redress mechanisms are not in line with Article 47. More specifically there are deficiencies in terms of the remedies available under different redress options, also all the procedures cannot be considered ‘fair’ as required by Article 47. More specifically, there is not always an opportunity for <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> <b>proceedings</b> or a reasoned decision. Also the independence and impartiality of some of the dispute resolution bodies is questionable. Moreover, the complexity of the Privacy Shield redress mechanisms may in some situations mean that the time of the proceedings may exceed what would be considered reasonable from the perspective of European law. The redress of mechanisms of the Privacy Shield rely heavily on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The compatibility with Article 47 of the Charter and ADR is not discussed as such, although the requirement of mandatory ADR before judicial dispute resolution is considered. Instead, the study asks whether the ADR mechanisms of the Privacy Shield could be compatible with Article 47. This study is done from a European perspective, thus focusing on EU fundamental rights. Study of laws of the United States are left outside the scope of the research, although some references are made. Similarly the study of redress mechanisms is limited to those introduced in the Privacy Shield and routes to seek redress in US courts are excluded. The aim of this study is thus to assess whether the Privacy Shield would pass the criteria established by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its Schrems case. The study takes a fundamental right perspective, although it does recognize that European data protection law does have other objectives other than the protection of personal data, such as economic objectives...|$|E

5000|$|Advocates {{argued that}} {{allowing}} a challenge of a patent {{in the first}} year after the issuance or reissuance of a patent would improve patent quality by allowing third party inputs. Opponents note that: (a) <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review under the Bill allows a third party to challenge the validity of any claim(s) in a patent *after* the first year; (b) re-exams are in fact used, not as an alternative to litigation, but rather as a supplement to litigation. In FY2008, 62% of current <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> re-exams and 30% of ex parte re-exams were simultaneously in litigation; (c) predatory corporations can and do file multiple post-grant oppositions against startup companies for the purpose of inflicting financial pain and through this practice have successfully extracted patent licensing and purchase agreements on favorable terms; [...] (d) the existing <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> process in a contested case now takes 34 to 53 months for an un-appealed reexam (assuming no “rework” by the patent office and no secondary appeals to the BPAI, the Federal Circuit, or the Supreme Court), and 5 to 8 years for appealed cases. [...] When Congress created <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> reexamination, it directed the USPTO to conduct these reexaminations with [...] "special dispatch." [...] The Bill expands the existing <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> procedure, addingdiscovery and a hearing in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Consequently, under the Bill, pendency of the <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> procedure will likely increase, despite the legislative fiat requiring 18 month disposition;and (e) the Bill all but requires a federal district court to stay a patent infringement suit copending with an <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review. [...] Because of the enormous costs and long pendency of <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review, the grant of a stay in a copending infringement suit could effectively be [...] "game over" [...] for the patent owner.|$|R

The drug companies targeted by Bass allege that the sole purpose of the validity challenges was to allow Bass to short the market and thus profit from the change in companies' stock prices.

40|$|In {{the roughly}} {{two years since}} <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review {{replaced}} <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> reexamination, petitioners have filed almost two-thousand requests for the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to review the validity of issued U. S. patents. As partial data on <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review (IPR) has trickled out via the blogosphere, interest from patent practitioners and judges has grown to a fever (and sometimes fevered) pitch. To date, however, no commentator has collected a comprehensive set of statistics on IPR. Moreover, what little data currently exists focuses on overall institution and invalidation rates — data that, alone, gives us little idea whether IPR is thus far accomplishing its original goal of serving as a quick, efficient alternative to defending patent suits filed in federal court, particularly those initiated by non-practicing entities (NPEs). This Essay aims to fill both gaps by reporting the findings of an empirical study tracking the outcome of IPRs {{and their impact on}} co-pending litigation. As described in greater detail below, we find that: Petitions for IPR are instituted for at least one challenged claim 84 percent of the time; Among instituted IPRs, all challenged claims are instituted 74 percent of the time; Among IPRs that reach a final decision on the merits, all instituted claims are invalidated or disclaimed more than 77 percent of the time; IPRs challenging NPE-owned patents {{are more likely to be}} instituted and, on average, are instituted for a larger share of challenged claims, but have their claims invalidated at a lower rate; Litigation proceeding in parallel with an instituted IPR is stayed about 82 percent of the time. Though it is too early to draw sweeping conclusions from these statistics, they suggest that <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> review promises to be considerably more potent than <b>inter</b> <b>partes</b> reexamination and, moreover, to have a substantial impact on co-pending patent litigation, particularly suits filed by NPEs...|$|R
