40|$|The Swedish Island of Gotland {{provides}} an interesting case of how renewable energy technologies {{can be combined}} and integrated into the electricity system. The study simulates the load, wind power production and PV power production to estimate the PV power potential for existing buildings on Gotland. The theoretical PV power potential on Gotland is calculated to be 667 MW. The PV power potential is split between 28 % for dwelling buildings, 9 % <b>for</b> <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings,</b> 7 % for industry and 56 % for other buildings. The current limit for wind power on Gotland is 195 MW. With the installed capacity of 194 MW wind power, an additional of 22 MW of PV power is possible to integrate without increasing the hours of overload on the power cable. With the prospected submarine power cable, a total of 529 MW PV power is possible to integrate with the existing 194 MW of wind power...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} goals {{established}} by Directive 2010 / 31 /EU of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council on the energy performance of buildings, the topics of energy efficiency in new and old buildings must be solved. Research and development of new energy solutions and technology are necessary for increasing energy performance of buildings. Three low-energy multi-dwelling buildings have been modelled and analyzed in the presented study. All multi-dwelling houses are made of similar single-family house cells. However, multi-dwelling buildings are of different geometry, flat number and height. DesignBuilder software was used for simulating and determining heating, cooling and electricity demand for buildings. Three different materials (silicate, ceramic and clay concrete blocks) as bearing constructions of external walls have been analyzed. To decrease cooling demand for buildings, the possibility of mounting internal or external louvers has been considered. Primary energy savings <b>for</b> <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> using passive solar measures have been determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{period between}} 1946 and 1980 {{was marked by}} the {{construction}} of large urban neighbourhoods of multi-dwelling buildings. These buildings represent {{a large part of}} the existing building stock. The conditions surveys show that they are often in inadequate state and that they do not meet the requirements of contemporary standards. In order to ensure adequate maintenance of such buildings, new legislature that introduces compulsory function of building manager was adopted recently. The manager is, among other duties, responsible for all maintenance works. Further, the new legislature of 2003 introduces a new way of collecting maintenance funds by establishing a special backup fund that can be used for maintenance activities only. As a consequence, it is expected that the trend of increased maintenance work and systematic approach to maintenance of multi-dwelling buildings will be enhanced. The thesis presents activities required for maintenance execution of multi-dwelling buildings together with all relevant legislature that need to be respected from both owner/tenant's and manager's side. The duties of various participants in the maintenance process, maintenance planning and financial plan preparation are discussed. Further, the responsibilities and relations between tenants/owners and manager are outlined. It is concluded that the level of maintenance <b>for</b> <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> and rational management of available financial means does not depend only upon the manager, but also upon owners/tenants and their supervision of the manager...|$|E
40|$|When {{different}} energy conserving {{measures are}} implemented for reducing energy use in {{buildings and the}} buildings are connected to district heating systems, {{it is important that}} an overall system analysis is made which takes into account the effects of total change of energy use due to the energy conserving measures. The method applied in this thesis uses hourly production data for the different production units in the district heating system in Gävle, Sweden. The merit order of the different production units is dependent on the electricity spot market price. To calculate the merit order, hourly data for the electricity price is used. The marginal production unit can then be determined for each hour of the investigated year. This thesis analyzes five different energy conserving measures in a <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>building</b> regarding how they affect the marginal production units in the district heating system. For CO 2 emission evaluations, two different combinations of heat and electricity conserving measures are compared to installation of an exhaust air heat pump. This thesis also analyzes how the configuration of the electric meter affects the measured amount of self-consumed and produced excess electricity for a single-family house and <b>for</b> two <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> of different sizes. The results show that the use of electricity is the most important objective to consider. The increased use of electricity for operation of the heat pump contributes to an increase of global CO 2 emissions and the electricity produced by the solar photovoltaic installation contributes to a decrease of global CO 2 emissions. The results also show that the configuration of the electric meter is important for the single-family house but negligible <b>for</b> the <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> The amount of produced excess electricity is high for all buildings, which means that the economic value of produced excess electricity is important for a profitable installation...|$|R

40|$|Environment {{has become}} a major concern for society, which {{awareness}} of the importance of an environmentally respectful development has been growing during the last decades. Economic reasons have encompassed this transition to a more planet friendly conception of human development. In fact, this transition has been parallel to the growing prices of fossil fuels, facing a clear perspective of a shortage on its availability, insufficient to cope with a growing demand in the near future. Within this context, the role of renewable energies in order to stop depending on fossil fuels and to reduce greenhouse gases emissions has become crucial.   Because of its climate, heating represents a major source of energy consumption in Sweden, accounting for almost 60 % of the residential and services sector energy use. Maximizing the efficiency of heating systems and using renewable, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable sources of energy may have an enormous impact on both environment and economy.   In this thesis the use of district heating and ground heat pump <b>for</b> a <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>building</b> is evaluated, both from the economic and environmental points of view. Both are recognized to be efficient heating systems, allowing important savings of other sources of energy, and respectful with the environment.   An installation combining both district heating and ground heat pump, <b>for</b> a <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>building</b> in Gävle has been analyzed. Different scenarios have been considered, and results obtained show that when installing a ground heat pump, both economic savings and CO 2 emissions reduction are obtained. Annual economic savings account for 16, 8 % when providing 60 % of the thermal energy with the ground heat pump, and considering the investment associated to the recent installation of a new heat pump (in the case studied, boreholes were already drilled), the payback time is 7, 4 years. CO 2 emissions reduction for a normal year reaches 34 %. However, {{if we look at the}} wider picture of electricity and heat production from a community (local, regional, national or even international) point of view, several considerations have to be taken into account, which are discussed in the report...|$|R

Not since year 1990 there has been estimates made {{of the amount of}} people that are exposed to certain vibration velocities from railway traf-fic in Sweden. Furthermore there has never been any transfer factors published for the transmission of vibrations between the ground and the foundation of buildings in Sweden. By measuring ground-borne vibrations in the ground while doing mea-surements in the foundation, data for 51 buildings have been collected from which comparison of transfer factors between ground and foundation have been possible. The data have been analysed as an overall, as well as according to building size and foundation type. The transfer factor between ground and foundation of a building was found to be 0. 83 as an overall mean. The majority of the transmission factors are in the range 0. 7 - 1. 1 and the transmission factor {{does not seem to be}} depen-dent on if the foundation type is suspended foundation or basement. Multi-dwelling buildings seems to have much lower transfer factor than one-dwelling buildings, but more data <b>for</b> <b>Multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> is needed to establish if this is statistically correct. In order to estimate the amount of people that are exposed to certain vibration velocities from railway traÿc in Sweden, almost 3 000 measurements of vibrations have been classified according to geology at the receiving building. A simple model have been made based on the attenuation of vibrations with distance and on the geology-classified data. Based on geological maps and a database of all properties close to railways, the total number of exposed individuals in Sweden could be estimated. The amount of people where the rms-weighted comfort values are exceeding the vibration levels 0. 4, 0. 7, 1. 0 and 1. 4 mm/s were estimated to 54 100, 25 000, 14 200 and 7 300 people respectively. The model for estimation of exposed people could be improved by using more precise soil class information and by including the soil class under the railway in the model. The model could be used to simplify analyses of vibration exposed buildings and to make rough estimates of what vibration level that might a˙ect a building...|$|E

The basic objective of management in <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings,</b> irrespective of socio-economic system, lies in providing operation, maintenance and preservation of essential qualities of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> in the manner that it serves its purpose during its lifetime. The main theme of thesis analyses management of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> from different perspectives in the countries of Slovenia, Switzerland and Germany. Comparison of the legislative framework {{in the field of}} <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> is carried out, particularly with regard to organizing management and decision making of the floor owners. Maintenance planning and collection of financial resources for the renovation are analysed as well. Given the demographic change (stagnation of population growth and aging) in selected countries, it is necessary to carry out the renovation of the existing housing fund. To this end, thesis analyses the ability of households to finance renovations of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> on their own. The results of the analysis are underpinned by data on the physical condition of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> and with details of construction activities at existing <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> In order to ensure economic (investment) and social (residence) function of the dwelling, the comparison of different methods to ensure neighbourhood harmony is carried out. The analysis of management in <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> in Slovenia, Switzerland and Germany shows that in terms of legislation there are no essential differences. Significant differences occur in the availability of suitable housing for each population strata. Thesis therefore highlights the problems caused by the mass privatization of social housing in Slovenia, which will have to be solved in order to establish effective management of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> As possible solutions, examples of good practice in the management of <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> in Switzerland and Germany are presented. ...|$|R

Today, these buildings and their envelopes are often deteriorated and do not fulfill the requirements of contemporary standards. Rehabilitation of buildings is often perferred to their demolition, consequently, increasing quantity of renovation works can be observed in all developed countries over the past decade. Limited financial funds are usually available for the rehabilitation, therefore a rational approach has to be employed if an appropriate and financially efficient rehabilitation is to be carried out.

The recast of EPBD directive is expected to increase the role of the LCC analysis in the design of energy-efficient construction and the inclusion of such analysis in the frameworks of national policies. Housing Fund – public fund of the Municipality Ljubljana in 2007 carried out an energy efficient renovation of existing <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>building</b> and selected Steletova building as a case study.

40|$|The {{housing sector}} of today {{represents}} for almost 40 % {{of the energy}} consumption, an energy consumption of which the major part consists of non-renewable energy sources. This is not sustainable and utilization of new energy-efficient technologies in buildings can be {{a step in the}} right direction, towards a sustainable energy society. This report has been made on behalf of and in cooperation with Älvstranden Utveckling AB in Gothenburg to examine how future energy-efficient technologies can affect the energy demand in energy-efficient <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> The report is based on Älvstrandens passive house, Hamnhuset, a house whose energy consumption is far below the BBR's requirements. The report looks at the opportunities for improvement within windows, insulation, solar energy technologies, as well as white goods. Computer simulations are then made to apply the selected technologies into a reference building. Technologies are selected from an energy efficient perspective and no account has been taken of other aspects such as the economy. They must also be available on the market within a ten-year period. Information has been gathered through interviews and contacts with experts in their respective fields, as well as representatives of the various technologies. By using high-efficient insulation and smart windows, heat transmission losses and thus the heat demand can be reduced. Increased solar irradiation through the windows during the winter months also contributes to a reduction in need of purchased energy during the coldest part of the year, when the supply of renewable energy is minimal. A large part of the needed electricity may be covered by electricity from solar cells mounted on the roof, balcony fronts and facades. A reduction of purchased electricity has a major impact on the building's stress on the environment and carbon dioxide emissions from a life cycle perspective. That is also why electricity heated white goods are exchanged into appliances on district heating. By installing a larger amount of and more efficient solar collectors which also has a smoother heat production over the year, the need for heating domestic hot water is reduced. The calculations are made in two stages, the first sets out the various technologies effectiveness and potential individually; several simulations have been made for one and the same technology to provide different variations depending on the situation it is used. For example, several combinations of windows are tested in different orientations. In step two, the techniques with the greatest energy saving potential are selected in order to jointly result in a final house. To see how a future streamlining of household technology and lighting affects the energy balance of a building, a simulation is also made where household electricity is reduced by 40 %. The result of selected energy efficiency measures shows a reduction of the specific energy demand by 70 % compared to the BBR's requirements and 50 % compared to the reference house. In addition the environmental impact of the building reduces from a CO 2 perspective with 85 % compared to the reference house. However, there is an uncertainty of the results as they are based on speculations in the technologies future capacity. Results should therefore be seen as an inspiration for how high the objectives can be set in the construction of energy-efficient buildings. Still, in the light of this report, there are great opportunities to within a ten-year period build <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings</b> that are way more energy efficient than today...|$|R

However, the term [...] "conversion" [...] is usually reserved for just those projects which involve changing the title (and sometimes also the use) of an existing structure, such as a <b>multi-dwelling</b> apartment <b>building,</b> row dwellings (townhomes) or a commercial multi-unit rental site.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore ways of enhancing the overall lifetime quality, including cost and environmental efficiency, of Swedish concrete <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> The building and its characteristics, {{as well as the}} procedures for whole life optimisation, are addressed. The methods developed are general for buildings, while the application is specific. The fundamental characteristics (attributes) of dwelling buildings are reviewed, and a set of design criteria relating to these is compiled. Furthermore, the properties of concrete with regard to the attributes are analysed. The concept of Integrated Life Cycle Design is applied as methodological platform. By integrated life cycle design the traditional design procedure, is supplemented by life cycle appraisal and methods to optimise the building with regard to several more or less interacting parameters. A pilot toolbox for integrated life cycle design of residential buildings is developed and verified. This contains a set of design criteria addressing the fundamental attributes, modules for life cycle costing, energy balance calculation, structural and acoustic pre-design, environmental assessment and feed-back routines. The environmental assessment is based on a socio-economic cost estimation, relating to energy consumption during the user phase. Energy use for production and demolition are also taken into account, but only as average values. For the concrete building frame, a full LCA model, regarding the production phase is also developed. For the ranking of technical alternatives, in relation to the priorities of the client, ?Multiple Attribute Decision Analysis?, ?MADA?, was also included in the study and in the toolbox. The Integrated Life Cycle Design toolbox is tested and further developed by the application on eight real cases. A comparative desktop study on the resulting lifecycle consequences, from different functional quality levels is also undertaken. It was concluded that integrated life cycle design may enhance the lifetime quality and cost effectiveness of buildings and thus deserves introduction in practice. The life cycle appraisal tools and data are available and calculations can be done with reasonable effort, giving reliable results. The application examples show how integrated life cycle design can guide design decisions towards the optimal building with regard to specific priorities of the client...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the situation for}} energy efficiency of existing housing in Sweden with focus on major retrofitting and transformation projects of post-war boom era multi-dwelling housing managed by public housing companies. The built environment has been pointed out as a key area for Sweden’s societal energy savings. The objectives for energy efficiency are 20 % reduction by 2020 and 50 % reduction by 2050. The housing sector use about 40 % of the societal energy of which a high proportion is heating. Sweden has large stocks of technically deteriorating multi-dwelling housing from the so called million homes programme 1965 – 1970. Of these, 38 % are public housing and use district heating. In the coming ten year period about 300. 000 {{are in need of}} technical retrofitting. As major retrofitting projects are scarce and only carried out in 30 to 40 years cycles, {{it is important that the}} right decisions are taken. Many of these dwellings are found in areas with social problems and the owners and managers of the stocks work under strained economic conditions. The challenge to find solutions applicable on the broad scale also adaptable for tight budgets is urgent. The paper gives an overview of the Swedish housing sector: heating systems, fuels and energy use in relation to owner categories, forms of tenure and years of construction; and a presentation of policy instruments for decreased energy use and conversion from fossil fuels and electricity to bio-fuels or district heating. Further two case studies of demonstration projects of housing form the million homes programme are presented. The results show that few policy instruments have targeted <b>multi-dwelling</b> <b>buildings.</b> There have been opportunities for funding for renewal combining energy, environmental, and social aims. Energy performance declarations do not seem to a strong driver for energy efficiency among owners or tenants. Individual projects show that the potential for energy efficiency with existing technology is high. However, there is an efficiency gap between what is possible and what is implemented on the large scale where technical knowledge among owners and economy are major hindrances. The study points out the need for further studies of the decisive function of public housing companies in relation to retrofitting of existing housing, their routines, competences, and drivers and the possibility for shared knowledge resources among non-competitive clients. Further the paper {{discusses the}} hindrance of short-term economy and points out the benefit of raised municipal or governmental involvement as energy efficient retrofitting often are part of transformation processes which have been linked to wider societal benefit (e. g. lowered crime rates and unemployment) ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the frames}} {{of the project}} of {{establishing}} a price index for new multidwellings, a survey for the collection of data has was conducted. Data have been collected from 2011, with a “test” quarter in 2010. Based on the data material, we have constructed a price model that adjust for quality differences, for small houses (semi-detached houses, row houses etc.) and dwellings in blocks of flats. The model adjusts for area, ownership, price zones, garage, floor for flats and some important interactions. The results show {{that there has been}} an increase in the prices <b>for</b> new <b>multi-dwellings</b> of 27 per cent in the period from the 1 st quarter of 2011 to the 4 th quarter of 2015. In the initial phases data for detached houses were collected in order to explore the possibilities to include them in the survey, but it turned out that they were highly underrepresented in the data material. However, the already existing output price index for new detached houses has been used to obtain a separate index for detached houses. An outline of the methodology for the aggregated index for new dwellings is given...|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 6, 677, 000 apartment housing units in South Korea. Exterior wall painting <b>for</b> such <b>multi-dwelling</b> apartment housings in South Korea represents a typical area to which construction automation {{technology can be}} applied for improvement in safety, productivity, quality, and cost over the conventional method. The conventional exterior wall painting is costly and labor-intensive, and it especially exposes workers to significant health and safety risks. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to design a conceptual model of an exterior wall painting robot which is applicable to apartment housing construction and maintenance, and to conduct its technical?economical feasibility analyses. In this study, a design concept using a high ladder truck is proposed as the best alternative for automation of the exterior wall painting. Conclusions made in this study show that the proposed exterior wall painting robot is technically and economically feasible, and can greatly enhance safety, productivity, and quality compared to the conventional method. Finally, it is expected that the conceptual model of the exterior wall painting robot would be efficiently used in various applications in exterior wall finishing and maintenance of other architectural and civil structures such as commercial buildings, towers, and high-rise storage tanks...|$|R
