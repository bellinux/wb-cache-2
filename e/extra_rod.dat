25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed. The <b>extra</b> <b>rod</b> worth was {{in part due to}} the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the prototype reactor core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds. That was too fast for the heat from the fuel to get through the aluminum cladding and boil enough water to fully stop the power growth {{in all parts of the}} core via negative moderator temperature and void feedback.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and create a process for manufacturing replacement glass prisms for the Piedras Blancas lighthouse and several other lighthouses nationwide. The prisms were designed to be in multiple metal arrays spread across {{the floor of the}} beacon room (the topmost room of the lighthouses). The prisms functioned to transmit extra, radiant light from the beacon light through the floor of the beacon room and disperse it into the maintenance room below. Using computer aided drafting (CAD) software, an original prism was measured and modeled; the corresponding mold was also modeled. G-codes for controlling the movement of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill were created to machine the two halves of the mold. A donated block of graphite was machined according to the developed G-codes. As a proof of concept method for casting these prisms, I used a lampworking setup – consisting of a propane-oxygen torch, the associated hoses, regulators, and tanks, an annealing kiln, and the necessary lampworking tools – to melt one end of a borosilicate glass rod into a large gather of molten glass. I forced this gather into the mold, thereby filling the mold, and allowed the glass to solidify. Then I opened the mold, removed the prism, melted off the <b>extra</b> <b>rod,</b> and flattened the top face of the prism. This method, although suitable for the proof of concept, will not be efficient for casting the needed quantity of prisms due to the additional, time consuming steps required. For producing large quantities of these prisms, suggested future work may involve pouring molten glass into the mold via the use of a crucible...|$|E
40|$|A {{phase shifter}} in an alumina woodpile {{electromagnetic}} bandgap (EBG) defect waveguide that operates at microwave frequencies is demonstrated. The phase shift is introduced by sequentially adding low dielectric constant rods to the voids directly above the defect waveguide. The {{addition of the}} <b>extra</b> <b>rods</b> creates selected phase delay without significantly affecting the transmission performance of the woodpile waveguide. Measured and computed results in Ku-band are presented to confirm {{the performance of the}} device. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report the}} case of a 28 -year old male who {{presented}} with a compound diaphyseal fracture of the tibia, which was treated with intramedullary nailing. Postoperatively he required an extensive fas-ciotomy for an acute compartment syndrome. The fracture evolved towards post-traumatic osteomyeli-tis, growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), combined with a large overlying soft tissue gap. An Ilizarov frame was used to treat both the bone and the skin defect. The infected fracture was treat-ed by resection and longitudinal bone transport. Meanwhile, the skin was gradually closed using <b>extra</b> <b>rods</b> on the frame, allowing for a transverse ‘skin transport’. Both the bone and the soft tissues healed without further complications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Several {{different}} growing rod {{techniques have}} been described in the literature to treat progressive scoliosis in young children. Nevertheless, none of these techniques has shown a real superiority, {{and the rate of}} complications remains high. The purpose of this report is to describe an original fusionless method of treatment for this problem. Materials and methods: The 3 hooks- 2 screws (H 3 S 2) construct consists of a single 5. 5 mm titanium rod with three hooks proximally and two monoaxial pedicle screws distally, and some <b>extra</b> length of <b>rod</b> located distally and/or proximally {{that can be used for}} future lengthenings. To date, a total of 103 H 3 S 2 constructs have been performed in our institution. This paper reports the preliminary results on 38 patients, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Results: This procedure was found to be effective in maintaining scoliosis correction while allowing continued spinal growth and was associated with a low rate of complications. Conclusions: The H 3 S 2 construct was found to have several advantages over the growing rod techniques as previously described in the literature. These include no need for post-operative bracing, fewer lengthening procedures and a lower rate of complications. © 2014 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
