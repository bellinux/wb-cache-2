40|$|Insulin-like growth factor I, encoded by the IGF-I gene, {{plays a role}} in cell {{growth and}} differentiation, embryogenesis, {{metabolism}} regulation, skeletal growth, and protein synthesis. The aims of this study were to investigate the polymorphism in the 5 ′ flanking region of the IGF-I gene and evaluate associations between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this gene and growth, body size, carcass and meat quality traits in Coloured Polish Merino sheep. In total 78  live and post mortem traits were investigated. Polymorphism in the IGF-I gene was identified {{with the use of the}} polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 305  Coloured Polish Merino sheep. In association studies, traits of interest were analysed with the use of the MIXED and GENMOD procedures of the SAS statistical package. Two alleles named A and B, and two IGF-I genotypes – AA and AB – were detected. The A allele and the AA genotype were predominant, with the frequencies of 91. 6  and 83. 3  %, respectively. The IGF-I genotype was found to have a highly significant effect on <b>fore</b> <b>shank</b> weight (P  [*]=[*]  0. 006), kidney fat class (P  [*]=[*]  0. 002) and EUROP fat class (P  [*]=[*]  0. 005). Furthermore, the IGF-I genotype significantly affected external fatness of carcass class (P  [*]=[*]  0. 038), drip loss (P  [*]=[*]  0. 049), and subjective assessment of meat colour (P  [*]=[*]  0. 043), and it tended to be associated with longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle width (P  [*]=[*]  0. 063) and flavour (0. 067). Concluding, the IGF-I gene could be considered as a candidate gene of selected carcass and meat quality traits in sheep...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the meat yield {{breeding}} values of sires on highly valued parts of carcasses in their progeny. The study was carried out on Czech Fleckviehs, a breed dual purpose milk-beef production. Cutting parts evaluated were: round, strip loin and tender loin (first-class meat); rib, shoulder blade (boneless), <b>fore</b> <b>shank,</b> flank, chuck roll + neck (second-class meat) and separable fat. The correlation analysis showed significant negative relationships only for the relative breeding values of trading classes and the rib (r=− 0. 2079); relative breeding values of net daily gain with strip loin (r=− 0. 2433). Although strip loin is an important first-class meat cut, the correlation is rather low. Correlations between other meat cuts with breeding values were non-significant. The correlation between meat cuts and age showed the same pattern as correlations between meat cuts and weight at slaughter. Significant negative correlations were found between first-class meat and increasing age (r=− 0. 1979) and weight (r=− 0. 2884). In contrast, for second-class meat there were positive correlation with increasing age and weight (r= 0. 3489 for age, r= 0. 4495 for weight). This also corresponds with the correlation between age or weight and specific first-class meat cuts (tender loin r=− 0. 2804, r=− 0. 3413, strip loin r=− 0. 3710, r=− 0. 2012) and second-class meat (sep. fat r=+ 0. 2360, r=+ 0. 2951, r for correlation with age and weight respectively). Based on the calculations of canonical analysis 27. 75 % explained variability was found for variables relative breeding value of net daily gain (RBVndg), relative breeding value of trading class (RBVtc), age and weight using a linear combination of variables for individual cuts. At the same time, 14. 25 % explained variability was found for cut variables which can be expressed using linear combinations of RBVndg, RBVtc, age and weight...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{quantify}} basic feedlot performance and carcass value characteristics of Holstein bulls slaughtered as “young cattle” at 300 kg of live weight. The observation {{was carried out in}} a group of 12 Holstein bulls fattened in identical conditions and fed on a diet consisting of ad libitum amount of crushed grain (barley and wheat) and a limited amount of protein concentrate. The mean overall values were as follows: age and live weight at slaughter 275. 9 days and 299. 3 kg, daily weight gain and net weight gain since birth 0. 962 kg and 0. 527 kg, dressing percentage 48. 3 %, weight of cold right carcass half 71. 0 kg, weight of bones 17. 5 kg, weight of muscle 53. 0 kg and separable fat 0. 54 kg. The mean weight of hide was 21. 6 kg. The great majority of calves were classified as O 2, one calf graded R 2. The forequarter to hindquarter ratio was 1. 4 with mean weights 29. 1 kg and 41. 9 kg. The mean weight of neck was 3. 9 kg, chuck 3. 6 kg, shoulder 5. 9 kg, <b>fore</b> <b>shank</b> 3. 4 kg, loin 4. 1 kg, filet 1. 5 kg, round 18. 2 kg and hind shank 1. 3 kg. We found highly significant (P< 0. 01) coefficients of correlation between carcass weight and live weight at slaughter (r= 0. 963) or daily weight gain (r= 0. 723). Net weight gain since birth was highly significantly (P< 0. 01) correlated to live weight at slaughter (r= 0. 723) or to daily weight gain (r= 0. 982) and significantly correlated (P< 0. 05) to age at slaughter (r= – 0. 665). Despite the average or worse-than-average feedlot performance parameters our experimental Holstein bulls had an adequate proportion of muscle (comparable with other literature sources), a high ratio of bones and a very low proportion of fat. Thanks to small meat trim, weights of the main dissection parts of fore-and hindquarters were comparable to those usually found in young Holstein bulls...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effect of diets containing levels of linseed oil in the performance, carcass characteristics, weight, yield of cuts of meat, and meat quality of heifers and steers Nellore x Canchim. Fifteen 24 -monthold steers (427. 80 ± 40. 59 kg) and fourteen 24 -month-old heifers (400. 57 ± 32. 57 kg, average body weight) were confined in individual pens, receiving diets with 80 % of concentrated, sugar cane as exclusive roughage and increasing levels of linseed oil (1. 0, 3. 8 and 5. 2 % on a DM basis). The experiment was designed in an incomplete random blocks one, in a factorial scheme of 3 x 2 (type of diet and sexual condition). The initial weight of animals was used as co-variable and the blocks were considered as the randomizing effect. All of the animals of every block were slaughtered once they reached an average body weight of 500 kg; this resulted in 96 days of feedlot for two blocks, 110 days for other two blocks and 138 days for one block, after 28 days of adaptation. Dry matter consumption by animals, in kg and body weight percentage, was reduced (P< 0. 05), accompanied with higher daily weight gains, an improvement in feed efficiency {{and an increase in}} the Longissimus eye area in the carcass with an elevation of oil levels in diets, without differences between sex conditions. The backfat thickness increased with higher linseed oil levels on the diet and results differed between sex conditions, with higher values for heifers (12. 17 mm) in relation to steers (8. 58 mm). The weight of meat cuts such as the shoulder clod, complete top sirloin butt (top sirloin butt + top sirloin cap + bottom sirloin butt), strip loin and top round, as well as the sum of the noble meat cuts (top sirloin butt + strip loin + full tenderloin), less noble meat cuts (chuck roll + chuck mock tender + shoulder clod + <b>fore</b> <b>shank</b> and shank + hump + point half brisket + neck + outside round), barbecue [...] . Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar dietas contendo teores de óleo de linhaça sobre o desempenho, as características da carcaça, o peso, o rendimento de cortes cárneos, e a qualidade da carne de fêmeas e machos castrados Nelore x Canchim. Quinze machos castrados (427, 80 ± 40, 59 kg) e 14 fêmeas (400, 57 ± 32, 57 kg, em média de peso corporal), com 24 meses de idade foram confinados, recebendo dietas com 80 % de concentrado, cana-de-açúcar como volumoso exclusivo e teores crescentes de óleo de linhaça (1, 0; 3, 8 e 5, 2 % da MS). O delineamento experimental foi em blocos incompletos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 (dietas e condição sexual), sendo o peso inicial dos animais utilizado como covariável e os blocos como efeito aleatório. Todos os animais de cada bloco foram abatidos quando o peso corporal médio atingiu 500 kg; assim, o tempo de confinamento foi de 96 dias para dois blocos, 110 dias para dois blocos e 138 dias para um bloco, após 28 dias de adaptação. O consumo de matéria seca pelos animais, em kg/dia e % do peso corporal, foi reduzido (P< 0, 05), acompanhado de maiores ganhos de peso, melhora da eficiência alimentar e aumento da área de olho de lombo na carcaça com a elevação dos teores de óleo nas dietas, sem diferenças entre as condições sexuais; a espessura de gordura de cobertura na carcaça foi crescente com o aumento dos teores de óleo de linhaça na dieta e diferiu entre as condições sexuais, com maiores valores para as fêmeas (12, 17 mm) em relação aos macho castrados (8, 58 mm). Os pesos dos cortes da paleta, alcatra completa (alcatra + picanha + maminha), contrafilé e coxão mole, e as somatórias dos cortes nobres (alcatra completa + contrafilé + filé mignon), de segunda (acém + peixinho + paleta + músculos do dianteiro e traseiro + cupim + ponta de peito + pescoço + coxão duro), para churrasco [...] ...|$|E
