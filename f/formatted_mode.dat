50|$|The VT105 was broadly {{similar to}} the VT55, but added a number of {{additional}} features. One was a square <b>format</b> <b>mode</b> that reduced the display horizontally by eight character widths and extended it vertically by one line {{to make it more}} square than the original layout. This left additional room on the left for eight characters instead of a single vertical column, improving label displays. The VT105 also changed the meaning of register 0's bits slightly; bit 1 and 2 no longer turned on and off the entire graph, but the display of the graph points themselves. This allowed the display to make a line, a shaded histogram, or a histogram with a brighter line on top. In comparison, on the VT55 the graph bit controlled the display of the entire dataset, not just the line itself, so turning off the graph bit would make the histogram disappear as well.|$|R

40|$|Content {{adaptation}} {{with respect}} to different devices technical constrains is often a necessary step to make content usable. Moreover, {{in the field of}} Language Learning, content adaptation to different devices involves rather peculiar issues, if compared to other domains. Every teaching module is made up of different interconnected components: the educational technique, the abilities and competences it aims to develop and the activity type implementing the technique. It must however be kept in mind that adaptation may involve changes in terms of <b>format,</b> <b>mode</b> or type of activity which can result in alterations as regards the abilities the content was originally developed for. In this paper we deal with these issues and introduce our approach to address them, in particular as regards content to be delivered through the CLiRe online language learning environment. Our approach consists in the design of micro-content that can be processed by an ontology representing the above mentioned relationships and by means of reasoning mechanisms capable of deciding which changes need to be done to adapt a given content to a specific device...|$|R
