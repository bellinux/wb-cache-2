40|$|Abstract—The <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> {{has long}} been the {{dominant}} component in a video decoder in terms of energy, area, and latency. We proposed a non-combined <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> motion compensation (CFMMC) for video decoding which facilitates the characteristic of the perfect-matched macroblock (MB) to avoid unnecessary memory access and to save energy. The statistic result confirms that some sequences have more than 70 % of MBs being perfect-matched MB. The CFMMC hardware architecture is further evaluated for latency, area, and energy. The hardware architecture shows that with SRAM-base <b>frame</b> <b>memory,</b> the equivalent gate count can be reduced by 37. 7 %, and the energy consumption and the latency may also be improved for sequences with enough percentage of perfect-matched MBs. Since the ben-efit of the CFMMC is highly dependent on the percentage of perfect-matched MBs, it is best suited for applications with large portion of static background, such as video surveillance, video telephony, and video conferencing.

40|$|Abstract—For mobile video applications, the {{required}} storage and bandwidth of <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> play crucial roles. Reducing the accesses {{and the size}} of <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> can decrease area and cost, as well as power consumption. Current video-coding standards can reach high compression efficiency but demand large volumes of computations and storage requirements. Hence, it is hard for these coding standards to be embedded into an H. 264 decoder. In this brief, a novel embedded lossy compression scheme is proposed. With a compression ratio at 2, it compresses a 4 × 2 size block into 32 bit with peak-signal-to-noise-ratio loss of 1. 27 ∼ 3. 94 dB compared with H. 264. A pipelined architecture is also proposed to realize both the compressor and the decompres-sor in 2 cycles and 1 cycle, respectively. This cost-effective solution requires a gate count of 4. 9 k and power consumption of 244 μW in a 90 -nm standard complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor process, making it very suitable for mobile video applications.

In the past, many architectures were proposed aimed at providing high – speed 3 -D DWT computation with the requirement of utilizing a reasonable amount of hard ware resources. These architectures can be broadly classified into separable and non separable architectures. The separable method is the most straight forward implementation method. In separable method, a 3 -D filtering operations, one for processing the data row-wise and the other column-wise. In this method the intermediate coefficients stores in a <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> first. Then it performs 1 -D DWT in other direction with these intermediate coefficients to complete one-level 3 -D DWT. Because the size of this <b>frame</b> <b>memory</b> is usually assumed to off chip. However, the separable method performs 1 -D DWT in both directions simultaneously. In this paper, separable pipeline architecture for fast computation of the 3 -D DWT with a less memory and low latency is proposed. The low latency and less memory is achieved by proper designing of three 1 -D DWT filtering processes and also efficiently transferring the data between the three 1 -D DWT filters...|$|E
