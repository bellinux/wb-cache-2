5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for <b>grooming,</b> such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive <b>grooming</b> needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to <b>grooming</b> and the number of <b>grooming</b> bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
5|$|In African antelopes, {{the lateral}} dental <b>grooming</b> {{apparatus}} {{does not appear}} to be used during grazing or browsing. Instead, it is used during <b>grooming</b> when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats also {{engage in}} social <b>grooming.</b> It usually occurs between females and their offspring, {{but it is}} also {{significant}} between adult females. Social <b>grooming</b> is mostly associated with food sharing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Groom</b> is a surname of English origin. Its English usage {{comes from}} the trade or profession, a person {{responsible}} for the feeding and care of horses, {{not to be confused}} with the much more socially distinguished roles in the English Royal Household of <b>Groom</b> of the Chamber, or <b>Groom</b> of the Privy Chamber, <b>Groom</b> of the Robes, <b>Groom</b> of the Stole, and <b>Groom</b> of the Stool.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is <b>grooming</b> the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This takes into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of <b>grooming</b> and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} lemurs, the ruffed lemur has special adaptations for <b>grooming,</b> {{including}} a toilet-claw on its second toe, and a toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the <b>grooming</b> {{hypothesis}} {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for <b>grooming,</b> and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that <b>grooming</b> plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E
50|$|The bride's father {{places the}} right hand of the bride on that of the <b>groom</b> as a {{symbolic}} gesture of handing over the bride to the <b>groom.</b> The <b>groom's</b> brother hands over a tray with seven sheaves of betel leaves with a coin placed in each. The <b>groom</b> holds the tray while the bride takes one leaf {{at a time and}} drops it on the Poruwa. The <b>groom</b> then repeats this process. The <b>groom's</b> brother hands a gold necklace to the <b>groom</b> who in turn places it on the bride's neck. The maternal uncle enters the Poruwa and ties the small fingers of the bride and <b>groom</b> with a single gold thread (to symbolize unity) and then pours water over the fingers. Six girls will then bless the marriage with a traditional Buddhist chant (Jayamangala Gatha). The <b>groom</b> presents to his bride a white cloth which in turn is presented to the bride's mother. This is an expression of the <b>groom's</b> gratitude to his mother-in-law.|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, the {{procession}} of the <b>groom's</b> family is led in specific order. The first person would be the representative of the <b>groom's</b> house followed by the <b>groom's</b> father, the <b>groom,</b> then the rest of his family and close friends.|$|R
50|$|A {{member of}} the General Synod of the Anglican Church, <b>Groom</b> was knighted in January 1924 for his {{services}} to politics. In 1984, his old seat of Darling Downs was renamed the Division of <b>Groom</b> in his honour. He is commemorated {{by a number of}} features in Toowoomba, including <b>Groom</b> Park. <b>Groom's</b> elder brother, Henry Littleton <b>Groom,</b> was a long serving {{member of the}} Queensland Legislative Council.|$|R
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of <b>grooming,</b> although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur <b>grooming</b> seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time <b>grooming.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a <b>grooming</b> function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. <b>Grooming</b> was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one <b>grooming</b> claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished <b>grooming,</b> the cycle will repeat.|$|E
50|$|Dorja Dhara- This is {{done when}} the bride reaches the <b>groom's</b> house. One dish is made full with alta and milk. The bride stands on it, then {{enters the room}} with <b>groom.</b> Before entering, the <b>groom's</b> brother {{prevents}} <b>groom</b> and asks him when {{he is going to}} bring bride for him(the brother). Once the <b>groom</b> promises him about his bride, he leaves the door.|$|R
50|$|A BSP Master and {{multiple}} <b>grooms</b> are {{started by the}} script. Then, the bsp master starts up with a RPC server for <b>groom</b> servers. <b>Groom</b> servers starts up with a BSPPeer instance and a RPC proxy to contact the bsp master. After started, each <b>groom</b> periodically sends a heartbeat message that encloses its <b>groom</b> server status, including maximum task capacity, unused memory, and so on.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Groom</b> Server (shortly {{referred}} to as <b>groom)</b> {{is a process that}} performs bsp tasks assigned by BSPMaster. Each <b>groom</b> contacts the BSPMaster, and it takes assigned tasks and reports its status by means of periodical piggybacks with BSPMaster. Each <b>groom</b> is designed to run with HDFS or other distributed storages. Basically, a <b>groom</b> server and a data node should be run on one physical node.|$|R
5|$|Although sea otters can be {{playful and}} sociable, {{they are not}} {{considered}} to be truly social animals. They spend much time alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, <b>grooming,</b> and defense.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time <b>grooming</b> each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their <b>grooming</b> claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. <b>Grooming</b> of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily <b>grooming.</b>|$|E
50|$|In September 2007, the {{competition}} was called Three Strangers and a Wedding, where this time the bride was found first instead of the <b>groom</b> and two possible <b>grooms</b> were chosen. The bride then chose her <b>groom</b> when she met both <b>grooms</b> {{for the first time}} at the altar.|$|R

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs {{one out of every}} three days. During social <b>grooming</b> (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and <b>grooming</b> sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E
5|$|Social {{meetings}} {{are marked by}} mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, <b>grooming</b> one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during <b>grooming.</b> Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a <b>grooming</b> claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed <b>grooming</b> claws.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for <b>grooming.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus {{exhibits}} microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos {{is generally}} considered {{to function as a}} toothcomb, but {{due to the lack of}} striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral <b>grooming,</b> its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular <b>grooming.</b> Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
50|$|Brazilian wedding ceremonies {{normally}} follow Christian traditions closely. The {{bride and}} <b>groom</b> recite wedding vows {{to each other}} after a prayer is read.
