40|$|Eccentric (lengthening) {{resistance}} training respectively muscle work requires a lower share of cardiac activity {{in comparison to}} concentric (shortening) muscle work. Especially in seniors suffering from cardiovascular diseases (still {{the most common cause}} of death in industrialized countries) this kind of activity is predisposed due to its possibility of high stimulation of musculoskeletal system only partly (20 - 25 %) stimulating cardiovascular system. Comprehension of positive aspects was addressed for a sample of people doing regular work out while having access to concentric and <b>eccentric</b> training <b>stations.</b> 38 females (57 ± 15. 7 years / 163. 3 ± 19. 4 cm / 63. 6 ± 10. 4 kg) and 36 males (57. 6 ± 16. 9 years / 177. 4 ± 6. 9 cm / 80. 6 ± 8. 7 kg) visiting at least once a week a fitness mall with access to eccentric and concentric training stations were asked concerning cardiovascular diseases, their corresponding risk factors and their own experience with eccentric muscle training. Differences in the perception of eccentric muscle training compared to concentric training were reported by 18 women and 24 men, however reported Rates of perceived Exertion measured by BORG-Scale (6 - 20) did not significantly differ. A positive Bias that especially persons with cardiovascular illnesses respectively risk factors preferred this kind of activity was not detectable and knowledge of positive aspects of eccentric training was sparse. General practitioners are encouraged to inform patients of the existence of positive aspects of eccentric muscle training and to motivate patients to absolve their training respectively...|$|R
50|$|In 1898, the Sabi Game Reserve was proclaimed by the South African Republic. The reserve covered {{an area of}} 1,210,000 morgen {{equivalent}} to 10364 km2. Before any effective management could take over, the South African War broke out the following year. After the occupation of the Transvaal by British forces, Captain H. F. Francis was appointed as the first Warden of the Sabi Game Reserve in 1901. However, {{he was killed in}} action a month later, at the end of July 1901. A former prospector, W. M. Walker, was then appointed as the second Warden on 24 October 1901. He was dismissed at the end of January 1902 after proving to be a dismal failure in the post. Finally, the new British administration appointed James Stevenson-Hamilton as Warden of the reserve in July 1902.To assist him in his duties, the new Warden started appointing the first game rangers. Each one was given the responsibility of a section of the reserve. Captain E. G. (Gaza) Gray and Rupert Atmore only lasted for a few months and they were replaced with Harry Wolhuter (August 1902) and Thomas Duke (December 1902). They were stationed, respectively, at Pretoriuskop and Lower Sabie. In May 1903 Cecil Richard de Laporte was appointed to the Kaapmuiden post. Shingwedzi Game Reserve, now in northern Kruger National Park, was proclaimed in May 1903. Apart from Stevenson-Hamilton's duties as Warden of the Sabi Game Reserve, this new reserve's administration was also added to his responsibilities. He visited and explored the Shingwedzi Reserve for the first time during September and October 1903. He appointed Major A. A. Fraser as the first ranger for this new reserve in 1904. The <b>eccentric</b> Fraser was <b>stationed</b> at the Malunzane rangers post, not far from the present Mopani rest camp.|$|R
