25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic nihilism in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin shock therapy and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Ellen Gibbels (University of Cologne) had {{attributed}} the limb trembling in Hitler’s late years to Parkinson's disease, a widely held {{consensus in the}} research community. However, some researchers interpreted Hitler’s tremor as a symptom of advanced syphilis, most recently the American historian Deborah Hayden. Hayden links the <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> from which Hitler in her opinion suffered since 1942, to the mental decline {{in the last years}} of his life, especially to his [...] "paranoid temper tantrums." [...] The physician Frederick Redlich however reported that there is no evidence that suggests that Hitler had syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the number of}} {{patients}} residing in mental hospitals increased significantly while {{little in the way of}} effective medical treatment was available. Lobotomy was one of a series of radical and invasive physical therapies developed in Europe at this time that signaled a break with a psychiatric culture of therapeutic nihilism that had prevailed since the late nineteenth-century. The new [...] "heroic" [...] physical therapies devised during this experimental era, including malarial therapy for <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane (1917), deep sleep therapy (1920), insulin shock therapy (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938), helped to imbue the then therapeutically moribund and demoralised psychiatric profession with a renewed sense of optimism in the curability of insanity and the potency of their craft. The success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risk they posed to patients, also helped to accommodate psychiatrists to ever more drastic forms of medical intervention, including lobotomy.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Sisters" [...] {{has been}} a subject of {{scholarly}} debate, mostly {{in regards to the}} priest's illness. One analysis of Father Flynn's illness throughout the second version of the story shows that Joyce deliberately implied that Father Flynn had central nervous system syphilis. Joyce was interested and qualified enough in medicine to be able to describe a syphilitic and had definite reasons for doing so. The syphilitic nature of Father Flynn's illness is apparent in the author's use of paralysis, which was often used synonymously with <b>paresis</b> (<b>general</b> paralysis of the insane) when Joyce began his revisions in 1905.|$|R
2500|$|Nor was Moniz {{the only}} medical {{practitioner}} in the 1930s to have contemplated procedures directly targeting the frontal lobes. Although ultimately discounting brain surgery as carrying too much risk, physicians and neurologists such as William Mayo, Thierry de Martel, Richard Brickner, and Leo Davidoff had, prior to 1935, entertained the proposition. Inspired by Julius Wagner-Jauregg's development of malarial therapy {{for the treatment}} of <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane, the French physician Maurice Ducosté reported in 1932 that he had injected 5ml of malarial blood directly into the frontal lobes of over 100 paretic patients through holes drilled into the skull. He claimed that the injected paretics showed signs of [...] "uncontestable mental and physical amelioration" [...] and that the results for psychotic patients undergoing the procedure was also [...] "encouraging". The experimental injection of fever inducing malarial blood into the frontal lobes was also replicated during the 1930s in the work of Ettore Mariotti and M. Sciutti in Italy and Ferdière Coulloudon in France. In Switzerland, almost simultaneously with the commencement of Moniz's leucotomy programme, the neurosurgeon François Ody had removed the entire right frontal lobe of a catatonic schizophrenic patient. In Romania, Ody's procedure was adopted by Dimitri Bagdasar and Constantinesco working out of the Central Hospital in Bucharest. Ody, who delayed publishing his own results for several years, later rebuked Moniz for claiming to have cured patients through leucotomy without waiting to determine {{if there had been a}} [...] "lasting remission".|$|E
50|$|In 1917 Julius Wagner-Jauregg {{discovered}} that infecting paretic patients with malaria could halt {{the progression of}} <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b> He won a Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1927. After World War II the use of penicillin to treat syphilis made <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> a rarity: even patients manifesting early symptoms of actual <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> were capable of full recovery with a course of penicillin. The disorder is now virtually unknown outside third-world countries, and even there the epidemiology is substantially reduced.|$|E

50|$|Neurosyphilis {{refers to}} an {{infection}} involving the central nervous system. It may occur early, being either asymptomatic or {{in the form of}} syphilitic meningitis, or late as meningovascular syphilis, <b>general</b> <b>paresis,</b> or tabes dorsalis, which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower extremities. Late neurosyphilis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection. Meningovascular syphilis typically presents with apathy and seizure, and <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> with dementia and tabes dorsalis.

50|$|While {{retrospective}} {{studies have}} found earlier instances of {{what may have been}} the same disorder, the first clearly identified examples of paresis among the insane were described in Paris after the Napoleonic Wars. <b>General</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane was first described as a distinct disease in 1822 by Antoine Laurent Jesse Bayle. <b>General</b> <b>paresis</b> most often struck people (men far more frequently than women) between 20 and 40 years of age. By 1877, for example, the superintendent of an asylum for men in New York reported that in his institution this disorder accounted for more than 12% of admissions and more than 2% of deaths.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is remembered}} {{for a work}} on {{insanity}} called [...] "De la folie, considérée sous le point de vue pathologique, philosophique, historique et judiciaire". It {{was one of the}} first publications dedicated to the history of psychiatry, and was a rational discourse that dealt with topics such as demonology, lycanthropy, religious obsession and other abnormal thought processes. The book covered psychiatric issues from the 15th to the 19th century, and is still read today. Another important work by Calmeil was an 1826 treatise that discussed <b>general</b> <b>paresis,</b> considered to be the first separately identifiable neuropsychiatric disease entity. <b>General</b> <b>paresis</b> was originally described a few years earlier by Antoine Laurent Bayle (1799-1858).|$|E
50|$|His {{collaboration}} with neuropathologist Ernst Sträussler (1872-1959) in the Psychiatric Clinic headed by Julius Wagner-Jauregg (1857-1940) lead to several histopathological publications {{related to the}} malaria therapy of dementia paralytica or <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane, a complication of tertiary syphilis.|$|E
50|$|He {{proceeded}} to Düsseldorf, where he temporarily {{worked at the}} Altes Theater with Karl Leberecht Immermann. Grabbe returned to Detmold in 1836 as a broken man, his wife filed for divorce. He died from <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> in the same year.|$|E
50|$|Meyer {{performed}} important {{research on}} the inflammatory nature of brain changes in <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b> Also, he is credited for introducing the standard modern concept of prognathism. In 1867, with Wilhelm Griesinger (1817-1868), he founded the Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten.|$|E
50|$|A {{progressive}} {{state of}} simple dementia results often {{in cases of}} adolescent onset Juvenile <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b> Paresis is being caused by placental-foetal transfer of infection and results in intellectual (mental) subnormality.

50|$|Sträussler {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} in {{forensic}} psychiatry, as well as his research involving the histopathology of the central nervous system. With neurologist Georg Koskinas (1885-1975) he performed important studies involving malaria inoculations as a type of therapy for progressive <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} after the Taylor murder, Peavey left Los Angeles and moved to San Francisco. In 1930, he was {{admitted}} to the Napa State Hospital with <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> due to an untreated case of syphilis. He died there of tertiary syphilis on December 27, 1931.|$|E
50|$|Plaut {{is remembered}} for his {{research}} on the syphilitic origin of <b>general</b> <b>paresis,</b> {{as well as his}} work with August von Wassermann (1866-1925) {{in the development of a}} serological test for syphilis. Plaut performed extensive research of syphilis and its correlation to psychiatric disorders, and conducted early studies in neuroimmunology involving the brain's immune reaction to syphilitic infiltration.|$|E
5000|$|In 1885 he {{provided}} {{a description of}} the dorso-lateral tract, a bundle of fibers between the apex of the posterior horn and the surface of the spinal marrow, that was to become known as [...] "Lissauer's tract". Another eponymous term associated with Lissauer is [...] "Lissauer's paralysis", a condition that is an apoplectic type of <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>General</b> <b>paresis,</b> {{also known}} as general {{paralysis}} of the insane or paralytic dementia, is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder, classified as an organic mental disorder and caused by the chronic meningoencephalitis that leads to cerebral atrophy in late-stage syphilis. Degenerative changes are associated primarily with the frontal and temporal lobar cortex. The disease affects approximately 7% of infected individuals. It prevails among men.|$|E
5000|$|In 1822 Bayle was {{the first}} {{physician}} to provide a comprehensive description of <b>general</b> <b>paresis,</b> which is {{sometimes referred to as}} paralytic dementia, general paralysis of the insane, or [...] "maladie de Bayle" [...] in medical literature. In 1824 he founded the journal Revue médicale, and from 1828 to 1837 was publisher of the multi-volume Bibliothèque de thérapeutique (Library of Therapeutics).|$|E
50|$|Antoine Laurent Jessé Bayle, a French {{physician}} who practiced at Charenton, researched using postmortem evidence which concluded in 1822 that <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane, or GPI, resulted from chronic inflammation {{of a brain}} area. This challenged the established belief {{at the time that}} the mental and physical symptoms, such as paralysis, were present before the inflammation, not as a result of a larger disease.|$|E
50|$|They also {{investigated}} the used of tryparsamide {{as a possible}} treatment for syphilis. Although it was generally much less powerful against spirochetes than against trypanosomes, tryparsamide's ability to pass the blood-brain barrier and enter {{the central nervous system}} made it a useful treatment for syphilis of the brain and spinal cord and the chronic form, <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b> Tryparsamide was a standard treatment for syphilis until penicillin replaced it in 1950.|$|E
50|$|Roses proceeder as Head of Department at Robert-Koch-Institut was Claus Schilling. Rose {{continued}} the Malaria-experiments of Schilling, mostly with psychiatry patients. Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg succeeded in 1917, to gain success with malaria against <b>General</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane. This malaria therapy {{was also used}} by Rose for Schizophrenia. The experiments {{were made in the}} concentrations camps in Dachau and Buchenwald and with mentally ill Russian prisoners in a psychiatric clinic in Thuringia.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the cause}} was {{believed}} to be an inherent weakness of character or constitution. While Esmarch and Jessen had asserted as early as 1857 that syphilis caused <b>general</b> <b>paresis,</b> progress toward the general acceptance by the medical community of this idea was only accomplished later by the eminent 19th Century syphilographer Alfred Fournier (1832-1914). In 1913 all doubt about the syphilitic nature of paresis was finally eliminated when Hideyo Noguchi and J. W. Moore demonstrated the syphilitic spirochaetes in the brains of paretics.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, since 1935, metrazol, an {{epileptogenic}} drug, and insulin, a hormone, were in wide use in {{many countries}} to treat schizophrenics, with great success. This approach was based on Nobel winner Julius Wagner-Jauregg's research {{on the use of}} malaria-induced convulsions to treat some nervous and mental disorders, such as the <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> of the insane, caused by neural syphilis, as well as on Ladislas J. Meduna's theory that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic. The pharmacological convulsive treatment of Ladislas J. Meduna would eventually be largely replaced by the less cumbersome electrical method of Cerletti.|$|E

50|$|Early in his career, he {{published}} a much needed atlas on the pathological histology {{of the nervous}} system with the bacteriologist Victor Babeş and the French pathologist Paul Oscar Blocq. His description with Blocq, of a case of Parkinsonian tremor due to tumour in the substantia nigra in 1893, was the basis for Édouard Brissaud's theory that Parkinsonism occurs as a consequence of damage to the substantia nigra. With Paul Blocq {{he was the first to}} describe senile plaques and with Romanian neurologist Ion Minea confirmed in 1913 Hideyo Noguchi's discovery of Treponema pallidum in the brain in patients with <b>general</b> <b>paresis.</b> His monumental work La Cellule Nerveuse, with a preface by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, appeared in 1909.|$|E
50|$|The {{early part}} of Dr. Delgado’s career was marked by an {{enthusiastic}} adherence to Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic principles and included a frequent correspondence with the founder of psychoanalysis that extended until the late 1930s, long after Dr. Delgado had distanced himself ideologically from Freud. By the mid-1930s, Dr. Delgado had developed a major interest in phenomenology. He also systematically pioneered biological innovations {{in the treatment of}} psychiatric disorders. For instance, he introduced the use of sodium nucleinate in the management of psychotic agitation in 1917 and the use of phenobarbital for the control of seizures in 1919. He was also the first in Latin America to apply malaria therapy in the treatment of <b>general</b> <b>paresis</b> and the use of chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia. In 1957, {{he was one of the}} co-founders of the prestigious Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum in Zurich.|$|E
