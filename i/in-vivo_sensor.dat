40|$|Autonomic {{management}} {{is aimed at}} adapting to uncertainty. Hence, it is devised as m-connected k-dominating set problem, resembled by dominator and dominate, such that dominators are resilient up to m- 1 uncertainty among them and dominate are resilient up to k- 1 uncertainty {{on their way to}} dominators. Therefore, an evolutionary algorithm GENESIS is proposed, which resolves uncertainty by evolving population of solutions, while considering uncertain constraints as sub-problems, started by initial populations by a greedy algorithm AVIDO. Theoretical analysis first justifies original problem as NP-hard problem. Eventually, the absence of polynomial time approximation scheme necessitates justification of original problem as multiobjective optimization problem. Furthermore, approximation to Pareto front is verified to be decomposed into scalar optimization sub-problems, which lays out the theoretical foundation for decomposition based evolutionary solution. Finally, case-study, feasibility analysis and exemplary implication are presented for evolvable autonomic management in combined cancer treatment with <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensor</b> networks.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the thermal rise and Quality-of-Service (QoS) {{provisioning}} issue for an intra-body Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) having <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. We propose a thermal-aware QoS routing protocol, called TLQoS, that facilitates {{the system in}} achieving desired QoS in terms of delay and reliability for diverse traffic types, as well as avoids the formation of highly heated nodes known as hotspot(s), and keeps the temperature rise along the network to an acceptable level. TLQoS exploits modular architecture wherein different modules perform integrated operations in providing multiple QoS service with lower temperature rise. To address the challenges of highly dynamic wireless environment inside the human body. TLQoS implements potential-based localized routing that requires only local neighborhood information. TLQoS avoids routing loop formation as well as reduces the number of hop traversal exploiting hybrid potential, and tuning a configurable parameter. We perform extensive simulations of TLQoS, and {{the results show that}} TLQoS has significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E

Keeping this in mind, we propose FAtigue MEasurement (FAME) protocol for soccer players and soldiers using <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensors</b> for Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs). In FAME, we introduce a composite parameter for fatigue measurement by setting a threshold level for each sensor. Whenever, any sensed data exceeds its threshold level, the players or soldiers are declared {{to be in a}} state of fatigue. Moreover, we use a vibration pad for the relaxation of fatigued muscles, and then utilize the vibrational energy by means of vibration detection circuit to recharge the <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensors.</b> The induction circuit achieves about 68 % link efficiency. Simulation results show better performance of the proposed FAME protocol, in the chosen scenarios, as compared to an existing Wireless Soccer Team Monitoring (WSTM) protocol in terms of the selected metrics.

In this study we have refined and developed a method of NO synthesis, using the neutral Griess reagent, which is inexpensive, simple to perform, and provides a reliable method of generating NO gas for <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensor</b> calibration. The concentration of the generated NO stock solution was determined using UV–visible spectroscopy to be 0. 28 ± 0. 01 mmol L− 1.

However, this is not sufficient to cause any considerable increase in oxidation current when the NO stock solution is used for electrochemical sensor calibration over physiologically relevant concentrations; the NO sensitivity of bare Pt-disk electrodes operating at + 900 mV (vs. SCE) was 1. 08 nA μmol− 1 L, while that for NO 2 − was 5. 9 × 10 − 3 nA μmol− 1 L.

There then follows {{a review of}} techniques for pressure measurement and for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). A catheter containing seven optical fibre pressure transducers {{for use in the}} diagnosis of OSAS is described which has been designed, modelled, built and successfully tested both in the laboratory and on six subjects. The transducer has a range of +/- 5 kPa, a resolution of 10 Pa and a potential bandwidth of > 1 kHz. Oral and nasal breathing, snoring, peristalsis and airway collapse were distinguished using the system. After a review of angioplasty techniques and subsequent healing or arterial restenosis (AR), another optical fibre sensor is described which was designed and built for monitoring the healing of the endothelium and for the detection of AR following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The sensor used a fluorescent antibody antigen reaction and its potential was successfully demonstrated both in-vitro and using mammalian models. The resolution was better than 107 p Moles of antibody. It was shown that the use of a similar radio-labelled reaction was not feasible for in-vivo use.

Attenuation changes induced in the sensor fiber by nuclear radiation are measured using the wave length-time multiplex method. Disturbing influences during the measurement (insufficient end-do-end neutrality, shunt admittance, fading effects) are compensated by the optoelectronic/microelectronic measuring technique in connection with the software aided data evaluation.

40|$|Having a chip {{with a large}} {{array of}} sensitive, fast and linearly responsive, and stable {{recording}} sites is a holy grail of biological sensors for the recording of extracellular potentials from electrogenic cells, especially neurons. Such kinds of chips have been and still being fabricated and used. But these chips are mostly based on silicon and silicon technology. The main drawback of these devices is their inflexibility and high Young’s modulus. Therefore, such devices are unusable if one wants to go into flexible <b>in-vivo</b> <b>sensors.</b> Graphene, considering its overall properties [1], {{seems to be the}} cornerstone for bringing high tech of microelectronics into flexible shell and into biology. The graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) show great performance in terms of response time (<µs) and linearity (∆VGS into ∆IDS). At the same time, the devices show comprehensively high sensitivity (transconductance over 11 mS/V) and overall stability. In this work we generally compare GFETs fabricated on rigid (silicon and sapphire) and flexible (polyimide) substrates. The devices show truly different performance: silicon shows the worst sensitivity, while sapphire and polyimide have comparably similar great performance, although polyimide is a flexible substrate. We can record extracellular signals with the rigid substrate graphene FETs (Fig. 1) and even calculate their propagation through the chip (Fig. 2). We can even record the “reaction” of the cellular layer on special drugs and chemicals: addition of 20 μL of NorA into the cell culture medium doubles their beating frequency, while addition of a surfactant (SDS) results in a slow dissolving of the cellular layer and therefore disappearance of the beating (Fig. 2 c). But is this a huge step forward? This had been done years ago with silicon FETs [2] and multi electrode arrays (MEAs) [3]. In order to go further we have fabricated similar GFETs on flexible polyimide (PI) substrate (Fig. 3 a). These devices, while difficult to perform the usual in-vitro tests, due to bonding problems, are easily implemented for in-vivo measurements. As an intermediate stage we performed the recording of the actual heart tissue slice with such chip (Fig. 3 b) and got very large signal-to-noise (SNR) recorded action potentials (Fig. 3 c) ...|$|R
40|$|The main aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to develop and}} characterise monomer {{modified}} oxygen (O 2) sensors that could withstand the harsh setting of an in-vivo environment, without the risk of alteration of the sensor components and the characterisation of nitric oxide (NO) sensors in-vitro, followed by the complete in-vivo characterisation under physiological conditions. The main result sought after for development of these novel O 2 sensors, was the potential utilisation in a clinical setting. Chapter 1 introduces the background behind the monitoring of NO and O 2 in the brain, the biosynthesis of NO in the brain, the biosynthesis of NO through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) and the potential role of NO in neurovascular coupling. Chapter 2 discusses the theory behind the project and Chapter 3 describes the experimental protocols utilised throughout this research. Chapter 4 discusses the development and characterisation of the monomer modified O 2 sensors. The subsequent characterisation of the novel O 2 <b>sensors</b> <b>in-vivo</b> is discussed in Chapter 5. The use of various perturbations to alter the O 2 concentration for characterisation of the O 2 sensors is described. The characterisation of the NO sensor types (Type 2 and Type 3 NO sensor) is discussed in Chapter 6, with response times, sensitivity and selectivity discussed in detail. The subsequent characterisation of these <b>sensors</b> <b>in-vivo</b> is described in Chapter 7. Systemic and local administrations of various inducers and inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis were carried out to determine the sensors viability in monitoring the analyte in a physiological environment. In Chapter 8, another aspect of this research involving the simultaneous recording of the NO and O 2 analytes in-vivo is described, which utilises {{a combination of the}} styrene modified carbon paste electrodes (SMCPEs) and methyl methacrylate modified carbon paste electrodes (MMCPEs) for the detection of O 2 and the Type 2 and Type 3 sensors for the detection of NO. These results yield valuable information about the possible relationship between the two molecules.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} results are {{presented}} and discussed on the formation, characterisation, optimisation and performance of a polypyrrole-sulfonated β-cyclodextrin (PPy-SCD) film {{that can be used}} as novel dopamine (DA) sensor. This material exhibited a higher sensitivity to DA in comparison to the several other polypyrrole modified electrodes that were investigated in this study and it was also highly selective towards DA {{in the presence of a}} wide variety of major interfering compounds. The sulfonated β-cyclodextrins were immobilised in a polypyrrole film via a potentiostatic mode of growth from an aqueous solution of pyrrole and sulfonated β-cyclodextrin. No supporting electrolyte was used to ensure that the polymer was only doped by the anionic sulfonated β-cyclodextrin. The DA was detected at this material in a sulfate supporting electrolyte, giving peak oxidation and reduction currents at approximately 0. 450 V vs. SCE and 0. 320 V vs. SCE, respectively, for a 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol dm- 3 DA solution. However, similar DA oxidation currents and potentials were obtained in a chloride supporting electrolyte solution. This increases the potential of the PPy-SCD film as a possible <b>in-vivo</b> DA <b>sensor</b> seeing as most biological samples have a high saline content. The oxidation of DA at the PPy-SCD modified electrode was optimised by varying a range of factors and conditions. Using these optimised parameters a limit of detection of 3. 36 x 10 - 6 mol dm- 3 was evaluated using constant potential amperometry. An attempt to increase this sensitivity further by incorporating ultrathin fibers into the polymer matrix proved to be unsuccessful. It was determined that a 1 : 1 inclusion complex was formed between the DA and the sulfonated β-cyclodextrin, whereby the hydrophobic moiety of the DA was included in the cavity. Complex formation constants of 199. 54 ± 4. 88 mol- 1 dm 3 and 240. 18 ± 5. 87 mol- 1 dm 3 were obtained, respectively, from cyclic voltammetry and rotation disk voltammetry in solution. In fact, this complexation in conjunction with oxidation at the polypyrrole film is responsible for the significant DA signal observed at the PPy-SCD modified electrode. A wide variety of interfering compounds were also examined to establish their effect, if any, on the determination of DA at the PPy-SCD modified electrode. The interference from several major interfering compounds, such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, could be effectively blocked. No interference was exhibited from 5 -hydroxytryptamine and 5 - hydroxyindole acetic acid at low concentrations of DA and the oxidation peaks of DA and acetaminophen were effectively separated with the acetaminophen having no influence on the oxidation peak current or potential of the DA signal. However, the interference from epinephrine, homovanillic acid and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid could not be eliminated...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{vegetation}} {{is considered}} a barrier to soil moisture retrieval by both passive and active remote sensing missions. Microwave emission and backscattering of vegetation {{is driven by the}} vegetation dielectric constant, which is a function of vegetation water content. The latter is a measure of root zone water availability. Understanding the variation in dielectric properties of vegetation will contribute to soil moisture retrieval using microwaves in vegetated areas. This study presents a unique dataset of the diurnal pattern of the leaf dielectric properties, which was linked to vegetation water content and water stress. Using a microstrip line <b>sensor,</b> <b>in-vivo</b> dielectric property measurements were conducted on three maize leaves (leaf 8, 10 and 12) from 8 to 19 October 2012. A correlation was found between the resonant frequency of the microstrip line and the leaf water content of maize. This showed that a decrease of leaf water content during the day led to an increase of the resonant frequency. Water stress was quantified by calculating the evaporation deficit and by measuring the soil water tension at 30 cm and 50 cm depth. It was found that the diurnal difference in resonant frequency of the sensor at leaf 8 increased in similar fashion as the soil tension and evaporation deficit, which indicates a correlation between water stress and vegetation dielectric properties. The upper leaves 10 and 12 responded differently to increased water stress. The diurnal difference in resonant frequency of the sensor at leaf 10 and 12 decreased or was non-existent. The dielectric measurements revealed the complex reaction of vegetation to water stress and pointed out many opportunities for further research. The water-cloud model was used to demonstrate the impact of changing water content at different frequencies and polarizations. For L-,C-,X-,Ku- and Ka-band the sensitivity of radar backscatter to soil moisture and vegetation water content was modeled. This showed that at L-band, for low volumetric soil moisture (< 0. 2) vegetation is the main contributor to total backscatter. At higher frequencies backscatter was mainly sensitive to leaf water content. Time series analysis of modeled radar backscatter, based on field measurements of vegetation water content and soil moisture, showed that using the standard water-cloud model, the simulated diurnal difference in backscatter was small (0. 05 dB). A modified water-cloud model was formulated that takes into account leaf and stalk water content separately. This model simulated a higher diurnal difference in backscatter (0. 8 dB) and corresponded better to the trend in decreasing leaf water content and increasing water stress. This study presented interesting results that will hopefully stimulate follow up research projects. As a first step, it already revealed possibilities of using vegetation as an indicator for soil moisture, vegetation water status and water stress. The eventual possibilities of monitoring this at a global scale will lead to new innovative applications that will contribute to improving the state of the world.
