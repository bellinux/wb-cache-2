5|$|In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, {{the author}} claims that Allingham planned to leave <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} intending to leave <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|An anti-mutant {{politician}} {{who wishes to}} ban mutant children from schools using a Mutant Registration Act.

5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy enough for the weight of <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E

5|$|I {{talked with}} one soldier who lay {{shivering}} in a bunk {{in the hospital}} coach. He had no visible sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade. He wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I helped move <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the other coach.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus {{will not be}} disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> {{get in the way}} of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E

5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Coggins was a {{signature}} member and Master Pastelist of the Pastel Society of America, a Fellow of the American Society of Marine Artists, {{a member of}} the American Ordnance Association, the U.S. Naval Institute, and an adviser to the boards of the Philadelphia Maritime Museum and the Reading Public Museum. He died at his home in Berks County, Pennsylvania at the age of 94 and willed <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> medical science. Alma Wood-Coggins died March 4, 2007. Jack and Alma Coggins had no children and were survived by several nieces and nephews.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> explain the second window breaking.|$|E

5|$|Sobieski's mother {{returned}} <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> his home, and {{to commemorate}} him she founded the Church of the Assumption of Mary in Żółkiew, {{which was built}} between 1653 and 1655. Sobieski was buried there in 1655 {{on the day the}} church was consecrated. His brother, King John III Sobieski, commissioned a gravestone by Andreas Schlüter made from black marble, which was destroyed after 1945. In 1946 Sobieski's body was taken to the Dominican's Church in Kraków.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, {{and it took a}} half-hour for <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are indications that he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and even put Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to this spot as well. In 1875, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed, {{and she had no}} kin to claim her remains. William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E
5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in <b>his</b> <b>body.</b> <b>To</b> help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, {{instead of having to}} have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.|$|E
5|$|Lionel is {{sentenced to}} prison for his parents' murder in season four. Lionel {{attempts}} to switch bodies with Lex using a stone from Clark's homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches bodies with Clark instead. When he and Clark switch back, Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed. Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague (Jane Seymour), and begins searching for three stones of knowledge. During this quest, Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge. Lionel recovers from his catatonic state in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor-El takes over <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> speak with Clark. With Jor-El guiding him, Lionel begins helping Clark by making excuses for Clark's behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six. Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society called Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as the Traveler (Clark). When the secret is uncovered, Lex murders his father, realizing he has been covering up the Traveler's existence.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{engaged the}} enemy {{immediately}} after landing with the assault waves. He exposed himself to enemy fire {{in an attempt}} to throw a hand grenade into a pillbox whose fire was pinning down that sector of the beach. He was wounded by enemy gun fire and dropped the grenade. Unable to grasp the hand grenade firmly enough to hurl it, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than endanger the lives of his men. He cradled the grenade under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life. Obregon was killed in action while using <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> shield a wounded fellow Marine.|$|E
