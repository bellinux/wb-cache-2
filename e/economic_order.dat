5|$|With {{states from}} Africa and Asia joining the United Nations, {{development}} issues became increasingly important, {{resulting in the}} expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on an International <b>Economic</b> <b>Order</b> (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by financial crisis and the retreat of the United States, which triggered a reform of the budgetary process and the downsizing of the Organization. With the end of the Cold War, the rediscovery of and renaissance of the United Nations were hailed; {{the first half of the}} 1990s saw a major expansion of the Organization and the reform associated with the Agenda for Peace launched by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the crisis between 1290 and 1348 and the {{subsequent}} epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy. In the decades after the disaster, {{the economic and social}} issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Although the revolt was suppressed, it undermined many of the vestiges of the feudal <b>economic</b> <b>order,</b> and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms, frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry. The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century; growth at this time came from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing. The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region, but generally London, the South and the West prospered {{at the expense of the}} Eastern and the older cities. The role of merchants and trade became increasingly seen as important to the country, and usury gradually became more widely accepted, with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding recent {{paradigmatic}} {{shifts from}} regulation {{as a state}} function to governance as an emergent property of interorganizational networks, conceptions of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> in socio-legal studies remain rather short-sighted. In part, this theoretical myopia stems from a tendency to conceive of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> {{in terms of a}} normative project cast at a macro level of analysis and rooted in the activities of formal institutions and state bodies. What has been overlooked in these accounts is the role played by professional groups in the enactment and legitimation of localized modes of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering.</b> This article seeks to remedy this oversight through an analysis of one particular form of professional labour that has emerged as a key factor in the arbitration of economic disputes and the management of corporate disorder: the forensic accounting and corporate investigation (FACI) industry. By defining this industry in terms of a market in professional services and then exploring the contri-butions of this market to the production of ‘private legal orders’, this analysis sets the stage for a more sophisticated view of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> in capitalist market econ-omies, one which is rooted in the knowledge work of professionals labouring on the margins of law, politics, and business.

Also, the products are to be distributed to customers through local warehouses. In this case, the purpose is to minimize the producers’ overall costs that are results of order costs, distribution costs, and related inventory shipment costs to central and local warehouses. Dada (1992) has analyzed the two-echelon system for spare parts. This system allows a rapid dispatch at the time of inventory shortage.|$|R

The organisation grew from the view that existing institutions like GATT (now replaced by the World Trade Organization, WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries.

25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E

50|$|Economic {{liberalism}} is {{most often}} associated with support for free markets and private ownership of capital assets. It contrasts with protectionism because of its support for free trade and open markets. Historically, economic liberalism arose in response to mercantilism and feudalism.

25|$|While {{the onset}} of the Cold War helped spur {{interconnectedness}} between Canada and Latin America the erosion of Soviet power in the late 1980s gave way to an even more robust partnership. By 1985 the Soviet empire was becoming increasingly bankrupt and unable to promote socialist ideology abroad. For many leftist Latin American states this generated a significant void in support for their vast nationalist/leftist movements. Thus, from the altering world balance came the proliferation of peace talks, the emergence of new economic regimes, and increasingly intertwined relations between the Northern and the Southern Western hemisphere. Canada’s policies towards the region revolved around this new <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> that saw the distribution of power slipping from a bipolar system to multiple states, organizations, and corporations.|$|E
25|$|The U.S held {{strength}} in the Asian region from aggravating European imperialist encroachment. To Japan, this represented a developing threat to {{the autonomy of the}} region. U.S.-Japanese relations would recover a bit in the early 20th century, but by the early 1920s, few in Japan believed that the United States meant anything positive for the future of Asia. By the 1930s, the U.S. presence in Asian affairs, along with the instability in China and the collapse of the Western <b>economic</b> <b>order,</b> Japan would act aggressively with respect to China, setting the precedent that would ultimately culminate in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{development}} {{emerged in the}} 1940s and 1950s out of the post-World War II context in which a new international <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> was established, the United States made contributions to European reconstruction, and attention to the post-colonial Third World increased. The United States included among its aims in World War I the defense of democracies, and after WWII attempted to institutionalize democratic systems in countries that had lost the war (such as Germany and Japan); meanwhile during the Cold War, democracy promotion was a distant goal, with security concerns and a centering of policy against Soviet expansion dominating. President Jimmy Carter applied limited diplomatic pressure, {{which resulted in a}} conservative backlash resistant to criticism of authoritarian allies, while President Reagan selectively supported anti-communist democratic transition in countries such as El Salvador, the Philippines, and South Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing on {{concepts}} of institutional variance and path dependence, varieties of capitalism theorists (such as Peter Hall and David Soskice) identify two dominant modes of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> {{in the developed}} capitalist countries, [...] "coordinated market economies" [...] such as Germany and Japan, and an Anglo-American [...] "liberal market economies". However, such approaches imply that the Anglo-American liberal market economies, in fact, operate in a matter close to the abstract notion of [...] "the market". While Anglo-American countries have seen increasing introduction of neo-liberal forms of <b>economic</b> <b>ordering,</b> this has not led to simple convergence, but rather a variety of hybrid institutional orderings. Rather, {{a variety of new}} markets have emerged, such as for carbon trading or rights to pollute. In some cases, such as emerging markets for water, different forms of privatization of different aspects of previously state run infrastructure have created hybrid private-public formations and graded degrees of commodification, commercialization, and privatization.|$|R
40|$|Building on {{economic}} and social exchange theories, this study develops an integrated model in which curtailing opportunism in international joint ventures (IJVs) requires four interrelated sets of suppressing forces: (1) contractual ordering (contractual inclusiveness and contractual obligatoriness); (2) structural ordering (managerial governance and equity captiveness); (3) relational ordering (interparty attachment and boundary-spanner ties); and (4) justice ordering (procedural justice and distributive justice). Using a sample of 192 IJVs in an emerging market, this study finds general support for our theoretical model. Our research validates that countering opportunism involves a system-wide effort that integrates {{economic and social}} mandates, unifies ex ante and ex post mechanisms, controls both egoistic and non-egoistic motivations, and combines organizational-level and individual-level forces. For partners from individualist cultures, <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> forces (contractual and structural) are stronger than social ordering forces (relational and justice) in relation to opportunism resistance, whereas for partners from a collectivistic culture, social ordering forces are relatively stronger than <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> forces for this end.

30|$|In this paper, EPQ {{models for}} non-instantaneous deteriorating items in which holding cost is an {{increasing}} function of the ordering run length are developed. The classical EPQ model is extended by considering a relationship between holding cost and the ordering cycle length. In practical real-life situations, most of the goods would have a period of maintaining quality or preserving original condition, during which (e.g., electronic goods, blood banks, fresh fruits, and so on) no deterioration occurs. Since deterioration does not occur, {{it is assumed that}} holding cost is constant. However, when deterioration starts, extra effort and more capital investment in storehouse equipment is needed to overcome it, therefore, here, it is considered that holding cost is increasing as function of the ordering cycle length. The <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> cycle length and the <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> quantity are obtained. Two models are developed that consider the cases of with and without shortages in which shortage occurs and in the other one it does not happen. Optimal solutions are derived and convexity of the cost functions is established. Besides, numerical examples are given to test and verify the theoretical results.|$|R

He served secretary of the committee Mansholt, a committee of these three parties on the implications of the Limits to Growth-report for the Netherlands. He was re-elected in 1972. In 1973 he became Minister of Development Cooperation in the cabinet Den Uyl. He changed the development cooperation-policy of the Netherlands, giving it a political goal: the equal distribution of power and wealth in the world. The development cooperation policy became oriented towards the New International <b>Economic</b> <b>Order,</b> in which developing countries would become self-reliant. In 1975 1,5% of the domestic product was spent on development aid. His proposal to include communist states as Cuba and North Yemen as recipient countries of Dutch development aid, led to some controversy, but he put his proposal through. His policy supported liberation movement in Southern Africa. His leftwing policy put him at odds with the more moderate PvdA Minister of Foreign Affairs Max van der Stoel. As Minister for Development Cooperation, Pronk held several prominent positions in international organizations: between 1973 and 1977 he was Deputy Governor of the World Bank. Because of his many international travels, he often fell asleep at Cabinet meetings, which lasted until very late in the night.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} a theoretical model of opportunism in inter-organizational exchanges in emerging markets. I decompose opportunism into 'strong form' (contractual norm violation) and 'weak form' (relational norm violation), {{and suggest that}} strong form {{tends to be more}} observable, measurable and remediable than weak form and its adverse effect on cooperation tends to be stronger but less enduring than weak form. I address how external uncertainty, a multidimensional concept that includes market volatility, legal unprotectability, information unverifiability and regulatory variability, along with internal uncertainty that reflects dyadic tensions such as goal disparity, resource misfit, cultural dissimilarity and bargaining asymmetry, together affect exchange members' opportunism. This is followed by further discussions on conditions under which firms will opt for strong form or weak form opportunism {{in the face of such}} external and internal uncertainties. I suggest that suppressing forces against opportunism necessitates not only <b>economic</b> <b>ordering,</b> such as contractual mechanisms and structural mechanisms, but also social ordering, such as relational mechanisms and justice mechanisms. I expect that <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> is more effective in resisting strong form opportunism while social ordering is more forceful in curtailing weak form opportunism. ...|$|R
