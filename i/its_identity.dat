5|$|On September17, a new {{hurricane}} {{was identified}} {{just off the}} southern coast of Mexico with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Moving northwestward, the storm eventually made landfall near Acapulco, Mexico at this intensity. Shortly after moving over land, the storm lost <b>its</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> the following day {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Eline {{was unusual}} in its track after {{striking}} Madagascar. Most storms in the Mozambique Channel {{turn to the}} south, ultimately missing land; however, upon landfall, Eline became one of 5% of recorded cyclones to strike southern Africa. In addition, favorable conditions allowed the storm to maintain <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> over land. Overall, Cyclone LeonEline traveled over 11,000km (6,800mi) during its 29day duration.|$|E

5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). By the next day, Florence lost <b>its</b> <b>identity,</b> while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Doria quickly intensified as its wind field expanded while moving northward. The minimum central pressure quickly dropped, as well, and late on August 27, Doria {{reached its peak}} intensity of 65mph (105km/h) while making landfall on North Carolina near Morehead City. The storm maintained its peak winds as it moved north-northeastward through North Carolina, and weakened slightly to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm after entering Virginia on August 28. Doria turned to the northeast, passing through the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva Peninsula before entering southern New Jersey. It paralleled the state a short distance inland, and after moving through New York City Doria became extratropical over northwestern Maine on August 29. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward until losing <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> near the border of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{turned to}} the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in {{response}} to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained 3.6 °F (2 °C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120mph (195km/h) major hurricane on August 5 while located 450miles (710km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters late on the 5th while 290miles (465km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950miles (1530km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E

5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> near Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Late on 10April, {{the center}} of Olivia passed near Barrow Island at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed near Varanus Island as a {{high-end}} Category4 or low-end Category5 cyclone. Within several hours of passing by Varanus Island, Olivia made landfall near Mardie at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken overland. Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern Australia. It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> as a gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E

5|$|Late on 20May, the JTWC ceased {{advisories}} on {{the system}} as it weakened below tropical depression status offshore. However, the Bureau of Meteorology continued to monitor the system. Early on 21May, the center of Herbie made landfall in Shark Bay with wind gusts up to 120km/h (75mph) and a pressure of 980hPa (mbar). Due to the rapid movement of the storm, it reached the Great Australian Bight while retaining tropical characteristics despite its low-latitude. Early on 22May, the system lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> south of Australia as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{its peak}} {{intensity}} {{for over a}} day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September15. At this point, there is uncertainty as {{to the structure of}} Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September19.|$|E
5|$|On November21, 1960, the {{formation}} of a small low-pressure area was noted following a shift in surface winds on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Slowly developing, the low organized into a tropical depression by 1200UTC, the 24th of the season. At this time, it was situated 270km (165mi) southwest of Enewetak Atoll. Though classified a depression, maximum sustained winds were only estimated at 35km/h (25mph). For unknown reasons, the system soon became diffuse and abruptly shifted direction to the east-southeast. Concurrently the cyclone lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> as a tropical cyclone and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discontinued advisories on it by 0600UTC on November24. The remnant disturbance subsequently doubled back to the west, bypassing the islands of Pohnpei and Chuuk before re-intensifying.|$|E

5|$|Recurving to the northeast, Faye {{continued}} weakening due {{to strong}} wind shear, with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring {{on the afternoon}} of August27. The remnants of the typhoon initially continued moving east-northeast before stalling that evening. Faye began to reorganize, and was estimated to have re-attained typical storm strength on August28. Faye intensified slightly, nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August29, but this trend was short-lived due to increased wind shear. By August31, a building ridge to Faye's north led to a southwest motion as the system steadily weakened. However, Faye managed to maintain <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> as a weak tropical cyclone for several days, before finally dissipating on September3.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} Hurricane Six lost <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> over Mexico, a new {{tropical}} storm formed near {{the southern edge}} of the Gulf of California on September20. Some forecasters stated that the system may have been the remnants of the preceding storm which regenerated. However, the Hurricane Database did not confirm this. The system tracked nearly due north, attaining maximum winds of 50mph (85km/h), nearing the coastline of Mexico several times. However, the storm did not make landfall during its existence. On September22, it turned westward before dissipating just off the coast of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was {{regarded}} as the most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} on 27March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing <b>its</b> <b>identity</b> the following day.|$|E
