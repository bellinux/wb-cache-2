40|$|The {{ability to}} write a {{successful}} conference abstract {{seems to be one}} barrier preventing new researchers from <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> work in their particular disciplinary community.

The findings from the open-ended questions and the move analysis of 137 abstracts indicated that there was a mismatch between these potential conference abstract writers ’ knowledge and the actual composition of these conference abstracts. Besides the rhetorical structures of conference abstracts, this paper also provided some pedagogical suggestions on dealing with this mismatch.

Higher Education Quarterly, DOI: 10. 1111 /hequ. 12088, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. This paper takes a cross-disciplinary perspective in examining the views and practices of public engagement with research by UK academics. Using a mixed method approach consisting of a survey questionnaire and interviews, the paper identifies the range of audience groups that can potentially be engaged with by academics, and shows that some audiences are more relevant to particular disciplinary groups than others. The paper also identifies the various public engagement activities undertaken by academics and finds that some academics are using creative ways of engaging the public, such as using the services of public relations firms to help in <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>research</b> in traditional media outlets, and also by using social media. Essentially, the study reveals that some academics feel the pressure of engaging particular audiences at the expense of those that are relevant to them and that, academics in the main, are opposed to the notion of mandating public engagement as part of appraisal systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cross-cultural and {{international}} research are important components {{of public health}} research, but the challenges of language barriers and working with interpreters are often overlooked, {{particularly in the case}} of qualitative research. Methods A case-study approach was used to explore experiences of working with an interpreter in Bangladesh as part of a research project investigating women's experiences of emergency obstetric care. The case study Data from the researcher's field notes provided evidence of experiences in working with an interpreter and show how the model of interviewing was adapted over time to give a more active role to the interpreter. The advantages of a more active role were increased rapport and "flow" in interviews. The disadvantages included reduced control from the researcher's perspective. Some tensions between the researcher and interpreter remained hard to overcome, irrespective of the model used. Independent transcription and translation of the interviews also raised questions around accuracy in translation. Conclusion The issues examined in this case study have broader implications for public health research. Further work is needed in three areas: 1) developing effective relationships with interpreters; 2) the impact of the interpreter on the research process; and 3) the accuracy of the translation and level of analysis needed in any specific public health research. Finally, this paper highlights the importance to authors of reflecting on the potential impact of translation and interpretation on the research process when <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>research.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis study {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} whether investigators from less wealthy countries {{were at a}} disadvantage in <b>disseminating</b> <b>their</b> <b>research,</b> after accounting for potential differences in research quality and infrastructure. Methods and ResultsIn this bibliometric analysis a representative random selection of 10 % (n= 1002 studies) of all abstracts submitted to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) congress 2006 was followed for publication and citation from September 2006 to December 2011. The main variable of interest was the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the country of the principal investigator. Using multivariable models that adjusted for socioeconomic indicators and previously identified markers of research quality, we {{examined the relationship between}} per-capita GDP and three study endpoints: Acceptance at the ESC congress, full-text publication, and number of two-year citations. Among 1002 abstracts from 63 countries, per-capita GDP was positively correlated with all three study endpoints. After adjusting for markers of research quality and infrastructure, per-capita GDP remained a strong predictor for acceptance at the ESC congress (adjusted OR for every 10, 000 USD increase in per-capita GDP, 1. 44; 95 % CI, 1. 15 to 1. 80), full-text publication within 5 years (adjusted OR, 1. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 17 to 1. 90), and high citation frequency (adjusted OR, 2. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 31 to 4. 04). These findings were largely consistent in a subgroup of abstracts of high-quality, prospective clinical trials. ConclusionInvestigators in less wealthy countries face challenges to disseminate their research, even after accounting for potential differences in the quality of their work and research infrastructure...|$|E
