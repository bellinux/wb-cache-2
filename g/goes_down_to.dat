5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E
5|$|The Rockaway-bound {{platform}} has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile {{leading to}} a short staircase that <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the intersection of 159th Road and 103rd Street. The Brooklyn-bound platform has a set of emergency doors leading {{to the parking lot}} just north of the AirTrain JFK station; they are normally locked, but were in use from December 2012 to May 2013 as a connection to a temporary shuttle bus service instituted after Hurricane Sandy. Both platforms have stairs, escalators, and an elevator to the headhouse above the platforms.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> West Road by {{the intersection of}} Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a short call from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E
25|$|This station complex {{has many}} entrances/exits from the streets. The {{one at the}} north end of Columbus Circle leads to the Trump International Hotel and Tower. It has a double wide {{staircase}} going down to an intermediate level before another double-wide staircase <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> fare control, where a now unused token booth and turnstile bank lead to the IND mezzanine as well as the north end of the northbound IRT platform. There is also one elevator from the back of the staircase that <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> fare control.|$|E

25|$|The {{maritime}} pine (Pinus pinaster) is found at an intermediate altitude and on generally siliceous soil, which in Galicia <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> sea level and inland alternates with Pyrenean oak. Over limestone, the black pine (Pinus nigra subsp salzmannii) {{plays an important}} role in many of the mountain ranges in the centre, east and south of the Peninsula; in limy soil, and at the same altitude, it usually displaces the former. Both are displaced at higher altitudes by the Scots pine.|$|E

When Anderson heads to Gifford's office, Gifford sneaks into his apartment, and steals a gun, knowing that Anderson keeps a gun collection. He then quickly <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Blanche's apartment, where he murders the young woman, after forcing her to write a note explaining she was romantically involved with Anderson, and implicating him in her murder.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 45.4% of the {{population}} were at risk of poverty before social transfers, compared to the EU27 average (Croatia not yet included) of 44.1%. When pensions are included the percentage <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 25.2%. 17.5% of {{the population}} were at risk of poverty after social transfers, meaning their disposable income was below their national at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60% of the national median income per adult equivalent. This is just above the European Union average of 17%, and compares favorably to other Southern European countries, such as Spain (22.2%), Italy (19.4%) and Greece (23.1%).|$|E

25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
25|$|This {{station has}} an {{elevated}} station house beneath the tracks {{at the extreme}} south end. A single staircase from each platform <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Near these staircases, one elevator leads from each platform to the mezzanine. Outside fare control, there is a token booth; an elevator and two staircases {{go down to the}} northwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, while two escalators within an enclosed passageway lead directly to the complex's underground mezzanine area (via a new transfer passageway), and the northbound platform's elevator (within fare control) also leads to the underground mezzanine, bypassing the street along the way. A single staircase also leads to the southwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street, and is signposted as serving only the Flushing Line station (as opposed to all three stations of the complex).|$|E
25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it in ships; {{to and fro}} {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; {{so that when he}} comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|E

25|$|Like the two differing genealogies, the infancy {{narratives}} appear only in Matthew and Luke {{and take}} {{different approaches to}} reconciling the requirement that the Messiah be born in Bethlehem with the tradition that Jesus in fact came from Nazareth. In Matthew, Joseph obeys the direction of an angel to marry Mary. Following the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, Joseph and family stay in Bethlehem for an unspecified period (perhaps two years) until after the visit of the Three Magi, when Joseph is told by an angel in a dream to take the family to Egypt to escape the massacre {{of the children of}} Bethlehem planned by Herod, the ruler of the Roman province of Judea. Once Herod has died, an angel tells Joseph to return, but to avoid Herod's son he takes his wife and the child to Nazareth in Galilee and settles there. Thus in Matthew, the infant Jesus, like Moses, is in peril from a cruel king, like Moses he has a (fore)father named Joseph who <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Egypt, like the Old Testament Joseph this Joseph has a father named Jacob, and both Josephs receive important dreams foretelling their future.|$|E

[...] After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs' dog and only companion, Hugo, and steals Scuggs's money. [...] He corners her in an alley, where the tenants spot him and call the police, accusing him of trying to molest a minor. [...] Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him, he shoots himself, embracing Hugo's body.|$|E

Just {{three days before}} his trial with Cardiff was set to begin Ray Clemence, the Barnet manager, offered Primus a two-year contract with the club. It was later revealed that Clemence was told by his assistant, Terry Harvey, that he should sign him immediately: [...] "Get in now and sign him, if he <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Cardiff and sees their stadium he will sign for them." [...] Primus was determined to prove Charlton wrong and says he [...] "grew from a boy to a man" [...] at Barnet. This was also a time when depression was common for Primus, and he became addicted to alcohol and drugs such as ecstasy and LSD.|$|E
