40|$|<b>External</b> quality <b>audits</b> are {{now being}} used in {{universities}} across the world to improve quality assurance, accountability for quality education and transparency of public funding of higher education. Some countries such as Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark have had <b>external</b> quality <b>audits</b> {{for more than a}} decade but there has been limited research as to their impact. This study analyses the extent to which <b>external</b> <b>audits</b> in Australia have improved quality assurance in universities over the past 10 years. The analysis is based on discussions with 40 participants in a workshop on the effectiveness of audits and the review of 60 <b>external</b> quality <b>audit</b> reports between 2001 and December 2010. The research found that while <b>external</b> <b>audits</b> have led to an improvement in systems and processes in Australian universities, they have not necessarily improved the student experience. This lack of impact on the student experience in Australia is similar to other countries, according to the literature review.

The article analyses the views of 120 respondents including senior members of the universities and some AUQA auditors and evaluates university satisfaction with the <b>external</b> quality <b>audit</b> process. The study finds that the audit process used by AUQA in Australia is satisfactory due to its enhancement-led reviews. The findings indicate that <b>external</b> quality <b>audits</b> alone cannot be credited for improving quality assurance in universities. A combination of <b>external</b> quality <b>audits</b> together with the internal and external operating environment has significantly contributed to improving quality assurance in universities.

A cycle of <b>external</b> <b>audits</b> carried out every 5  years is recommended. To carry this out, the guidelines recommend the development of special auditing organisations. These should preferably be non-profit organisations, if possible, supported by professional and/or scientific societies. These auditing organisations should be accredited by a national accreditation body. International audit services may be exploited where no national systems exist. Auditors would require a suitable professional background and would comprise a multidisciplinary team, which could include radiologists, radiographers and medical physicists.

Companies are sought to be held accountable regardless of their approval. It is in this sense that <b>external</b> <b>audits</b> part with attempts to establish social accounting as an intrinsic feature of organisational behaviour. The reports of Social Audit Ltd in the 1970s on e.g. Tube Investments, Avon Rubber and Coalite and Chemical, laid the foundations for much of the later work on social audits.|$|R
40|$|The auditor and the insitutionalization of distrust: the professionalization of <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden This paper {{addresses}} professionalization with a {{focus on}} trust, rather than on issues of power and competition. It contains a conceptual analysis of trust/confidence, as well as a case study of the professionalization of <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden. The conceptual analysis discusses the “time-binding” aspect of trust/confidence, and the significance of social control mechanisms related to “persons”, “roles”, “values” and “programs” for creating and sustaining trust/confidence. The case study focuses on the role of trust/confidence for the organization and professionalization of <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden, and in particular on the ways in which trust in auditors and auditing have been stabilized. The latter issue is dealt with through a discussion attempting to capture a historic displacement in three dimensions: from reliance on the auditor’spersonal reliability, to trust in the professional role; from trust in the individual discretion of certain persons to trust in the regulation of auditing as a standardized program; and finally, from trust in the values represented by individual auditors to trust in the institutionalized professional values.

Auditing activity is known as an activity which brings plus value, an activity with a short history, borned from our need of a high level of performance regarding all the activities developed in a company, especially in now-a-days economy when the word quality gains a much higher value.
