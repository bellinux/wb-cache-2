5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly <b>erosive,</b> resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains. Soil {{types in the}} San Juan watershed {{can be divided into}} the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the <b>erosive</b> ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious <b>erosive</b> threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most <b>erosive</b> force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages <b>erosive</b> processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the <b>erosive</b> ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little <b>erosive</b> effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an <b>erosive</b> effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the <b>erosive</b> properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather {{plays a major role in}} erosion of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of <b>erosive</b> acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bedrock}} has {{frequent}} fractures on the surface, glacial erosion rates tend {{to increase as}} plucking is the main <b>erosive</b> force on the surface; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion {{tends to be the}} dominant <b>erosive</b> form and glacial erosion rates become slow.|$|E
25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} nodal osteoarthritis and <b>erosive</b> osteoarthritis (EOA, {{also called}} inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA {{is a much}} less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular <b>erosive</b> changes on x-ray.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, <b>erosive</b> esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis.|$|E
25|$|Ice and frost’s <b>erosive</b> {{activity}} and the periglacial environment {{on the surface of}} Kolata massif have led to solifluction, reaching the eluvian stratum.|$|E
25|$|The flows were {{strongly}} <b>erosive,</b> extracting rocks and {{material from the}} bedrock, even {{far away from the}} vent. Noticeable erosion occurred in the areas over which pyroclastic flows had passed, forming abrasion surfaces and removing loose detritus from the ground.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers {{in lower}} latitudes {{tend to be}} much more <b>erosive</b> than glaciers in higher latitudes, because they have more meltwater {{reaching}} the glacial base and facilitate sediment production and transport under the same moving speed and amount of ice.|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of esomeprazole are {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{treatment and}} maintenance of <b>erosive</b> esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of soda pops are acidic as are many fruits, sauces and other foods. Drinking acidic drinks {{over a long period}} and {{continuous}} sipping may erode the tooth enamel. A 2007 study determined that some flavored sparkling waters are as <b>erosive</b> or more so than orange juice.|$|E
25|$|Both {{macroscopic}} (from endoscopy) and microscopic positive {{findings are}} required to make a diagnosis. Barrett's esophagus is marked {{by the presence of}} columnar epithelia in the lower esophagus, replacing the normal squamous cell epitheliuman example of metaplasia. The secretory columnar epithelium may be more able to withstand the <b>erosive</b> action of the gastric secretions; however, this metaplasia confers an increased risk of adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{infrequent}} heartburn may take either antacids or H2-receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2-antagonists offer several advantages over antacids, including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for antacids), greater efficacy, and ability to be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of heartburn occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for <b>erosive</b> esophagitis since they {{have been shown to}} promote healing better than H2-antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{is from a}} source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and <b>erosive</b> disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Wave swash and {{currents}} can impact significantly on {{the sediment}} budget, {{although it is}} difficult to measure. Swash can be either an <b>erosive</b> or accretion process depending on many factors such as the sand texture and the individual wave itself. Although during fair weather the impact of swash is negligible, during storms the sea level can rise high enough to erode dunes and cliffs, dumping large quantities of sediment into the littoral cell, which can only be given back to the dune by aeolian transport. Where storm surge causes sediments to be deposited on the land from the littoral cell, they can form washover fans or open a new tidal inlet which transports sediment away from the littoral cell.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic of {{the country}} are the {{enormous}} fissures which divide it, formed over time by the <b>erosive</b> action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as ambas, with nearly perpendicular sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} <b>erosive</b> {{effects of}} acid reflux (an extremely common condition, {{also known as}} gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked {{to this type of}} cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, maybe due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett's esophagus is unclear, and may in the past have been overestimated.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Lake Superior basin reflects the <b>erosive</b> power of continental glaciers that advanced and retreated over Minnesota {{several times in the}} past 2 million years. Lake Superior was shaped by the geology of the Midcontinent Rift. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the loosely cemented sandstone that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the igneous rocks forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. In the final retreat of the ice from the Lake Superior basin about 11,000 years ago, meltwaters filled the rift's scoured-out sandy core. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of {{the highest levels of the}} ancient Lake Superior, Glacial Lake Duluth.|$|E
25|$|Copeland Creek and {{its tributaries}} drain this property; moreover, all of these streams rise on Sonoma Mountain and {{eventually}} discharge to the Laguna de Santa Rosa, which discharges to the Russian River. The Copeland Creek watershed is the southernmost drainage in the Russian River drainage basin. All creeks south of Copeland, beginning with Lichau Creek, {{are part of the}} San Francisco Bay watershed. Precipitation within the Copeland Creek watershed is considered moderate within the state of California; in fact, the maximum intensity for an historic one-hour rainfall is classified as below average (at about 1.90inches (48millimeters) per hour). Since many of these upper reaches of Copeland Creek involve steep slopes, often above 50percent, the momentum of streamflow in winter months is high. Even though soils in the watershed are moderately <b>erosive,</b> the extensive basaltic armoring of Copeland Creek minimizes sedimentation and produces an outcome of stream waters lacking in significant turbidity.|$|E
25|$|Chemosynthetic {{communities}} thrive where cold fluids seep {{out of the}} forearc. Cold seep {{communities have}} been discovered in inner trench slopes down to depths of 7000 m in the western Pacific, especially around Japan, in the Eastern Pacific along North, Central and South America coasts from the Aleutian to the Peru–Chile trenches, on the Barbados prism, in the Mediterranean, and in the Indian Ocean along the Makran and Sunda convergent margins. These communities receive much less attention than the chemosynthetic communities associated with hydrothermal vents. Chemosynthetic communities are located {{in a variety of}} geological settings: above over-pressured sediments in accretionary prisms where fluids are expelled through mud volcanoes or ridges (Barbados, Nankai and Cascadia); along active <b>erosive</b> margins with faults; and along escarpments caused by debris slides (Japan trench, Peruvian margin). Surface seeps may be linked to massive hydrate deposits and destabilization (e.g. Cascadia margin). High concentrations of methane and sulfide in the fluids escaping from the seafloor are the principal energy sources for chemosynthesis.|$|E

500|$|Along {{the length}} of the Dead Sea Transform (also known as the Levantine fault) there are several {{pull-apart}} basins that have resulted {{in the formation of the}} Dead Sea as well as the Gulf of Aqaba. The [...] gulf comprises three distinct pull-apart basins that were formed by individual segments of the fault and are known as (from north to south) the Elat Deep, Aragonese Deep, and the Dakar Deep. At [...] wide, the gulf is relatively narrow, but is up to [...] deep, with the nearby mountains near [...] in height. This difference in elevation suggests that the tectonic activity outpaces the <b>erosive</b> processes in the area, but the background seismicity is infrequent and is marked by earthquake swarms.|$|E
500|$|Wetter climates brought upon by ice ages {{starting}} 2million {{years ago}} greatly increased excavation of the Grand Canyon, which {{was nearly as}} deep as it is now, 1.2million years ago. [...] Volcanic activity deposited lava over the area 1.8million to 500,000 years ago. At least 13 lava dams blocked the Colorado River, forming lakes that were up to [...] deep. The {{end of the last}} ice age and subsequent human activity has greatly reduced the ability of the Colorado River to excavate the canyon. Dams in particular have upset patterns of sediment transport and deposition. Controlled floods from Glen Canyon Dam upstream have been conducted to see if they have a restorative effect. Earthquakes and mass wasting <b>erosive</b> events still affect the region.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} World War I, the gun used about [...] of RP C/12 (Rohr-Pulver– tube powder) {{propellant}} {{that was a}} mix of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2975 [...] kelvins. In World War II, it was replaced by RP C/38 that substituted diethylene glucol dinitrite for the nitroglycerine which had a calorific value of 810 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2495 K. This had the virtue of being harder to ignite, lessening {{the risk of a}} catastrophic fire or explosion, and reduced the <b>erosive</b> effects of the gaseous propellant on the gun's bore. Sources differ on the amount of RP C/38 used by the gun during World War II; Campbell says , but Hogg says [...]|$|E
500|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels. The limestones contain fossils of crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods, providing evidence of the abundant marine life {{that existed in the}} shallow tropical seas that covered these areas at that time. Some hills, such as in the Mendips, are in excess of [...] above sea level, and from them flow rivers of substantial <b>erosive</b> power. Examples of erosion may be seen at Cheddar Gorge and the caves within it, where the soft limestone has been scoured into gorges and caverns of great depth and length. At the end of the Permian (299–252 million years ago) and Triassic periods (252–201 million years ago), the Variscan orogeny resulted in the uprising of several mountainous areas including Dartmoor to the south, Exmoor, the Quantocks and the Mendips.|$|E
500|$|The {{cutting of}} Santa Ana Canyon across the Peninsular Ranges is {{attributed}} to the wetter Southern California climate during the Wisconsinian Glaciation and earlier ice ages, during which rivers in Southern California were substantially bigger in volume. The Santa Ana River, which existed prior {{to the creation of}} the Peninsular Ranges, maintained its course as an antecedent stream due to its increased <b>erosive</b> power. The canyon was eroded through bedrock that today divides the groundwater basins of the Inland Empire and the coastal plain. Because groundwater in the watershed generally flows from east to west, it is forced to the surface at the bedrock [...] "sill" [...] of Santa Ana Canyon, resulting in a perennial stream that prior to development flowed freely across the coastal plain to the Pacific. During this period, the Santa Ana changed course multiple times, eroding now-dry wind gaps in the Peninsular Range and the coastal mesas around Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.|$|E
500|$|During {{the last}} glacial period (110,000 to 10,000 years ago), {{especially}} in the Wisconsinian glaciation (31,000 to 10,000 years ago), the climate of Southern California changed radically from arid to wet, to a climate likely similar to the present-day Pacific Northwest. Prodigious rainfall gradually turned the small streams of the region into large and powerful rivers. It was this surge in volume that allowed Aliso Creek and other rivers {{to cut through the}} San Joaquin Hills. A [...] drop in sea level escalated the process, allowing the rivers to flow more rapidly and have more <b>erosive</b> power. As sea levels rose after the Wisconsinian glaciation, the water gaps the rivers had cut through the San Joaquin Hills, including Aliso Canyon, became fjord-like inlets. Aliso Creek and these other streams deposited sediments into the inlets, turning them into flat-floored alluvial valleys with an elevation very close to sea level. Eventually, the sediment deposited met the coastline. By then, the rivers and streams had diminished to their original flow before the glaciation.|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of the town are several caves of the Mendip Hills, {{including}} Thrupe Lane Swallet which is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and the St. Dunstan's Well Catchment which is an important cave system including a series of spectacularly-decorated caves which in total extend to about [...] of mapped passage. The caves at Fairy Cave Quarry were formed mainly by the <b>erosive</b> action of water flowing beneath the water-table at considerable pressure (so called 'phreatic' development), but as the water table has fallen many of the caves now lie well above it and the system now contains a variety of cave formations (stalagmites, stalactites and calcite curtains) which in their extent and preservation are amongst the best in Britain. Shatter Cave and Withyhill Cave are generally considered to be amongst the finest decorated caves in Britain in terms of their sheer abundance of pure white and translucent calcite deposits. Small numbers of greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (R. hipposideros) and Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) hibernate in the cave system. An area of nationally rare species-rich unimproved calcareous grassland of the Sheep's-fescue-Meadow Oat-grass type occurs in the field to the east of Stoke Lane Quarry.|$|E
500|$|The hot, {{dry climate}} makes it {{difficult}} for soil to form. Mass wasting, the down-slope movement of loose rock, is therefore the dominant <b>erosive</b> force in mountainous area, resulting in [...] "skeletonized" [...] ranges (mountains with very little soil on them). Sand dunes in the park, while famous, are not nearly as widespread as their fame or the dryness of the area may suggest. The Mesquite Flat dune field is the most easily accessible from the paved road just east of Stovepipe Wells in the north-central part of the valley and is primarily made of quartz sand. Another dune field is just [...] to the north but is instead mostly composed of travertine sand. The highest dunes in the park, and some of the highest in North America, are located in the Eureka Valley about [...] to the north of Stovepipe Wells, while the Panamint Valley dunes and the Saline Valley dunes are located west and northwest of the town, respectively. The Ibex dune field is near the seldom-visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost part of the park, just south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. All of the latter four dune fields are accessible only via unpaved roads. Prevailing winds in the winter come from the north, and prevailing winds in the summer come from the south. Thus the overall position of the dune fields remains more or less fixed.|$|E
