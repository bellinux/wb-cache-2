25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (or at any rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{a halt to the}} deal. Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E
25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them all here before taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an isolated area, the player might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down a platform by casting a gust of wind, climb onto the platform, and then return the platform to its original position and jump off. The player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's touch pad. Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
