We consider herein three intramolecular mechanisms and two radical pathways.

Further improvements are obtained for a two‐step annealing in which a second step at 840 – 850 [*]°C for 15 – 40 s follows the main anneal step.

Electrically active deep‐level traps were studied by sensitive deep‐level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and optical DLTS techniques. A dominant 0. 57 ‐eV electron trap, which is also present in furnace‐annealed GaAs, originates from implantation damage and is possibly related to VGa.

40|$|Ionic Liquids (ILs) {{have drawn}} {{a great deal}} of {{attention}} as carbon capture agents, and in order to understand them studies must be performed probing the CO 2 –IL interaction. Many studies have focused upon measuring the solubility of CO 2 within ILs, with fewer studies directly probing the CO 2 adsorption environments within the IL. Understanding of the adsorption environments is of fundamental for the use of ILs industrially, if they are to be successfully applied within carbon capture and storage devices. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) has been used to study the CO 2 –IL interaction within two ionic liquids; 1 -octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C 8 C 1 Im][BF 4]) and 1 -octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]). Experiments were performed utilising low temperature line of sight mass spectrometry (LTLOS MS), ensuring that only species desorbing from the surface are observed. Surfaces were formed through a coadsorption method, where IL was deposited by chemical vapour deposition at a rate of ≈ 1 layer per minute while CO 2 was simultaneously leaked into the chamber at pressures between 2 × 10 − 8 and 2 × 10 − 6 mbar. This study finds that CO 2 does not form a monolayer on a gold surface at ≈ 90 K, with no CO 2 TPD peak seen for those experiments, showing Edes,CO 2 (the activation energy of desorption of CO 2) < 24. 5 kJ mol− 1. When IL and CO 2 are coadsorbed the IL is seen to stabilise the CO 2, such that a TPD peak for CO 2 is seen, with the amount of stabilisation depending upon the IL used. Comparison of experimental TPD curves with calculated TPD profiles, using CO 2 states with a range of binding energies, shows that there are multiple CO 2 environments within the ILs. The use of TPD allowed the relative populations of these CO 2 adsorption environments to be measured, which is not possible using solubility measurements and Henry’s constants, providing insights into the IL–CO 2 interaction. CO 2 was observed to desorb from sites within the bulk IL, which <b>have</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> desorption in the range 24. 5 to 43 kJ mol− 1. The CO 2 was seen to be stabilised most within the [C 8 C 1 Im][BF 4], giving a stabilisation in Edes of up to 18. 5 kJ mol− 1. The [C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N] was typically seen to stabilise twice as much CO 2 as [C 8 C 1 Im][BF 4], which is consistent with the experimental Henry’s constants. Further to this a new experimental technique for determining surface structure, utilising high energy X-rays in the total reflection regime, to generate an X-ray standing wave (XSW) and detect the resulting photoelectrons from layered surfaces has been demonstrated. The variable period X-ray standing wave (VPXSW) technique relies on the fact that at low incident angles (typically < 2 °) total external reflection of X-rays is observed. The incident and reflected X-rays interact to generate an XSW along the surface normal, with nodes and antinodes at different heights, z, above a reflector for different angles of incidence. By scanning the incident angle of the X-ray from 0 ° upwards the periodicity of the XSW decreases, resulting in the nodes and antinodes sweeping towards the surface. As this sweeping occurs the nodes and antinodes pass through material adsorbed on the surface of the reflector, and the photoelectron signal fluctuates. Comparing the fluctuations in the measured photoelectron signal to a theoretical model allows surface layering to be detected at larger depths and with a higher information content than with other surface science techniques. This allows distance information, relative to the interfaces between different materials, to be obtained for different chemical species. Data is presented from a surface consisting of the ionic liquid [C 8 C 1 Im][BF 4] on a Si(001) reflector, held at ≈ 90 K, with a thick IL layer adsorbed on the reflector and a CHCl 3 marker layer on top of the IL. Results from the frozen surface indicate a 12 Å layer of CHCl 3 and background water had been dosed on top of a 211 Å IL layer. These values agree well with what was expected for this model IL system with a thin marker layer, designed to test the technique. It is therefore shown that VPXSW with photoelectron emission can be used to successfully characterise thin films with thicknesses between 15 Å and ≈ 300 Å with chemical shift specificity, something not possible with current experimental techniques...|$|E

For the same reason, these devices can in turn be used as tools to study carrier dynamics. It is well known that some traps may be saturated by pre-irradiation with ionizing radiation (e. g. β-particles), a process called "pumping" or "priming". Not all traps behave in the same way. Due to the large bandgap of diamond, both shallow (not affected by pumping) and deep traps for electrons and holes may exist.

The second stage was first order and <b>had</b> an <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 40 kJ mol⁻¹. The reduction of WO₃ and WO₃ graphite mixtures with hydrogen were studied from 575 to 975 °C. The reactions were controlled by mass-transfer under the conditions investigated. The addition of carbon increased the rate of the reduction process, but did not affect the phases formed in the system. CO₂ was evolved mainly at the start, and CO mainly {{at the end of the}} process. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{reliability}} evaluation plan carried out on GaN/InGaN blue LEDs, including life tests at RT at three current levels: 20 mA, 50 mA, 100 mA, thermal storage at high ambient temperature (up to 300 °C), and finally high current density (≈ 100 A/cm 2) and high junction temperature (300 °C). Failure modes consist of: (a) an increase in series resistance and/or forward voltage; (b) an increase in the tunneling component of forward diode current, and of reverse current; (c) a substantial degradation of optical intensity. Device degradation is correlated with a remarkable decrease in the apparent doping and with the appearance <b>of</b> deep levels <b>having</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> 0. 55 ± 0. 05 eV and 1. 21 eV, which may act as "dark" centers. Degradation has been interpreted {{as a result of the}} instability of dopant in the p-layer. Breaking of Mg-H complexes, with subsequent formation of Mg-H 2 and Mg-H-N can in fact explain both the active doping decrease (resulting in increased p-layer resistivity, higher forward voltage and series resistance, and increasing current crowding), and the occurrence of deep levels...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the effect of}} the most important parameters, the precipitation temperature, the sodium hydroxide concentration and the initial seed ratio (SR) in the solution, on the boehmite precipitation from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions. A kinetic model that describes the experimental data was developed. According to that model, boehmite precipitation follows second order reaction kinetics and <b>has</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 89 kJ/mol. The orders of the precipitation reaction with respect to the initial sodium hydroxide concentration and the initial seed ratio are estimated to be - 1. 8 and 0. 54, respectively. The most important result is that the boehmite precipitation reaches an apparent equilibrium stage at which the alumina concentration is much higher compared to the value of the boehmite solubility under the same experimental conditions. The results reveal that the boehmite precipitation is a self-decelerated process and the observed kinetic inhibitions are related to the sodium hydroxide concentration in the supersaturated solution. Finally, a mechanistic interpretation of the experimental data is presented based on the concept of the surface precipitation of boehmite on the active sites of the boehmite seed.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to {{investigation}} of cation self-diffusion mechanisms, taking place in UO 2, UO 2 +x, and UO 2 -x crystals simulated under periodic (PBC) and isolated (IBC) boundary conditions using the method of molecular dynamics in the approximation of rigid ions and pair interactions. It is shown that under PBC the cations diffuse via an exchange mechanism (with the formation of Frenkel defects) with <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 15 - 22 eV, while under IBC there is competition between the exchange and vacancy (via Schottky defects) diffusion mechanisms, which give the effective <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 11 - 13 eV near the melting temperature of the simulated UO 2. 00 nanocrystals. Vacancy diffusion with lower <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 6 - 7 eV was dominant in the non-stoichiometric crystals UO 2. 10, UO 2. 15 and UO 1. 85. Observations showed that a cation vacancy is accompanied by different number of anion vacancies depending on the deviation from stoichiometry: no vacancies in UO 2. 15, single vacancy in UO 2. 00 and four vacancies in UO 1. 85. The corresponding law of mass action formulas derived within the Lidiard-Matzke model allowed explaining the obtained <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> and predicting {{a change in the}} <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> within the temperature range of the superionic phase transition. The diffusion of cations on the surface <b>of</b> nanocrystals <b>had</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> 3. 1 - 3. 6 eV. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
