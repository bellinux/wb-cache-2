Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its author, {{was inspired by a}} story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera {{falls in love with a}} family friend, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Wang Zhizhi {{refused to}} return to China {{to play for the}} {{national}} team and was subsequently banned from playing for China, the CBA stipulated that Yao would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> play for the national team. They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission {{on the morning of the}} draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he would rise from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after Easter Sunday, which was accepted reluctantly by his followers. Most believed that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> fulfill a vision that he had regarding future tent meetings.|$|E

5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E
5|$|However, SERN learns of {{the time}} machine and sends a group to {{retrieve}} it, killing Mayuri in the process. Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time numerous times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the time line, Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E

25|$|Transport to {{the island}} is {{provided}} by C-130 Hercules military transport planes operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force that land at Jan Mayensfield's gravel runway. The planes fly in from Bodø Main Air Station eight times a year.

In 1935, Dora decided to look for better housework opportunities in Astorga, León, but the onset of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) caused her to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> her hometown.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} months, Richard's men {{occupied}} and refortified Ascalon, whose fortifications had earlier been razed by Saladin. The spring of 1192 saw continued negotiations and further skirmishing between the opposing forces. The Crusader army made another advance on Jerusalem, coming {{within sight of}} the city before being forced to retreat once again because of dissension amongst its leaders. During this period, Richard began to receive disturbing news of the activities of his brother John and the French king, Philip Augustus. As the spring gave way to summer, it became evident that Richard would soon <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> his own lands to safeguard his interests.|$|E
25|$|Since {{officers}} {{have to be}} on call-out most of the day, they may be assigned to regular patrol duties. To decrease response times to situations that require a SWAT team, it is now a common practice to place SWAT equipment and weaponry in secured lockers in the trunks of specialized police cruisers. Departments that often use this style of organization are county sheriffs, due to the different sizes of counties, and the predominance of back-roads. In places like Los Angeles, where traffic may be heavy, the LAPD use cruisers such as this to respond with their officers so they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> a police station to armor up. However, heavier duty equipment may be needed depending on the situation that arises.|$|E

25|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure. Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Some species of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface. This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect can breathe air from the bubble while submerged. An air bubble provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called passive diffusion, however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the surface.|$|E
