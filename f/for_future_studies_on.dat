We start by identifying the social and cultural values of 50 professionals from the Sevilla, using the Hofstede model, adding some exploratory questions about the event, allowing understanding the perceived impact of the exhibition. We then have analyzed the Expo 92 reality through the case method by using longitudinal information. Results demonstrate how the socio and cultural values of Sevilla inhabitants have influenced the Expo 92 during its realization, but also after the event.

40|$|The paper {{concentrates}} on in situ bending tests {{and analysis of}} the failure of materials exhibiting strong anisotropy. As a typical example, Ti 2 AlC microcantilevers (MCs) were scrutinized. The anisotropic flexural strength of Ti 2 AlC MCs was measured, and the strength of the strong orientation was found to be two and half times as high as that of the weak orientation. The transition of fracture strength and mechanisms could be evaluated. Our findings have generic implications <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the fracture behavior of layered materials. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Biomarkers of {{exposure}} {{are the most}} widely used because they can provide information on the route, pathway, and sometimes, even the source {{of exposure}}. These indicators also allow researchers to work forward in time to determine an exposure, and prevent it from causing further damage. This is unlike biomarkers of effect, in which a scientist may work backwards to determine if and what kind of exposure took place, but may be too late to change anything. However, biomarkers of effect are useful <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> the chemical(s) of interest and the results may aid in stricter laws or guidelines regarding the chemical(s).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine women relationship with other directors and firm performance. Specifically we test for the effect of percentage of women and women relationship on firm accounting performance. The sample uses 263 listed companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia that have women on boards from 2010 to 2012. The results show that women representations on the board do not enhance firm performance. We also find that appointment of women director based on relationship with other board members decreases firm performance. The appointment of women directors on the boards are influence by networking, relationships or family ties. Thus, these findings provide some implications <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> women and firm performance...|$|R

40|$|The great {{debates of}} most fields {{associated}} with economic development rest on emergence versus intention and {{the interplay between}} the two. The “residual” of unexplained divergence between goal and outcome, in this sense, can be ascribed {{in part to the}} interplay, or co-evolution, between policies (intention) and self-organizing (emergent) development. Do public policy and economic development co-evolve in technologically innovative economies, and if so, how? This paper discusses the basic premise that the gap between economic development strategies and their poor implementation cannot simply be removed by creating better-intended strategies, tools or institutions. The analysis uses evolutionary thinking for an analysis of economic development, and ends with some postulates <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> innovative regions and the concept of resilience. ...|$|R

40|$|Spine {{stereotactic}} body {{radiation therapy}} represents an important advancement {{in the management}} of spinal metastases that allows precise delivery of ablative doses of radiation therapy with excellent local control. Although the technique is being increasingly used in clinical practice, the optimal fractionation schedule remains uncertain. In this perspective paper, we review radiobiologic principles that support the use of multiple- versus single-fraction spine stereotactic body radiation therapy schedules and clinical data supporting the multiple-fraction approach. Specifically, we suggest {{that there may be a}} local control benefit of fractionation, while helping to limit the risk of toxicities such as vertebral body fracture, pain flare and radiation myelopathy.

40|$|AbstractA moving-least square mesh-free {{method that}} is based on the first-order shear {{deformation}} theory (FSDT) is introduced to investigate multi-panel plate structures under different loadings and boundary conditions. The structures are regarded as assemblies of flat panels that lie in different planes. The governing equations of the flat panels are given by the moving-least square approximation and the FSDT. A treatment is implemented to modify the equations, and the equations are then superposed to obtain the governing equation of the entire structure. Unlike the finite element methods, no mesh is required in determining the governing equations for the flat panels, which means time-consuming remeshing is entirely avoided <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the large deformation problems of the structures. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, several numerical examples are calculated.

Six categories of sustainability indicators (mobility, safety, socio-economic impact, natural resources, energy and emissions, and cost) and more than thirty sustainability performance measures have been defined as evaluation criteria for the selection of highway corridor improvement options. Currently, MOSAIC considers the no-build case and two highway improvement options, including adding a general-purpose lane and converting at-grade intersections to grade-separated interchanges.
