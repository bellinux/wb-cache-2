5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} {{in an interview with}} TV Guide, in which he said he did [...] "research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [...] it's really appalling." [...] Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and [...] "he will be sorry he ever made it." [...] Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: [...] " [...] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh." [...] On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: [...] "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We must be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right.</b> I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show—not 60 Minutes. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this." ...|$|E

I was <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> {{because so many people}} get nominated and that's it; but {{to be a part of}} a project that actually won was the moment I realized I was in the right business." [...] Bellinger also told Billboard Magazine that he stayed with Brown in the studio everyday for about two months. Then, RoccStar and PK played the beat and he immediately thought about Michael Jackson. So they said, [...] "Go in the booth and do some Michael-type stuff." [...] In another interview, Bellinger said, [...] "He [...] really, really went back to the days of Sam Cooke, but we were still able to keep it 2013 at the same time." [...] Bellinger also cited Justin Timberlake as another influence for the song and Brown's upcoming album [...] "X".|$|E
2500|$|In education, the {{ethic of}} care speaks of {{obligation}} to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> {{and a sense}} that we must <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> when others address us. The [...] "I must" [...] response is induced in direct encounter in preparation for response. [...] We respond because we want to; either we love and respect those that address us or we have significant regard for them. As a result, the recipients of care must respond in a way that demonstrates their caring has been received.|$|R

50|$|The {{conventional}} {{accounting practice}} {{used to generate}} these figures is disputed however by management thinker Professor John Seddon, who argues that the measurement known as 'unit cost' tells you nothing about overall costs. Overall costs include 'failure demand', which {{is defined as a}} failure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> for the customer.|$|R
6000|$|But when full {{allowance}} {{has been}} made for this harmless element of poetry and pretty human perversity in the thing, I shall not hesitate to maintain here that this cult {{of the future is}} not only a weakness but a cowardice of the age. It is the peculiar evil of this epoch that even its pugnacity is fundamentally frightened; and the Jingo is contemptible not because he is impudent, but because he is timid. The reason why modern armaments do not inflame the imagination like the arms and emblazonments of the Crusades is a reason quite apart from optical ugliness or beauty. Some battleships are as beautiful as the sea; and many Norman nosepieces were as ugly as Norman noses. The atmospheric ugliness that surrounds our scientific war is an emanation from that evil panic which {{is at the heart of}} it. The charge of the Crusades was a charge; it was charging towards God, the wild consolation of the braver. The charge of the modern armaments is not a charge at all. It is a rout, a retreat, a flight from the devil, who will catch the hindmost. It is impossible to imagine a mediaeval knight talking of longer and longer French lances, with precisely the quivering employed about larger and larger German ships The man who called the Blue Water School the [...] "Blue Funk School" [...] uttered a psychological truth which that school itself would scarcely essentially deny. Even the two-power standard, if it be a necessity, is in a sense a degrading necessity. Nothing has more alienated many magnanimous minds from Imperial enterprises than the fact that they are always exhibited as stealthy or sudden defenses against a world of cold rapacity and fear. The Boer War, for instance, was colored not so much by the creed that we were <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right,</b> as by the creed that Boers and Germans were probably doing something wrong; driving us (as it was said) to the sea. Mr. Chamberlain, I think, said that the war was a feather in his cap and so it was: a white feather.|$|E

In the interview on Broadway World, Davis said; [...] "We get hate mail. We get talked about on the hate message boards.

50|$|Failure {{demand is}} a systems concept used in service organisations first {{discovered}} and articulated by Professor John Seddon as 'demand {{caused by a}} failure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> for the customer'. Seddon makes the distinction between 'failure demand' and 'value demand', {{which is what the}} service exists to provide. Failure demand represents a common type of waste found in service organizations.|$|R

5000|$|A more subtle, {{though more}} {{significant}} {{objection to the}} error, as sabermetricians have noted, is more conceptual. In order for a fielder {{to be charged with}} an error, he must have <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> by being in the correct place to be able to attempt the play. A poor fielder may [...] "avoid" [...] many errors simply by being unable to reach batted or thrown balls that a better fielder could successfully reach. Thus, it is possible that a poor fielder will have fewer errors than any fielder with higher expectancies.|$|R
50|$|Blame is {{the act of}} censuring, holding responsible, making {{negative}} {{statements about}} an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise. When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right,</b> we may say {{that his or her}} action is praiseworthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.|$|E
5000|$|A {{certain number}} of the polyamory people have gotten on my case about it. I don't hear from them directly, but I made the huge mistake of reading my Amazon {{customer}} reviews recently, and there was someone there who complained that I'd completely misconstrued the philosophy of polyamory -- so there's that contingent. Then you've got a {{certain number of}} the more traditional Buddhist crowd, who've never even heard of polyamory, who think I take a much too positive view of it. I feel that if I'm somewhere in the middle of those two sets of opinions, I must be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

Michael is called to Corporate to answer the question, [...] "What are you doing right?" [...] After several minutes of Michael's inarticulate babble, his superiors concede that while Michael is definitely <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>right,</b> they will probably never know exactly what.

50|$|So he {{collaborated with}} Sumit Batheja {{and wrote a}} {{completely}} Punjabi version of Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana and pitched it to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Though Mehra liked it, Sharma and Batheja {{felt that there was}} something missing, so they went back to the script and reworked some portions. Once they were satisfied with what they had written, they showed it to Vikramaditya Motwane. He loved it and said that if Anurag Kashyap doesn't produce it, he would. Sameer Sharma was happy that they had <b>done</b> <b>something</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "next" [...] is {{important}}: [...] "Maybe next year" [...] {{as opposed}} to [...] "this year". means, [...] "All right, I've screwed it up this year. Maybe next year I'll <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> in my life." [...] So it's [...] "well, maybe next year" [...] even though it isn't accented in the music. This {{is a place where}} the lyric and the music aren't as apposite as they might be, because the important word is [...] "next", and yet the accented word is [...] "year". That's my fault, but the performer must overcome.|$|R
5000|$|Value Demand is {{the demand}} for service from customers, while Failure Demand is the demand caused by a failure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> for the customer. Failure demand is thus demand that only exists because initial demand was not {{satisfied}} properly. For example, {{a large proportion of}} calls that call centers receive are either chasing down enquiries made earlier, or to correct earlier work that was not done properly. As one of the key aims of [...] "Lean" [...] is to eliminate waste, Failure Demand represents an obvious type of waste in service organizations.|$|R

It's constantly evolving, blurring its already muddled gray area with each passing artist leak.

This happened largely because of another smash composition of Sabater and Jiménez called [...] "Bang Bang".

He argues that shared service projects fail (and often end up costing more than they hoped to save) because they cause a disruption to the service flow by moving the work to a central location, creating waste in handoffs, rework and duplication, lengthening {{the time it takes to}} deliver a service and consequently creating failure demand (demand caused by a failure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>right</b> for a customer).|$|R
