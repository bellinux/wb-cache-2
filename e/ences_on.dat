The most normal technique for dealing with the recommendation mechanism is to use collaborative filtering, in which it is essential to discover the most similar users to whom you desire to make recommendations. The hypothesis of this paper is that the results obtained by applying traditional similarities measures can be improved by taking contextual information, drawn from the entire body of users, and using it to cal- culate the singularity which exists, for each item, in the votes cast by each pair of users that you wish to compare. As such, the greater the measure of singularity result between the votes cast by two given users, the greater the impact this will have on the similarity. The results, tested on the Movielens, Netflix and FilmAffinity databases, corroborate the excellent behaviour of the singularity measure proposed...|$|E

40|$|Fruit biomass and frugivore {{abundance}} were quantified over 3 y in a {{rain forest}} of the south Western Ghats, India. Fruit biomass was estimated by sampling fruit fall in the primary forest, and frugivore abundance by a 2. 5 -km transect. A total of 645 kg ha-' of fruit was produced annually in the forest.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anthelmintic activity of encapsulated Eucalyptus staigeriana essential oil (<b>EncEs)</b> <b>on</b> the eggs and larvae of Haemonchus contortus. Therefore, the egg hatching test (EHT), larval development test (LDT) and worm load evaluation were performed to evaluate Meriones unguiculatus experimentally infected with H. contortus. The chemical constituents of E. staigeriana essential oil (EsEO) and the in vitro oil release profile from the chitosan matrix at a pH of 1. 2 and 7. 0 were also characterized. EncEs and EsEO inhibited larval hatching by 97. 19 % and 99. 96 % at doses of 1. 5 and 1. 0 mgml− 1, respectively. In the LDT, EncEs and EsEO induced a larvicidal effect greater than 95 % at concentrations of 5. 8 and 8 mgml− 1, respectively. EncEs and EsEO decreased H. contortus load in M. unguiculatus by 40. 51 % and 46. 44 %, respectively. The major chemical constituents of EsEO were (+) -Limonene (72. 9 %), 1, 8 -Cineole (9. 5 %) and o-Cimene (4. 6 %). The release profile of EsEO was 30 % in acid and 25 % at neutral pH. The similar efficacy of EncEs and EsEO demonstrates that there was no optimization of anthelmintic action following the encapsulation process. Therefore, the use of new encapsulation matrices with controlled release in the pH of the abomasum should be investigated...|$|E

Gas temperatures of 2000 - 2700 K were determined analyzing IR-water bands. Particle temperatures were estimated to 1200 - 1400 K assuming black body radiation.

40|$|Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) made {{important}} {{contributions to the}} study of atmospheric elec- tricity during a brief but productive period from 1859 – 1861. By 1859 Kelvin had recognised the need for “incessant recording” of atmospheric electrical parameters, and responded by inventing both the water dropper equaliser for measuring the atmospheric potential gradient (PG), and photographic data logging. The water dropper equaliser was widely adopted internationally and is still in use today. Following theoretical consid- erations of electric field distortion by local topography, Kelvin developed a portable electrometer, using it to investigate the PG on the Scottish island of Arran. During these environmental measurements, Kelvin may have unwittingly detected atmospheric PG changes during solar activity in August / September 1859 associated with the “Carrington event”, which is interesting in the context of his later statements that solar magnetic influ- <b>ence</b> <b>on</b> the Earth was impossible.

Women who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier (on average 5 years) gave birth to healthy children more often than women, who received diagnosis later.

The oxygen diffusion coefficient fulfills this requirement and may be better suited as a characteristic parameter to describe the oxygen regime. The measurement of the gas diffusion coefficient is a common method to describe the oxygenation in mineral soils, but this method has not been studied well on growing media yet. In this investigation four different growing media were {{used to measure the}} oxygen diffusion coefficient at two different bulk densities and four different water tensions in the labora tory.

Therefore with higher disturbance in the intertidal zone, higher depend− <b>ence</b> <b>on</b> the species pool from nearby assemblages (e. g. subtidal) should be observed. Here we examine adult community structure to investigate levels of similarity among marine as− semblages of Arctic intertidal zones compared with those in adjacent subtidal areas. Addi− tionally we compare Arctic results with similar data from a temperate area. We selected boulder fields as a model habitat and we predicted that subtidal and intertidal diversity would change differently under varying disturbance regimes. Multivariate analysis of data from Arctic and temperate North Atlantic indicates that in the Arctic, intertidal and subtidal assemblages were more similar to each other than were temperate intertidal and subtidal as− semblages. We suggest this is not because of species differences but that the temperate areas are less disturbed. The wave and ice battered, highly disturbed intertidal assemblages of the Arctic were composed of a subset of nearby subtidal assemblages with similar dominance structure. Intertidal specialist species were {{not found in the}} Arctic samples. In contrast, tem− perate intertidal boulder−field assemblages had a completely different dominance structure to the adjacent subtidal. Furthermore, temperate intertidal assemblages were composed of different (specialist) species often not found in the subtidal zone. We conclude that more disturbed environments, such as our Arctic study sites, are more dependent on outside sources of recruitment...|$|R

In total 53 crossbred calves were tested: 30 from BS dams and 23 from dual purpose (12 from Si and 11 from Re dams). Growth performances were measured, carcases were scored for muscle conformation and fatness, the fifth rib was dissected, and the Longissimus thoracis (LT) was analysed. The maternal breed had significant effects when the calves from dairy cows (BB BS) were compared {{to those of the}} dual pur- pose breeds (BB Si and BB Re), as at slaughter the former were 1. 2 % taller, 6. 0 % less in vivo muscle score, 5. 0 % less carcase muscle score, with a 13 % greater proportion of bone in the rib, and their LT had 12. 5 % less drip losses, but 3 % greater cooking losses and 25 % greater shear force. It was concluded that when using a BB as a sire, the dam breed has influ- <b>ence</b> <b>on</b> the growth performance traits of the derived crossbreds, but the major influence would regard the carcase and meat quality traits. In the Alps, these differences are reflected in different sold prices of the crossbred calves from dairy and dual purpose breeds at local auctions...|$|R
