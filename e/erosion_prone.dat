30|$|In {{order to}} reverse soil erosion, several {{efforts have been}} exerted since the 1970 s (Bekele and Holden 1998; Menale et al. 2009; Nigussie et al. 2012). However, past soil {{conservation}} efforts did not bring significant changes to the ongoing soil degradation problems (Bekele and Holden 1998; Menale et al. 2009). Most recently, watershed management is an approach followed {{by the government of}} Ethiopia to protect soil from erosion in particular and to reverse land degradation in general (Desta et al. 2005; Gete 2006; Nigussie et al. 2012). Although dramatic reduction has been made in arresting soil erosion (AgWater Solutions 2012; Nigussie et al. 2012; Tongul and Hobson 2013), the approach has not been supported with intervention prioritizing techniques that identify highly susceptible areas using geospatial analysis. The Geleda watershed is in the northwestern of the Ethiopian highlands where soil erosion is rampant. Hence, identifying and prioritizing erosion susceptible areas for soil conservation measures are quite essential. There are barely similar efforts in the past approaches to identify and prioritize <b>erosion</b> risk <b>prone</b> areas for intervention. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} analyze erosion risks across the landscape for prioritization of conservation measures in the study watershed. The limitation of this study was the soil loss estimated with the model was not validated, basically due to the absence of measured soil loss data in the studied watershed.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} soil erosion on global carbon cycling, {{especially}} {{as a source}} or sink for greenhouse gases, {{has been the subject}} of intense debate. The controversy arises mostly from the lack of information on the fate of eroded soil organic carbon (SOC) whilst in-transit from the site of erosion to the site of longer-term deposition. Solving this controversy requires an improved understanding of the transport distance of eroded SOC, which is principally related to the settling velocity of sediment fractions that carry the eroded SOC. Although settling velocity has already been included in some erosion models, it is often based on mineral particle size distribution. For aggregated soils, settling velocities are affected by their actual aggregate size rather than by mineral particle size distribution. Aggregate stability is, in turn, strongly influenced by SOC. In order to identify the effect of aggregation of source soil on the transport distance of eroded SOC, and its susceptibility to mineralization after transport and temporary deposition, a rainfall simulation was carried out on a silty loam. Both the eroded sediments and undisturbed soils were fractionated into six different size classes using a settling tube apparatus according to their settling velocities: > 250, 125 to 250, 63 to 125, 32 to 63, 20 to 32 and < 20 μm. Weight, SOC content and instantaneous respiration rates were measured for each of the six class fractions. Our results indicate that (1) 41 % of the eroded SOC was transported with coarse aggregates that would be likely re-deposited down eroding hillslopes, rather than with fine particles likely transferred to water courses; (2) <b>erosion</b> was <b>prone</b> to accelerate the mineralization of eroded SOC, and thus might contribute more CO 2 to the atmosphere than current estimates which often ignore potential effects of aggregation; (3) preferential deposition of SOC-rich coarse aggregates potentially causes an increase of SOC remaining in the colluvial system and a reduction of SOC flux to the alluvial or aquatic system. These findings identify a potential error of overestimating net erosion-induced carbon sink effects, and thus add an additional factor to consider when improving our current understanding of SOC erosion and deposition on hillslopes...|$|R
40|$|Future storm {{impacts on}} dune {{evolution}} due to changing storm frequency were simulated in XBeach at an exemplary dune system, Formby Point, UK. Probabilistic approaches {{were used to}} establish the future storm clusters from 2015 to 2065 in three scenarios, using measured data in Liverpool Bay. Cross-shore profile simulations were carried out in two series: Recovery and Cluster. Recovery used the same initial profile assuming that the profile is fully recovered when the subsequent storm event occurs. Cluster used the modified profile from the previous storm event. Within a single event, the maximum erosion and accretion of the profile occurred under the Recovery conditions due {{to the presence of}} a pronounced nearshore ridge-runnel pattern that evolved during severe storm events. Only a few storm events impacted on the upper dune area resulting in a bed level change, which under the Cluster approach was more noticeable when compared with the Recovery approach. The inter-Tidal area experienced erosion while the sub-Tidal area showed accretion in both the Recovery and the Cluster approaches, and the agreement of bed level change was considerably higher than that in the upper dune area. Vulnerability of the upper dune area increases in the Cluster approach as the initial storm events flatten the nearshore ridge-runnel pattern, and then the severe storm events directly impact on the dune front. High dune elevation at Formby Point prevents lowering of the dune crest due to the storm cluster erosion and therefore it can still withstand against flooding. Spatial modelling of the dune system is required to gain more insights of <b>erosion</b> and flood <b>prone</b> areas along this coast...|$|R

40|$|Pasture {{degradation}} {{process is a}} complex phenomenon: its causes and consequences lead to a gradual decrease in the pasture's carrying capacity and culminate with its degradation. Inadequate pasture management may lead to degradation at its area, and consequently to {{a decrease in the}} amount of biomass available for the cattle. These degraded areas deserve attention, especially if located in high declivity areas, which are subject to processes such as soil <b>erosion</b> and therefore <b>prone</b> to the development of ravines and gullies. These declivity areas can be located using data from several sources, such as topographic maps and digital elevation models. The objective of this work is to determine topography declivity classes at the APTA (São Paulo State Agribusiness Technology Agency) farm, located in the city of Pindamonhangaba, SP, Brazil. The APTA farm was chosen due to its participation in the project "Development of Geotechnologies for Identifying and Monitoring Pasture Degradation Processes ? Geodegrade", whose objective is to develop geotechnologies for the identification and monitoring of pasture degradation levels. The sources used for obtaining altimetry data on the study area were 1 : 10, 000, SRTM, ASTER DTM and TOPODATA data. The data were compiled in a georeferred database, and were used to generate different declivity maps. The maps generated from topographic maps (1 : 10, 000) were the most detailed.

40|$|Quantification of {{soil erosion}} using {{conventional}} approaches is hampered {{by lack of}} extensive spatial coverage and long duration data. Therefore use of these approaches for land management advisory has tended to result in unsatisfactory landuse plans that are in great disparity to on-site observations by farmers. Farmers have great knowledge of {{what they perceive as}} the indicators of soil erosion, which have so far not been empirically linked to actual soil loss or crop yield rates. This study was conducted to attach quantitative values of soil loss and maize crop yields to on-site erosion and sedimentation indicators as perceived by the farmers in the central highlands of Kenya. Soils exhibiting splash pedestals, sheetwash, rills, sedimentation, red colour and stoniness were the erosion indicators selected for quantification. Three soil types and three slope gradients were identified and on each runoff plots were installed to relate the sheet-rill erosion developments to actual soil loss. Whereas the temporal changes of the rills and pedestal height (sheet erosion) were used to quantify erosion rates within nine bounded runoff plots, five erosion indicators were identified within 24 ¿ 31 farmers' fields with an aim of estimating crop yield gaps. Statistical procedures applied included correlation matrix, linear regressions and analysis of variance using Duncan' multiple range tests within the SPSS program. The study observed that the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil surface level and various dimensions of the rills were influenced by slope length and prolonged rainy days. Soil loss correlated significantly with individual rill dimensions except soil surface level. But when soil surface level, rill depth, width and total length were combined, they were all found to be significant variables influencing the actual soil loss. Two models were constructed relating soil loss rates with both the rill sizes and decline in soil surface levels. Also five widespread erosion indicators were empirically linked to specific crop yield levels. Because of soil erosion a crop yield gap of more than 50 % was observed in fields bearing superficial stoniness and sedimentation indicators. On basis of these results rate of soil loss can now be estimated at field scale by fieldworkers in situations where sheet-rill <b>erosion</b> is <b>prone</b> within a rainfall event or season. This would assist in formulating satisfactory and timely advice for the farmers on the effectiveness of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures and also in assessing the rate of soil erosion instead of relying on ill-fitting conventional erosion models. The approach could enable successful planning and implementation of SWC measures whereby priority is given to areas identified with severe erosion indicators. Besides knowing soil loss rates, crop yield decline experienced by farmers could be a useful soil productivity indicator for the on-going soil erosion. Conversely, where progressive evolution of soil erosion indicators corresponded to decline in crop yields then specific indicators could be used to predict crop yields farmers were likely to obtain in a given rainfall season, other land management practices remaining constant...|$|R

5000|$|Māori {{continued}} to experience significant cultural change during this century. In 1900 few Māori lived in urban settlements. It was rare for any Māori {{to live in}} a European settlement. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 Māori in Auckland in 1935. By 1936 only 11.2% of Māori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment-from working on hapu-based rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning Māori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population. During the 1930s and 1940s MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help Māori make better use of their remaining tribal land. Māori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much Māori land was steep, remote, <b>erosion</b> <b>prone</b> with high rainfall. [...] European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanized to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. Māori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans.

Māori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.|$|E

Soil erosion would have impact on fertility of agricultural land and quality of water. The major objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the spatial heterogeneity of annual soil erosion on the grid-cell basis in a small agricultural watershed of eastern India. The study watershed has a drainage area of 973  ha and is subdivided into three sub-watersheds namely: KGSW 1, KGSW 2 and KGSW 3, based on the land topography and drainage network. Average annual soil erosion was estimated on 100  m× 100  m grid-cells by integrating universal soil loss equation (USLE) model with GIS for subsequent identification of critical <b>erosion</b> <b>prone</b> areas. It was found that 82. 63 % area of the total watershed falls under slight-erosion-class (0 – 5  t-ha− 1 -yr− 1), 6. 87 % area lies under the moderate-erosion-class (5 – 10  t-ha− 1 -yr− 1), 5. 96 % area is under high-erosion-class (10 – 20  t-ha− 1 -yr− 1), 3. 3 % area of watershed lies under the very-high-erosion-class (20 – 40  t-ha− 1 -yr− 1) and 1. 24 % area falls under “severe-erosion-class” (40 – 80  t-ha− 1 -yr− 1). The study revealed that the sub-watershed KGSW 3 is critical due to the presence of the highest number of critical <b>erosion</b> <b>prone</b> grid-cells. The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) was also estimated to analyze the contribution of sediment yield at the sub-watershed level. Lowest SDR for the whole watershed as compared to sub-watersheds indicates that most of the eroded soil got deposited in rice crop check-basins before reaching the outlet.

This paper examines how projected climate change could affect soil erosion and water availability across China. We used both historical climate data (1961 - 1980) and the UKMO Hadley 3 climate scenario (1960 - 2099) to drive regional hydrology and soil erosivity models. The GCM predicts that eastern, and central China will experience a hotter and drier climate in the next 30 years. Available water could decrease by 20 %.

The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears {{to play an important}} role. Farmers living in the most <b>erosion</b> <b>prone</b> areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} soil {{stability}} of a gully wall in a gully <b>erosion</b> <b>prone</b> area of Central Eastern Nigeria. The {{objective was to}} investigate the physicochemical properties of the gully wall soils and to relate them to the collapsing and stability of the gullies. Ten soil layers were sampled for analysis. The bulk density was high while the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) was moderately high resulting in rapid permeability for the soil layers. The liquid limits (LL) and plastic limits (PL) were low. The water- stable aggregates (WSA) were mostly aggregates of < 0. 50 mm. Such soils with fine aggregate sizes erode more than those with bigger aggregate sizes. Mean-weight diameter (MWD) positively correlated significantly with plasticity index but negatively correlated with soil organic matter. Soil properties that related well with the dispersion indices were water-dispersible clay (WDC), moisture at field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), available water capacity (AWC), LL and plastic index (PI). The PI, K+, and Ca 2 + were the properties which increased aggregation while soil organic matter (SOM) which was low in the soil played little or no role in the aggregation of the studied soils...|$|E
