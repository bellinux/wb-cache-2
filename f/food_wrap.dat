40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of replacing a corrugated container with a multiwall paper bag for the packaging of <b>food</b> <b>wraps</b> used in the 2 ̆ 2 Quick - Serve 2 ̆ 2 foodservice industry. The study was limited to one specific restaurant chain and for only one size of <b>food</b> <b>wraps.</b> Laboratory testing was used to compare the performance attributes of both package systems. This study will provide a model for quantifying package source reduction when comparing a rigid package design to a flexible one. The results show that, indeed, a multiwall paper bag is a feasible alternative to a corrugated container when packaging <b>food</b> <b>wraps</b> and that significant source reduction can be realized from this change. Immediate and significant cost savings will also be achieved if the alternate package system is used for this foodservice application...|$|R

5000|$|Plastic wrap, {{cling film}} (UK), cling wrap, <b>food</b> <b>wrap,</b> or {{pliofilm}} {{is a thin}} plastic film typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh {{over a longer period}} of time. Plastic wrap, typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common plastic wrap is roughly 0.5 Thousandth of an inch (12.5 μm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner plastic wrap, particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 μm thick.|$|E

40|$|Context: The <b>food</b> <b>wrap</b> {{films are}} used to cover the tip of curing light units {{in order to avoid}} {{contamination}} and prevent damage to the light guide. However, their effects on resin polymerization are not fully known. Aims: We investigated the effects on restoration efficiency of a <b>food</b> <b>wrap</b> protective barrier used on the tip of curing light units. Materials and Methods: For each treatment, five replications were performed, a total of 60 bovine incisor. The degree of conversion (%DC) of restorations with the composite resin Opallis EA 2 was evaluated using 3 curing light devices (Optilux 501, Optilight and Ultra LED) and 2 curing distances (0 and 5 mm). The composite resin was tested for restoration of cavities in bovine crowns. %DC values were measured by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance technique. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed using 3 -way ANOVA and Tukey′s test. Results: Use of the protective film lowered %DC (F = 4. 13; P = 0. 05), and the effects of curing distance were associated to the curing light device (F = 3. 61; P = 0. 03). Conclusions: The distance from the light curing tip and use of a translucent protective barrier on the light-cure device can both impair composite resin %DC...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse {{reflectance}} spectra measured during shipboard core description with {{a hand-held}} Minolta spectrophotometer are reliable data for interpreting sediment composition. Factor {{analysis of these}} spectra indicates that only Glad Cling WrapTM, a polyethylene <b>food</b> <b>wrap,</b> {{should be used to}} cover wet cores during measurement because it introduces substantially less noise into the spectra than other brands of plastic <b>food</b> <b>wrap.</b> This validates our previous recommendation that only Glad Cling WrapTM should be used to cover wet core surfaces before spectral analysis on board ship. Factor analysis also indicates that the red end of the spectrum was a little noisy; however, it is unclear if this noise was produced by the Glad Cling WrapTM, by the Minolta instrument, or by the sediment being analyzed when wet (water tends to affect the red end of the spectrum more than the violet). Comparison of spectra taken directly from wet cores on board ship with the Minolta CM- 2002 to those taken from dried, prepared samples with our shore-based Perkin-Elmer Lambda 6 spectrophotometer indicates that water mutes the spectral signal. Although factor analysis of the Perkin-Elmer data produced five factors, four of those factors are the same as the factors extracted from the wet core data with the Minolta. This suggests that the water content in the wet cores was not high enough to seriously hinder interpretation of sediment composition. These four common factors are interpreted as carbonate, chlorite or glauconite, organic matter, and iron oxides (probably a mixture of hematite and goethite). The presence of hematite can be attributed to hematite-rich sediment derived from the Canadian Maritime provinces, which has been transported southward by the Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) along North American continental margin. Based on the distribution of hematite down the Leg 164 holes, the WBUC apparently has washed over the Leg 164 sites on the crest of the Blake Ridge only during the Holocene and very latest Pleistocene...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Food {{contamination}} {{occurs during}} post process handling. This leads to spoilage {{and growth of}} pathogenic microorganisms in the food, thereby reducing its shelf life or spreading of food borne diseases. Several methods are tried and {{one of which is}} use of antimicrobial packaging. Here, papain, a protease enzyme, is covalently immobilized with the help of glutarldehyde on polyurethane and used as a <b>food</b> <b>wrap</b> to protect food from microbial contamination. Covalent immobilization of papain was achieved at a pH of 7. 4; temperature of 4 °C; glutaraldehyde concentration of 0. 5 %; incubation time of 24 h; and 50 mg of papain. The formation of-C=N-observed in the Fourier transform infrared spectrum confirmed the immobilization of the enzyme on the polymer. Immobilized enzyme retained higher activity than the native free enzyme. The modified polyurethane showed better reduction of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm than bare polymer film (eight folds reduction in live colonies, two times reduction in protein and 6 times reduction in carbohydrates). The efficacy of this was studied by wrapping it over S. aureus contaminated cottage cheese (paneer) and cheese and stored at a temperature of 4 °C for 7 days. The modified film reduced the bacterial contamination by eight folds when compared to the bare film. FTIR also indicated reduction in lipids, sugars and proteins in the biofilm.
