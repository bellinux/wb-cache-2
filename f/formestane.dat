50|$|<b>Formestane</b> {{is often}} used to {{suppress}} the production of estrogens from anabolic steroids or prohormones. It also acts as a prohormone to 4-hydroxytestosterone, an active steroid which displays weak androgenic activity in addition to acting as a weak aromatase inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|After the Brodies {{demonstrated}} {{the reduction of}} estrogen levels in rodents and its biological efficacy with regression of rat mammary tumors, Angela Brodie went to Rome in the fall 1981 to give a presentation about her research. At the presentation was Charles Coombes a medical oncologist who expressed his interests in conducting a clinical trial with 4-hydroxy-androstenedione (4-OH-A) to treat breast cancer. [...] The collaboration of Angela Brodie, Charles Coombes a clinical oncologist, Paul Goss a clinical ongologist and Mitch Dowsett a clinical chemist and made this possible.

40|$|<b>Formestane</b> (4 -hydroxy-androstenedione) is an {{aromatase}} inhibitor prohibited {{in sports}} and included, since 2004, {{in the list of}} prohibited substances updated yearly by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

A total of 547 patients were enrolled. Analyses revealed no statistically significant or clinically relevant difference between treatments with respect to time endpoints. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the median values for time to failure and overall survival for <b>formestane</b> were 169 and 561 days, respectively. The corresponding values for megestrol acetate were 169 days and 597 days, respectively.

40|$|<b>Formestane</b> (4 -hydroxy- 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione) is an anti-estrogenic drug {{used on the}} {{treatment}} of breast cancer. It is a type I aromatase inhibitor acting as a “suicide substrate”. In women it suppresses the estrogens formation and then can be used therapeutically in those pathologies that are estrogen dependent (i. e. breast cancer). In humans, estrogens are strong pituitary inhibitors of gonadotrophins releasing factors. The inhibition of the estrogens synthesis produces an increase of luteinizing hormone (LH) and then a net increase of testosterone production is observed. In addition the combined administration with testosterone and/or its precursors (i. e. androstenedione) will reduce the side effects linked to aromatization like gynecomastia. For these reasons, anti-estrogenic substances including aromatase inhibitors were included in 2004 in the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) List of Prohibited substances in sports. The basic analytical methodologies developed so far are based on GC/MS or LC/MS, targeting <b>formestane</b> itself. It has been demonstrated that traces of <b>formestane</b> can be produced endogenously and found in urine samples in concentrations as low as 0. 5 - 20 ng/mL and thus, since 2011, it is mandatory according to the WADA rules to perform a confirmation based on GC/C/IRMS {{in order to assess}} the synthetic origin of <b>formestane</b> for samples below 150 ng/mL before releasing an adverse analytical finding. Different IRMS methods have been already described in the literature, generally requiring two consecutive liquid chromatographic purifications (HPLC) before obtaining an extract of adequate purity for the subsequent IRMS analysis. The metabolism of <b>formestane</b> has been described in a single male volunteer. It appears that among the high number of metabolites described, 3 b, 4 a-dihydroxy- 5 a-androstan- 17 -one (4 a-hydroxy-epiandrosterone; 4 OH-EA) has a longer detection window.

40|$|In breast cancer, stromal cells {{surrounding}} cancer {{epithelial cells}} can influence phenotype by producing paracrine factors. Among many mediators of epithelial-stromal interactions, aromatase activity is {{perhaps one of}} the best studied. Clinical data suggest that estrogen-independent signaling leads to increased proliferation even during therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Molecular mechanism of crosstalk between the estrogen receptor (ER) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family have been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapy, but this interaction is unclear. The ability of aromatase to induce estradiol biosynthesis provides a molecular rationale to combine agents that target aromatase activity and the HER pathway. We targeted stromal-epithelial interactions using <b>formestane,</b> which exerts antiaromatase activity, combined with the monoclonal anti-HER 2 antibody herceptin, in a subpopulation of CD 44 +/CD 24 low cells sorted from epithelial-mesenchymal co-cultures of breast cancer tissues. The growth inhibition was respectively 16 % (P < 0. 01) in the response to herceptin, 25 % to <b>formestane</b> (P < 0. 01), and 50 % (P < 0. 001) with the combination of the two drugs, suggesting that herceptin cooperates with formestane-induced inhibition of aromatase and this effect could be mediated through HER family receptors. In cells which expressed ERalpha, formestane/herceptin combination suppressed the mRNA expression of aromatase and HER 2 and decreased cyclin D 1 expression.

Synthetic THF-diols inhibited rat male and female sexual behavior at oral concentrations of 0. 5 – 1 ppm, and stimulated MCF- 7 human breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro. OBJECTIVES: Because THF-diols are derived from lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways, we suspected that these compounds may regulate cell proliferation by modulating specific enzymatic sites involved in linoleic acid metabolism including phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), lipoxygenases (LOX- 5 and LOX- 12), cyclooxygenases (COX- 1 and COX- 2), and closely coupled enzymes including aromatase (AROM).

The use of a short column, high-flow carrier gas velocity and fast temperature ramping produced an efficient separation of all analytes in about 4 Â min, allowing a processing rate of 10 Â samples/h. The present analytical method was validated according to UNI EN ISO/IEC 17025 guidelines for qualitative methods. The range of investigated parameters included the limit of detection, selectivity, linearity, repeatability, robustness and extraction efficiency. High MS-sampling rate, using a benchtop quadrupole mass analyzer, resulted in accurate peak shape definition under both scan and selected ion monitoring modes, and high sensitivity in the latter mode. Therefore, the performances of the method are comparable to the ones obtainable from traditional GC/MS analysis.

The use of a short column, high-flow carrier gas velocity and fast temperature ramping produced an efficient separation of all analytes in about 4 min, allowing a processing rate of 10 samples/h. The present analytical method was validated according to UNI EN ISO/IEC 17025 guidelines for qualitative methods. The range of investigated parameters included the limit of detection, selectivity, linearity, repeatability, robustness and extraction efficiency. High MS-sampling rate, using a benchtop quadrupole mass analyzer, resulted in accurate peak shape definition under both scan and selected ion monitoring modes, and high sensitivity in the latter mode. Therefore, the performances of the method are comparable to the ones obtainable from traditional GC/MS analysis. The method was successfully tested on real samples arising from clinical treatments of hospitalized patients and could profitably be used for clinical studies on anti-estrogenic drug administration...|$|E
40|$|Anastrozole is {{the first}} {{aromatase}} inhibitor to show a significant survival advantage over megestrol acetate in post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer. The rationale for extending the use of aromatase inhibitors {{to the treatment of}} early breast cancer is based on the efficacy observed in the advanced setting, combined with good tolerability and a convenient dosing regimen. Furthermore, oestrogen deprivation by ovarian ablation (similar to oestrogen antagonism with tamoxifen) is already established as an effective adjuvant treatment in premenopausal women with modality breast cancer. Anastrozole produces a profound suppression of plasma oestrogen levels which is greater than that obtained with earlier aromatase inhibitors (<b>formestane,</b> aminoglutethimide) or megestrol acetate. This could account for the differences in clinical efficacy seen between anastrozole and megestrol acetate. In terms of benefits over other endocrine agents, anastrozole causes significantly less weight gain than megestrol acetate; it does not have the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen, and is unlikely to lead to tumour stimulation in patients resistant to tamoxifen or to exert proliferative effects on the endometrium. The lack of oestrogen agonist activity, however, may possibly have detrimental effects on bone mineral density and blood lipid profile. Current clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of anastrozole in the early breast cancer setting. The results of these trials will help to determine whether anastrozole has any benefits over tamoxifen, the current treatment of choice in post-menopausal women with early breast cancer...|$|E
