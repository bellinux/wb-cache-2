25|$|Resident {{locomotives}} include NER Class C1 <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> No. 876 (British Railways Class J21 No. 65033), {{built at}} Gateshead in 1889. After lying {{out of use}} since 1984 it {{was moved to the}} North Norfolk Railway for restoration in 2007. A syndicate has now been formed and an appeal made for contributions. The museum also formerly operated its Hawthorn Leslie industrial engine No. 14.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, DB's last steam {{express train}} made its final {{run on the}} Emsland-Line from Rheine to Norddeich in the upper north of Germany. Two years later, on 26 October 1977, the heavy <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> 44 903 (computer-based new number 043 903-4) made her final run at the same railway yard. After this date, no regular steam service {{took place on the}} network of the DB until their {{privatisation}} in 1994.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, 1913, {{the swing}} {{bridge across the}} Severn River on the Line was opened for a {{schooner}} when <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> Number 5 with six cars was ahead of schedule. The bridge could not be closed in time and the engine and all cars {{ended up at the}} bottom of the Severn River. No one was injured, but for six days the passengers had to be ferried across the river.|$|E
5000|$|Series 2900 ('Driemaster'): A {{class of}} 0-6-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> built by Beyer Peacock between 1865 and 1878. They were nicknamed 'Driemaster' or 'Three-master', {{as they were}} the first six-coupled <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> built in the country. Originally owned by the SS.|$|R

25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
500|$|The {{highly unusual}} and {{controversial}} design represents the ultimate {{development of the}} British 0-6-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engine,</b> capable of hauling trains that were usually allocated to much larger locomotives on other railways. Nicknames for the class included [...] "Ugly Ducklings", [...] "Coffee Pots" [...] and [...] "Charlies".|$|E
2500|$|In July 1933, {{the economy}} was {{beginning}} to revive after the Great Depression and the company promoted 18 firemen {{running out of the}} DeWitt yards to engineers. It was announced they would start as freight engineers and replace <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> drivers who had been promoted to the passenger service. It also resulted in the hiring of 18 new firemen and additional brakemen and other trainmen were needed to [...] "man the new trains." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1994 {{the units}} {{were used in}} the channel tunnel as motor engines for TTU trains. (Channel tunnel <b>freight</b> <b>engines)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, the Duluth and Iron Range Railway {{ordered a}} number of trim-lined Mastodons, {{beginning}} in 1893, which were reportedly the heaviest <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> constructed at the time. They had long, between-the-drivers fireboxes and a relatively short stroke for <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> of the era. They were numbered from 60 to 89 and became the railroad's class J. After 1900, they were gradually phased {{out in favor of}} the more conventional Consolidation type. All were scrapped by 1933.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freight</b> <b>engines</b> with an 0-8-0 wheel {{arrangement}} {{were once}} {{very popular in}} Germany. The Prussian state railways had several types of 0-8-0s that were all classified as G7, G8 and G9.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the fair}} (also called The Chicago World's Fair), he became acquainted with No. 638, a big new <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> IC had on display {{as the latest}} and {{greatest}} technological advancement in trains. It had eight drive wheels and two pilot wheels, a 2-8-0 [...] "Consolidation" [...] type. At {{the closing of the}} fair, No. 638 was due to be sent to Water Valley for service in the Jackson District. Jones asked for permission to drive the engine back to Water Valley. His request was approved, and No. 638 ran its first [...] with Jones at the throttle to Water Valley. Jones liked No. 638 and liked working in the Jackson District because his family was there. They had once moved to Water Valley, but returned to Jackson, which they felt was home.|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) {{originally}} {{dispatched a}} single engine {{company with a}} four-person crew for a [...] "possible physical rescue" [...] at a residential address near the scene {{in response to a}} 9-1-1 emergency call from the home. The crew arrived at the address four minutes later, just before 16:30 PDT and accessed the scene by cutting through the backyard fence. Upon arrival, the captain on the scene immediately called for an additional five ambulances, then 30 fire engines, and after reaching the wreck he called for every heavy search and rescue unit in the city. Hundreds of emergency workers were eventually involved in the rescue and recovery efforts, including 250 firefighters. [...] Two Los Angeles city firefighters received medals for risking their lives to enter a confined space with smokey and potentially toxic air, without their air bottles, to rescue one of the freight train engineers. LAPD Devonshire Division, Patrol Officers arrived on scene shortly after the first LAFD Engine Company. As firefighters were putting out the flames of the burning diesel fuel that had spilled out of the <b>freight</b> <b>engine,</b> Patrol Officers entered the damaged, smoke-filled train cars to rescue/administer first aid to several passengers who were stranded on the upper decks due to their critical injuries. Two Officers received medals, and two received commendations and were credited with potentially saving the lives of several injured passengers.|$|E

50|$|Engine {{production}} was active between 1885 and 1917. Engines were produced for other roads as well. The production figures for 1882 list 19 passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> outshopped, with 16 more in 1883.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 Plaistow had an {{allocation}} of 83 locomotives, the majority (70) {{of which were}} tank engines for passenger traffic to and from Fenchurch Street with 6 <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> and 7 shunting engines making up the balance.|$|R
50|$|The Kansas City Southern {{used the}} type as <b>freight</b> <b>engines,</b> with pilots, {{and had the}} most of them with twelve locomotives. The 0-6-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} was also used to a limited extent on logging railroads and in mountain terminals.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over, {{and in the}} end it was agreed that Dick and Sam should ride on the flat car, while Tom went with Stanley and Jack Mason in the automobile. Then the section boss went off to get the <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> to haul the flat car.|$|E
60|$|The others {{went off}} in the touring auto, and Dick and Sam made {{themselves}} {{at home on the}} flat car. Soon a <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> backed up, the car was attached; and off they started, in company with the section boss and two track laborers, in the direction of Ashton.|$|E
60|$|Two {{hours later}} an Iron Mountain <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> {{pulled out of}} the {{railroad}} yards, Texas bound, with a string of empties. In one of the cattle cars, half buried in excelsior, Chicken lay at ease. Beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese. Mr. Ruggles, in his private car, was on his trip south for the winter season.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{classes of}} {{specialised}} <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> on NZR, {{eight of the}} ten BA locomotives were modified to perform shunting duties. This included an all-weather cab fixture on the tender to provide shelter for crews, and second sand domes.|$|R
5000|$|... 5471, {{built at}} Crewe in 1938, {{would be the}} last built for five years. During {{the early stages of the}} Second World War, the {{priority}} was for heavy <b>freight</b> <b>engines,</b> and the closely related 8Fs were produced in large numbers.|$|R

50|$|In 1915, the New York Central {{purchased}} an 0-8-8-0 numbered 2000 but {{proved to}} be very unreliable and also very costly to maintain as it jumped the rails quite often. Eventually in the 1930s, it was split into two locomotives, a useful 2-8-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> and a 0-8-0 switcher engine. The switcher engine was sold for scrap by 1950. The 2-8-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engine</b> maintained into service until NYC dieselization during the mid 1950s. The 2-8-0 and 0-8-0 locomotives that were from the 0-8-8-0 chassis locomotive do not exist anymore.|$|E
50|$|The 0-8-0 wheel {{arrangement}} appeared {{early in}} locomotive {{development in the}} United States, during the mid-1840s. The configuration became popular and was more commonly constructed as a tender locomotive. It saw extensive use as a heavy switcher and <b>freight</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Hitachi {{traction}} motors {{are the ones}} used on <b>freight</b> <b>engines.</b> It was a challenge to put these in a passenger engine due to weight constraints. So the transformer is aluminum foil-wound and aluminum chequered plates are used for reducing the weight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of heavy <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> and the running {{times of the}} train, daylight through spectacular scenery, made the W44 Concentrate train a popular photographic target by railfans documenting the last phase of steam engine use of the New South Wales Government Railways.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to those mainly passenger locomotives, many new classes of <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> were produced: the pannier tank locomotives of the GWR and the Garratt heavy freight 2-6-0+0-6-2 locomotive of the LMS (although the latter were not a huge success {{and only a few}} were built) being two examples.|$|R

50|$|The next of {{the type}} were a class of ten ordered by the Seaboard Air Line in 1935 and 1937. These were high speed <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> and were successful. Upon {{dieselisation}} the road sold the locomotives to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1947, who operated them until 1953.|$|R
50|$|They {{were the}} last, and largest design of {{purpose-built}} switch engines that the Soo Line owned, any heavier switching duties were performed by down-graded 2-8-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engines.</b> All {{were still on}} the active roster in May 1953, but all had been retired by the end December 1954 when the railroad completed its dieselization.|$|R
5000|$|Series 2800: These {{were the}} first 0-6-0 <b>freight</b> <b>engines</b> on the NRS. They were built by Beyer Peacock from 1865 to 1881. After the NRS was bought out, the engines were divided between the HSM and the SS. By the time the NS was formed, only the SS engines came into service.|$|R
