40|$|Procedure to {{establish}} full {{contact between the}} sample and the 1  mm diameter cylindrical <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> tip to measure polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mechanical properties using the Hysitron TriboIndenter is described. This procedure differs from the standard automated indentation because each indent has to be performed manually after establishing full contact with the sample surface. Incomplete contact happens because of the sample tilt {{with respect to the}} <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> surface and results in incorrect elastic modulus values. • Automated indentation results in incorrect values of the elastic modulus due to initial incomplete contact between the <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> and the PDMS sample surface, caused by the tilt, and using the unloading slope, which is affected by viscoelastic soft polymer deformation. • Correct procedure requires establishing the full contact between the tip and the sample. This is achieved by moving the tip into the sample in 1 – 2  μm increments, up to 40 – 80  μm maximum combined displacement, until the loading stiffness no longer increases. • The elastic modulus is calculated from the loading stiffness and the diameter of the <b>flat</b> <b>punch,</b> instead of the unloading stiffness, which is larger due to viscoelastic unloading.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Solids and Structures and the definitive published version is available at [URL] the present paper we explore the response of a half-plane indented by a tilted <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> with sharp corners {{in the context of}} couple-stress elasticity theory. Contact conditions arise in a number of modern engineering applications ranging from structural and geotechnical engineering to micro and nanotechnology. As the contact scales reduce progressively the effects of the microstructure upon the macroscopic material response cannot be ignored. The generalized continuum theory of couple-stress elasticity introduces characteristic material lengths in order to describe the pertinent scale effects that emerge from the underlying material microstructure. The problem under investigation is interesting for three reasons: Firstly, the indentor's geometry is simple so that benchmark results may be extracted. Secondly, important deterioration of the macroscopic results may emerge in the case that a tilting moment is applied on the indentor inadvertently or in the case that the <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> itself is not self-aligning so that asymmetrical contact pressure distributions arise on the contact faces. Thirdly, the voluntary application of a tilting moment on the <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> during an experiment gives rise to potential capabilities of the <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> for the determination of the material microstructural characteristic lengths. The solution methodology is based on singular integral equations which have resulted from a treatment of the mixed boundary value problem via integral transforms and generalized functions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article explores {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) mechanical properties, {{and presents}} nanoindentation experiments with Berkovich and <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> indenters. In the Berkovich tip quasi-static nanoindentation test, there are pull-in and pull-off events observed {{during the initial}} tip contact, and when withdrawing from the surface, respectively. The pull-in interaction needs to be accounted for to properly determine the initial contact point, and thus the accurate contact area. Once accounted for the pull-in event, the Berkovich and <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> tips quasi-static nanoindentation tests give comparable results of about 1. 5 MPa for the PDMS elastic modulus (5 : 1 elastomer base to the curing agent ratio). However, PDMS unloading stiffness {{is higher than the}} loading stiff-ness, and dynamic PDMS testing yields higher elastic modulus of about 3. 6 MPa. While these results are comparable with the large strain macroscopic compression test results, the difference underscores the complexity of elastomer mechanical characterization and illustrates the discrepancies typical of the reported values.

40|$|AbstractThe ‘plane vs. plane’ contact {{involving}} <b>flat</b> <b>punches</b> {{has been}} the subject of many investigations, even in recent years, mainly due to the crucial role that such components play in phenomena, such as fretting fatigue and indentation tests. While the problem has been deeply approached from a theoretical point of view, there is a noteworthy lack of experimental verifications due to the limited number of laboratory techniques capable of supplying detailed information about contact parameters. In order to make a partial contribution towards gaining an understanding of such problems, this study proposes the investigation of <b>flat</b> rounded <b>punch</b> contact with an ultrasound-based technique, which exploits the properties of ultrasonic waves to be differently reflected by a contact interface depending on its stress state. A suitable setup was built in such a way as to ensure a good level of control of contact conditions, and the interface was scanned with a high-frequency ultrasonic transducer so as to acquire the reflection data. While the graphic processing of the ultrasonic coefficient of reflection may easily be displayed as a ‘contact map’, the quantitative accuracy of the method was also investigated by comparing experimental results with those obtained from a Finite Element model of the system. The results show a good level of agreement between the two approaches, thus confirming that the ultrasonic technique can be effectively employed to investigate many contact problems which to date have never (or scarcely) been experimentally validated...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{materials}} used were the Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers. PDMS mechanicals properties were measured using a customized version of the nanoindentation test using a <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> tip. The method is proposed in Chapter 3 and {{it is used to}} calculate the elastic modulus of different PDMS samples. The samples tested were both produced specifically for this research and available in the laboratory’s storage. They all present different levels of cross-linking degree. It is quite common to not have full contact between the cylindrical <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> and the sample because of the unavoidable tilt. The new method guarantees establishing full contact between the sample and the tip. The tip used for this purpose is a <b>flat</b> <b>punch</b> tip. The Young’s moduli of the following samples were calculated: 10 : 1, 30 : 1 and 50 : 1. The Young’s moduli found were: 2. 85 ± 0. 001 MPa for the 10 : 1 sample, 0. 34 ± 0. 001 MPa for the 30 : 1 sample and 0. 15 ± 0. 002 MPa for the 50 : 1 sample. All the experiments were repeated at least three times to assure the validity and the repeatability of the method. The results were then compared with values available in the literature. The same method was applied to analyze the viscosity of the samples. Even if a mathematical result was not obtained, data and analysis through graphical representations are available in this thesis.

40|$|International audienceMost {{biological}} hairy adhesive {{systems of}} insects, arachnids and reptiles, involved in locomotion, rely not on <b>flat</b> <b>punches</b> on their tips, {{but rather on}} spatulate structures. Several hypotheses have been previously proposed to explain the functional importance of this particular contact geometry: (1) enhancement of adaptability to the rough substrate; (2) contact formation by shear force rather than by normal load; (3) increase of total peeling line due to using an array of multiple spatulae; (4) contact breakage by peeling off. In the present paper, we used numerical approach to study dynamics of spatulate tips during contact formation on rough substrates. The model clearly demonstrates that the contact area increases under applied shear force, especially when spatulae are misaligned prior to the contact formation. Applied shear force has an optimum describing the situation when maximal contact is formed but no slip occurs. At such equilibrium maximal adhesion can be generated. This principle manifests the crucial role of spatulate terminal elements in biological fibrillar adhesion...|$|R

Notable increase of yield and ultimate strengths corresponding to 358 MPa and 381 MPa after four passes of RF from the initial values of 121 MPa and 230. 5 MPa is detectable. Microhardness increases to about 100 Hv after four passes of RF from the initial value of 53 Hv.

In this context, little in-depth {{work has been}} done for soft bio-materials like biofilms, tissues, gels, cells, etc. Such materials show large elastic strains when subjected to relatively fast loading (excluding viscoelastic phenomena). The present work focuses on the adhesive contact of such materials. <b>Flat</b> <b>punches</b> of circular imprint are used and are subjected to pullout normal forces or bending moments. The materials are modeled as hyperelastic (fast-testing conditions), using the Mooney-Rivlin (M-R) strain energy density function. We examine both incompressibility and compressibility issues. The contact problem of half-space materials interacting with rigid indenters is solved explicitly for moderate deformations and is compared with finite element results. Experiments are conducted with an artificial material (gel, reinforced with talc powder) that is modeled as a hyperelastic material. The present work is expected to extend indentation testing to important technologies like medical applications (health monitoring of tissues) and food industries (quality control of various production stages). It is concluded that the adhesive contact can be used to estimate the initial elastic modulus of soft substrates, but not all the material constants required by the hyperelastic models.
