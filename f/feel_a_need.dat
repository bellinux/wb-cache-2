5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.|$|E

For that reason the Culture carries out [...] "good works", covertly or overtly interfering in the development of lesser civilizations, with the main aim to gradually guide them towards less damaging paths. As Culture citizens see it these good works provide the Culture with a [...] "moral right to exist".|$|E

2500|$|Fort Ellis , el. [...] was {{established}} in 1867 by Captain R. S. LaMotte and two companies of the 2nd Cavalry, after the murder of John Bozeman {{near the mouth of}} Mission Creek on Yellowstone River , and considerable political disturbance in the area led local settlers and miners to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for added protection. The fort, named for Gettysburg casualty Colonel Augustus Van Horne Ellis, was decommissioned in 1886 and few remnants are left at the actual site, now occupied by the Fort Ellis Experimental Station of Montana State University. In addition to Fort Ellis, a short-lived fort, Fort Elizabeth Meagher (also simply known as Fort Meagher), {{was established}} in 1867 by volunteer militiamen.

2500|$|Craig Raine, in {{his books}} In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2001) and T. S. Eliot (2006), sought to defend Eliot from {{the charge of}} anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated {{that he was not}} {{convinced}} by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, [...] "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains." [...] In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, [...] "Why do critics <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [...] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian was [...] "heartsick" [...] that Pet Sounds didn't sell {{as highly}} as he expected, and {{interpreted}} the response as a rejection to his creative ideals. Some blamed Capitol Records for the album's underwhelming sales. Allegedly, {{they did not}} promote the album as heavily as previous releases. Carl stated that Capitol did not <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to promote the Beach Boys since they were getting so much airplay, {{and that they had}} a [...] "set image" [...] for the group which even Pet Sounds could not alter. Others assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on. To Brian's dismay, within two months, Capitol assembled the group's first greatest hits compilation, Best of The Beach Boys, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. Capitol executive Karl Engemann later said: [...] "This is just conjecture on my part because it was so long ago... because the marketing people didn't believe that Pet Sounds was going to do that well, they were probably looking for some additional volume in that quarter. There's a good possibility that's what happened. Anyway, my real forte was dealing with artists and producers and making them feel comfortable so they could achieve their ends. And sometimes, particularly when the label wanted something that the artist didn't, it wasn't easy.|$|E

6000|$|Currant-loaf is now popular {{eating in}} all households. For {{weeks before the}} great morning, confectioners display stacks of Scots bun--a dense, black substance, inimical to life--and full moons of shortbread adorned with mottoes of peel or sugar-plum, in honour {{of the season and}} the family affections. [...] "Frae Auld Reekie," [...] "A guid New Year to ye a'," [...] "For the Auld Folk at Hame," [...] are among the most favoured of these devices. Can you not see the carrier, after half-a-day's journey on {{pinching}} hill-roads, draw up before a cottage in Teviotdale, or perhaps in Manor Glen among the rowans, and the old people receiving the parcel with moist eyes and a prayer for Jock or Jean in the city? For at this season, on the threshold of another year of calamity and stubborn conflict, men <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> to draw closer the links that unite them; they reckon the number of their friends, like allies before a war; and the prayers grow longer in the morning as the absent are recommended by name into God's keeping.|$|E
6000|$|Now the {{essential}} trouble {{of my life}} is its petty weaknesses. If I am to have that love, that sense of understanding fellowship, which is, I conceive, the peculiar magic and merit of this idea of a personal Saviour, then I need someone quite other than this image of virtue, this terrible and incomprehensible Galilean with his crown of thorns, his blood-stained hands and feet. I cannot love him any more than I can love a man upon the rack. Even {{in the face of}} torments I do not think I should <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for him. I had rather then a hundred times have Botticelli's armed angel in his Tobit at Florence. (I hope I do not seem to want to shock in writing these things, but indeed my only aim is to lay my feelings bare.) I know what love for an idealized person can be. It happens that in my younger days I found a character in the history of literature who had a singular and extraordinary charm for me, of whom the thought was tender and comforting, who indeed helped me through shames and humiliations as though he held my hand. This person was Oliver Goldsmith. His blunders and troubles, his vices and vanities, seized and still hold my imagination. The slights of Boswell, the contempt of Gibbon and all his company save Johnson, the exquisite fineness of spirit in his [...] "Vicar of Wakefield," [...] and that green suit of his and the doctor's cane and the love despised, these things together made him a congenial saint and hero for me, so that I thought of him as others pray. When I think of that youthful feeling for Goldsmith, I know what I need in a personal Saviour, as a troglodyte who has seen a candle can imagine the sun. But the Christian Christ in none of his three characteristic phases, neither as the magic babe (from whom I am cut off by the wanton and indecent purity of the Immaculate Conception), nor as the white-robed, spotless miracle worker, nor as the fierce unreal torment of the cross, comes close to my soul. I do not understand the Agony in the Garden; to me it is like a scene from a play in an unknown tongue. The la t cry of despair is the one human touch, discordant {{with all the rest of}} the story. One cry of despair does not suffice. The Christian's Christ is too fine for me, not incarnate enough, not flesh enough, not earth enough. He was never foolish and hot-eared and inarticulate, never vain, he never forgot things, nor tangled his miracles. I could love him I think more easily if the dead had not risen and if he had lain in peace in his sepulchre instead of coming back more enhaloed and whiter than ever, as a postscript to his own tragedy.|$|E
