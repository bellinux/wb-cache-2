5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes <b>flashover</b> between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{efforts to}} confine and {{extinguish}} the fire, {{it continued to}} spread into the structure and ignited furniture in the showroom, growing more quickly than the few operating hose lines could control. Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional hose lines continued. At 7:41p.m. the showroom area of the store experienced a <b>flashover</b> while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The <b>flashover</b> contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the <b>flashover</b> were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire. Several calls for help were made by trapped firefighters and efforts to rescue them were commenced. These efforts proved unsuccessful. By the time the fire was brought under control, nine Charleston firefighters had been killed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This report {{deals with}} the choice and {{dimensioning}} of the HV insulators for the Three Gorges HVDC converter stations, and concentrates on the outdoor DC insulators for Longquan station, since Zhengping station has an indoor DC-yard. At {{the analysis of the}} specification it has been found that dimensioning criteria given in the specification are consistent with the experiences from other converter stations. In the past, horizontal porcelain wall bushings and large diameter porcelains used for measuring equipment on pole potential contributed to more than 75 % of all <b>flashovers.</b> The <b>flashovers</b> on wall bushings are due to uneven wetting during rain, and occur also at low pollution. The <b>flashovers</b> on the vertical large diameter porcelains are mainly pollution <b>flashovers</b> at fog or light rain. It has been proved that these <b>flashovers</b> can be prevented if the insulator surface is water repellant, by using coatings or silicone rubber insulators. For all apparatus, special consideration has been made to ensure proper coordination between external and internal voltage grading for DC and impulse voltage stresses. For porcelains, all DC insulators used will be 95 / 95 deep underrib to ensure good performance during heavy rain...|$|R

25|$|Air Canada Flight 797 was a {{scheduled}} trans-border flight that flew from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Montréal–Dorval International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Toronto Pearson International Airport. On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer {{skin and the}} inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked {{out most of the}} instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created <b>flashover</b> conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft. Blood tests showed some of the passengers had inhaled lethal amounts of toxins from the in-flight fire, likely meaning they were already dead in their seats before the plane touched down.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to <b>flashover</b> and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E

2500|$|Some fire {{fighting}} tactics {{may appear to}} be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [...] "ventilation" [...] firefighters are often forced to open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called [...] "vertical ventilation") or open windows or walls (called [...] "horizontal ventilation") to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility facilitating locating victims more quickly. This also helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it vents the poisonous gases from inside of the structure. Vertical ventilation is absolutely vital to firefighter safety {{in the event of a}} <b>flashover</b> or backdraft scenario. Releasing the flammable gasses through the roof often eliminates the possibility of a backdraft and by the removal of heat the possibility of a <b>flashover</b> is reduced significantly. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900–1200° Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments are almost always fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, often reveal backdraft situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.|$|E

This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the commutator and brushes in the generator. [...] Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed {{of the possibility of}} a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a <b>flashover,</b> which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.|$|E
40|$|Capítulos en librosThe usual {{lightning}} protection of high volt-age overhead lines is {{the usage of}} groundwires. In some cases, they cannot be used. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of different alternative protection schemes using surge arresters for a 132 kV unshielded overhead line. The protection schemes are: a surge arrester at each conductor and tower, a surge arresters only at the central conductor and every tower (the configuration studied has the central conductor higher than lateral ones at therefore acts as a shield wire) and a surge arrester at each conductor and one out of two towers. The last two protective schemes are consid-ered due to economic reasons. Number of annual <b>flashovers</b> in a 100 km line with the different protec-tion schemes is computed following IEEE recommen-dations. Direct, induced and back <b>flashovers</b> are con-sidered. Over-voltages are computed using the ATP software package, distinguishing between tower, cen-tral conductor and lateral conductor lightning strokes.
