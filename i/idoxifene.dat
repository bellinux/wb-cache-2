50|$|<b>Idoxifene</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (former {{developmental}} code names CB-7432, SB-223030), {{also known}} as pyrrolidino-4-iodotamoxifen, is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group which was under development {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer and postmenopausal osteoporosis but was never marketed. It reached phase III clinical trials for postmenopausal osteoporosis and phase II clinical trials for breast cancer before development was discontinued in 1999 due insufficient effectiveness in both cases.|$|E
50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens chlorotrianisene, estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, broparestrol, clomifene, clomifenoxide, droloxifene, endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, <b>idoxifene,</b> miproxifene, miproxifene phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, panomifene, and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|The {{beneficial}} vasoprotective {{effects of}} oestrogens are hampered by their side effects on secondary sexual organs. Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERM) such as <b>idoxifene</b> may exert beneficial vascular effects without influencing cancerogenesis in breast or uterus. In order to investigate vascular effects of selective oestrogen receptor modulators, {{we examined the}} impact of <b>idoxifene</b> on production of reactive oxygen species as well as AT 1 receptor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). <b>Idoxifene</b> caused a concentration- and time-dependent down-regulation of AT 1 receptor mRNA expression, as assessed by Northern analysis. The maximal effect was reached with 10 [*]μmol[*]l− 1 <b>idoxifene</b> after a 4 [*]h incubation period (33 ± 7 % of control levels). Western blots showed a similar down-regulation of AT 1 receptor protein to 36 ± 11 % of control levels. Confocal laserscanning microscopy using the redox sensitive marker 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and measurement of NAD(P) H oxidase activity in cell homogenates revealed that <b>idoxifene</b> effectively blunted the angiotensin II-induced production of reactive oxygen species. In order to investigate the signal transduction involved in SERM-induced modulation of AT 1 receptor expression, VSMC were preincubation with PD 98059, genistein, wortmannin, or Nω-Nitro-L-arginine. The results suggested that <b>idoxifene</b> caused AT 1 receptor down-regulation through nitric oxide-dependent pathways. In conclusion, <b>idoxifene</b> reduces angiotensin II-evoked oxidative stress in VSMC. This could in part be explained by idoxifene-induced down-regulation of AT 1 receptor expression. These results demonstrate that the selective oestrogen receptor modulator <b>idoxifene</b> may exert beneficial vascular effects which could be useful for therapeutic regimen in postmenopausal women at risk for cardiovascular diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>idoxifene,</b> a novel anti-oestrogen with less agonist {{activity}} than tamoxifen, was {{compared with that}} of tamoxifen on the growth of hormone-dependent MCF- 7 breast cancer xenografts. Forty tumours were established with oestradiol support in ovariectomized athymic mice, allowed to grow to a median volume of 420 mm 3 and then continued with oestradiol, no support, tamoxifen or <b>idoxifene</b> delivered by 1. 5 -cm silastic capsule. Tumour regression occurred with both anti-oestrogens, although maximum regression was observed following oestradiol withdrawal alone. While prolonged anti-oestrogen therapy was associated with static growth, tumour volumes were significantly lower with <b>idoxifene</b> (P= 0. 01). After 6 months, 0 / 10 idoxifene-treated tumours developed acquired resistance compared with 3 / 10 tumours treated with tamoxifen. In separate experiments, 94 animals were treated initially with oestradiol, tamoxifen, <b>idoxifene</b> or placebo following implantation with 1 -mm 3 pieces of either wild-type (WT) or tamoxifen-resistant (TR) MCF- 7 tumour. After 4 months, only 1 / 11 WT tumours became established with <b>idoxifene</b> compared with 4 / 11 with tamoxifen, 8 / 12 with oestradiol and 0 / 12 with placebo. Likewise, fewer TR tumours were supported by <b>idoxifene</b> (3 / 12) than by tamoxifen (8 / 12) or oestrogen (11 / 12). These data indicate that, compared with tamoxifen, <b>idoxifene</b> shows reduced growth support of MCF- 7 xenografts and may share only partial cross-resistance. Furthermore, the development of acquired anti-oestrogen resistance may be reduced during long-term <b>idoxifene</b> therapy. The drug's reduced agonist activity may, in part, explain these observations and indicate a preferable biochemical profile for breast cancer treatment...|$|E
40|$|Pyrrolidino- 4 -iodotamoxifen (<b>idoxifene)</b> {{is a new}} non-steroidal antioestrogen {{currently}} undergoing phase I clinical evaluation. Using <b>idoxifene</b> and tamoxifen and {{two additional}} analogues of tamoxifen (3 -hydroxytamoxifen and 4 -iodotamoxifen) and the imidazole-based calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, a strong positive correlation (r 2 > 0. 95) was observed between cytotoxicity and inhibition of calmodulin-dependent cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (e. g. mean IC 50 across four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines of 4. 5 microM for <b>idoxifene</b> and 6. 3 microM for tamoxifen). Using two parent human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (41 M and CH 1; both oestrogen receptor negative) in which acquired resistance to doxorubicin or cisplatin has been generated, we have determined the ability of <b>idoxifene</b> to overcome resistance in these lines. At a non-toxic concentration of 2 microM, <b>idoxifene</b> appeared at least {{as effective as the}} clinically used multidrug resistance modifiers verapamil and tamoxifen in overcoming doxorubicin resistance in two acquired resistant cell lines shown to overexpress the P- 170 efflux glycoprotein. Non-cross-resistance between cisplatin and <b>idoxifene</b> was observed in two acquired resistant cell lines possessing contrasting mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin (41 McisR 6 reduced drug transport and CH 1 cisR 6 resistance mediated at the level of DNA). In one of four cell lines (CH 1), synergism between <b>idoxifene</b> and cisplatin was observed by median effect analysis. However, with the 41 M and its 6 -fold cisplatin-resistant variant, antagonism was observed. These observations made by median effect analysis appeared to be unrelated to platinum uptake or removal of platinum-induced DNA interstrand cross-links. These in vitro data suggest that <b>idoxifene</b> may be usefully combined with doxorubicin in the clinical setting, but caution should be exercised in combining it with cisplatin in the treatment of certain tumours...|$|E
40|$|Tamoxifen is an {{effective}} agent preventing mammary carcinogenesis in rats but causing liver tumours. <b>Idoxifene</b> is a more potent antioestrogen and is effective in patients with advanced breast cancer. We therefore compared the effects of <b>idoxifene</b> with tamoxifen on mammary carcinogenesis and hepatic DNA adduct formation. To do this, we undertook a study designed to compare tamoxifen with <b>idoxifene</b> as a chemopreventive agent in rats inoculated with N-methylnitrosourea (MNU) and also measured hepatic adduct formation. We examined the time to mammary tumour development in 272 female Ludwig/Wistar/Olac rats treated with MNU followed by tamoxifen (5 mg kg(- 1)), equimolar <b>idoxifene</b> or vehicle {{three times a week}} for up to 24 weeks. To determine duration of effect, a second study was carried out whereby all of the 129 animals surviving at the end of treatment were entered into a surveillance programme for 27 weeks {{after the end of the}} administration period. Hepatic DNA adduct formation was examined by 32 P-postlabelling in a group of rats after 24 weeks' treatment. In the first study, both <b>idoxifene</b> and tamoxifen were effective in preventing tumour growth as only 2 out of 21 (10 %) MNU and vehicle-treated animals were alive and tumour free after 24 weeks compared with 13 out of 22 (59 %) animals receiving MNU followed by <b>idoxifene</b> or tamoxifen (P < 0. 001). The second study showed that, in both idoxifene- and tamoxifen-treated animals, a progressive regrowth of tumours occurred after cessation of therapy, as by the end of the observation period only four idoxifene-treated animals and one tamoxifen-treated animal were free from disease. In the subset of animals tested, tamoxifen-treated animals had approximately 100 times higher levels of DNA hepatic adducts than idoxifene-treated animals. Adducts were not seen in the control group. These results indicate that <b>idoxifene</b> is as effective a chemopreventive agent as tamoxifen in the rat while causing only very low levels of DNA adducts in liver tissue and suggest that <b>idoxifene</b> may be a well-tolerated chemopreventive agent in women who are at increased risk of breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Background: More efficacious {{and safer}} {{hormonal}} agents {{are needed for}} breast cancer treatment and pre-vention. <b>Idoxifene</b> is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that, in preclinical models, has greater antiestrogenic but lower estrogenic activity than tamoxifen. Patients and methods: Three hundred and twenty-one postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive or-unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either tamoxifen or <b>idoxifene</b> as initial endocrine therapy for advanced disease. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat and all the responses were subject to independent review. Results: At the time of a second planned interim analysis, the trial was stopped for economic considerations, not for reasons related to safety or efficacy. Complete data for the 219 patients included in the second interim analysis are fully available and reported here. Median age was 59. 1 years for <b>idoxifene</b> patients and 59. 9 years for tamoxifen patients. Complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) rates were as follows: tamoxifen, 9 %; <b>idoxifene,</b> 13 % (P = 0. 39). Clinical benefit rate [CR + PR + stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months] was 34. 3 % for <b>idoxifene</b> and 38. 7 % for tamoxifen (P = 0. 31). Median time to progression and duration of response were 140 days and 151. 5 days, respectively, for tamoxifen compared with 166 days and 218 days for <b>idoxifene.</b> None of these endpoints was significantly different for the two drugs, nor was survival.

40|$|<b>Idoxifene</b> {{is a novel}} {{selective}} oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{which had}} greater binding affinity for the oestrogen receptor (ER) and reduced agonist activity compared with tamoxifen in preclinical studies. In a randomized phase II trial in 56 postmenopausal patients with progressive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer we assessed whether <b>idoxifene</b> showed evidence of activity compared with an increased 40 mg/day dose of tamoxifen in patients who had previously demonstrated resistance to the standard 20 mg/day dose of tamoxifen. Of 47 patients eligible for response (25 <b>idoxifene,</b> 22 tamoxifen), two partial responses and two disease stabilizations (SD) for > 6 months were seen with <b>idoxifene</b> (overall clinical benefit rate 16 %, 95 % CI 4. 5 – 36. 1 %). The median duration of clinical benefit was 9. 8 months. In contrast, no objective responses were seen with the increased 40 mg/day dose of tamoxifen, although two patients had SD for 7 and 14 months (clinical benefit rate 9 %, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 29. 2 %). <b>Idoxifene</b> was well tolerated and the reported possible drug-related toxicities were similar in frequency to those with tamoxifen (hot flushes 13 % vs 15 %, mild nausea 20 % vs 15 %). Endocrine and lipid analysis in both groups showed a similar significant fall in serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone after 4 weeks, together with a significant rise in sex hormone binding globulin levels and 11 % reduction in serum cholesterol levels. In conclusion, while <b>idoxifene</b> was associated with only modest evidence of clinical activity in patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, its toxicity profile and effects on endocrine/lipid parameters {{were similar to those}} of tamoxife...|$|E
40|$|Since {{tamoxifen}} is efficacious for {{the prevention}} of second primary breast neoplasms in humans and has a low reported incidence of acute side effects, several structurally related compounds have been developed for the treatment of breast cancer including toremifene and <b>idoxifene.</b> We have compared the karyotypic alterations that occur after a single per os administration of 35 mg/kg of tamoxifen, toremifene or <b>idoxifene</b> to female Sprague-Dawley rats. One day following treatment, the rats were sacrificed and the hepatocytes isolated and cultured. After 47 h in culture, colcemid was added for 3 h prior to harvest of the hepatocytes for karyotypic evaluation. At least 100 metaphase spreads were examined for each of five rats per treatment. Toremifene resulted in aneuploidy in 50 ± 7 % of the cells examined and <b>idoxifene</b> induced a 57 ± 4 % aneuploidy compared with the 85 ± 7 % level induced by tamoxifen. Since the level of aneuploidy in solvent-treated rats was 3 ± 3 %, the induction of aneuploidy in at least 50 % of the cells from rats treated with tamoxifen, toremifene or <b>idoxifene</b> was highly significant. Analysis of electron micrographs of cultures treated with these antiestrogens demonstrated a range of phenotypes including multipolar spindles in toremifene-treated rats and condensed chromo-somes in the presence of an intact nuclear envelope in occasional idoxifene-treated rat hepatocytes. The exclusion of chromosomes from the spindle apparatus and the lagging of some chromosomes on the metaphase plate correlate with the high rate of induction of aneuploidy in the rat liver as determined by karyotypic analysis of hepatocytes from rats treated with these triphenylethylenes...|$|E
40|$|The new anti-estrogens, {{including}} the selective estrogen receptor modulators (e. g., toremifene, droloxifene, <b>idoxifene,</b> raloxifene and arzoxifene), the selective estrogen receptor downregulators (e. g., fulvestrant), {{and the new}} steroidal (e. g., exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole and letrozole) aromatase inhibitors have been investigated {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer and hormonally sensitive tumors of the uterine body. In postmenopausal women, anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane appear to have superior efficacy and an improved toxicity profile than tamoxifen, and fulvestrant seems to be at least as effective as anastrozole in patients in whom tumors have progressed after prior endocrine treatment. Preliminary data showed a high response rate and a favorable toxicity profile for arzoxifene in endometrial cancer, whereas letrozole could represent a new interesting therapeutic tool for endometrial cancer as well as for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether recently developed in vivo high-resolution magnetic resonance-imaging and micro-finite element techniques can monitor changes in bone mechanical properties during long-term clinical trials aiming at evaluating {{the efficacy of}} new drugs {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis. Design. Comparison of baseline and follow-up mechanical parameters calculated using micro-finite element analysis of the calcaneus for subjects participating in a study investigating the effect of <b>idoxifene.</b> Background. Contemporary measurements for the evaluation of bone mechanical properties, based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements, are not very accurate and require large! trial populations. Methods. A total of 56 postmenopausal subjects received either a placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg per day of <b>idoxifene.</b> Magnetic resonance-images of the calcaneus were made at baseline and after one year. Mechanical parameters of a trabecular volume of interest in the calcaneus were calculated using micro-finite element analysis. Results. Although {{there were no significant differences}} between the mean changes in the treated groups and the placebo group, there were significant changes from baseline within groups after one year of treatment. Significant changes, however, were found only for mechanical parameters and only in the treated groups. Conclusions. The present study is the first demonstration that longitudinal changes in bone mechanical properties due to trabecular micro-architectural changes may be quantified in long-term clinical studies. Since significant changes in mechanical parameters were obtained for the treated groups whereas no ! significant change in bone mass was found we conclude that the application of these techniques may increase the clinical significance of these trials. Relevance A precise diagnosis of in vivo bone mechanical properties that accounts for (changes in) trabecular bone architecture is of particular importance for longitudinal clinical trials aiming at evaluating the efficacy of new drugs since it can lead to clinically relevant results from shorter follow-up intervals and may enable a reduction of the number of patients involved in the trial...|$|E

40|$|For many years, {{tamoxifen}} {{has been}} the _gold standard_ amongst anti-oestrogen therapies for breast cancer. However, the selective aro- matase inhibitors (AIs), anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, have demonstrated advantages over tamoxifen as first-line treatments for advanced disease. Anastrozole is also more effective as an adjuvant treatment in early, operable breast cancer and is being increasingly used in the adjuvant setting. Generally, the selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as toremifene, droloxifene, <b>idoxifene,</b> ralox- ifene, and arzoxifene, show minimal activity in tamoxifen-resistant disease and show no superiority over tamoxifen as first-line treatments. In addition to these agents, other treatment options for advanced disease include high-dose oestrogens and progestins. Response rates for high- dose oestrogens and tamoxifen are similar, {{but the use of}} oestrogens is limited by their toxicity profile. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} new endocrine treatment options for breast cancer, particularly for use in disease that is resistant to tamoxifen or AIs. Fulvestrant (_Faslodex_) is a new type of steroidal oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates cellular levels of the ER and progesterone receptor and has no agonist activity. This paper reviews the key efficacy and tolerability data for fulvestrant in postmenopausal women in the context of other endocrine therapies and explores the potential role of fulvestrant within the sequencing of endocrine therapies for advanced breast cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{classify}} selective oestrogen receptor modulators based on gene expression profiles produced in breast cancer cells expressing either wtERα or mutant 351 ERα. In total, 54 microarray experiments were carried out by using a commercially available Atlas cDNA Expression Arrays (Clontech), containing 588 cancer-related genes. Nine sets of data were generated for each cell line following 24 [*]h of treatment: expression data were obtained for cells treated with vehicle EtOH (Control); with 10 − 9 or 10 − 8 [*]M oestradiol; with 10 − 6 [*]M 4 -hydroxytamoxifen; with 10 − 6 [*]M raloxifene; with 10 − 6 [*]M <b>idoxifene,</b> with 10 − 6 [*]M EM 652, with 10 − 6 [*]M GW 7604; with 5 × 10 − 5 [*]M resveratrol and with 10 − 6 [*]M ICI 182, 780. We developed a new algorithm ‘Expression Signatures’ to classify compounds on the basis of differential gene expression profiles. We created dendrograms for each cell line, in which branches represent relationships between compounds. Additionally, clustering analysis was performed using different subsets of genes to assess the robustness of the analysis. In general, only small differences between gene expression profiles treated with compounds were observed with correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 83 to 0. 98. This observation may be explained by the use of the same cell context for treatments with compounds that essentially belong to the same class of drugs with oestrogen receptors related mechanisms. The most surprising observation was that ICI 182, 780 clustered together with oestrodiol and raloxifene for cells expressing wtERα and clustered together with EM 652 for cells expressing mutant 351 ERα. These data provide a rationale for a more precise and elaborate study in which custom made oligonucleotide arrays can be used with comprehensive sets of genes known to have consensus and putative oestrogen response elements in their promoter regions...|$|E
