5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We <b>just</b> <b>went</b> to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really flattered.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which <b>just</b> <b>went</b> over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass went over Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming Dibble and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got {{his head to the}} ball, but it <b>just</b> <b>went</b> over the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, this time in the 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that <b>just</b> <b>went</b> down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

25|$|The {{non-stop}} touring {{was taking}} its toll on the band. By {{the end of the}} New Jersey tour, Bon Jovi had 16 months of concerts under their belt and the band members were exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally.

25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, it was {{reported}} that Fox Broadcasting Company and Sony Pictures were considering a television adaption of the series to be aired on CBS, with Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese writing the script, but with the main actors of the original film likely not returning. The television program was planned to begin in fall, 2012. These plans did not come to fruition. In January 2013, it was revealed that the casting call for the production <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out for the main characters, with a few changes to the movie for the show and the addition of two new characters, Atlanta and Ainsley.|$|E

25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she <b>just</b> <b>went</b> there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Paul Butterfield was out of the {{commercial}} mainstream.

500|$|Jim McCluskey, {{the referee}} of the game, retired {{a year after}} the final and when {{reflecting}} on his time as a referee, mentioned the game was {{one of the highlights of}} his career saying: [...] "It was an unbelievable game of football between two teams who were appearing in their first major cup final and they both <b>just</b> <b>went</b> for it.

[...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Hud was {{conceived}} as an outwardly charming but morally repugnant character, audiences, especially young people, found him likeable, even admirable. Paul Newman said, [...] "We thought [...] last thing people would do was accept Hud as a heroic character...

Martin Ritt later attributed audience {{interpretation of the}} character to the counterculture of the 1960s which [...] "changed the values" [...] of the young audiences who saw Hud as a hero.|$|E
