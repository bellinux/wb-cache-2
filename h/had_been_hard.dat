Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded.

Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E

Hitler wavered, and on 30 July ordered Army Group Centre {{to assume the}} strategic defensive. In Directive 34, he refocused the main effort of Barbarossa on Leningrad because of strong concentrations of enemy forces west of Moscow. To this end, Richthofen and his Fliegerkorps was assigned to Luftflotte 1 (Air Fleet 1). During July 1941, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, or German High Command) displayed a lack of coherent strategy. It shifted from pursuing one objective to the next. It first wanted to advance to Moscow, then Leningrad, before shifting operations further south.|$|E

25|$|Five months later, the two {{met again}} in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were {{involved}} broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum went up and the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade's Arnaud Marchois and BO's Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade {{went on to win}} 14â€“7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to swallow, especially as they had the impression that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side.

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Tutankhamun's mummy, {{there has been a}} lot of speculation and theories on the exact cause of death, which until recent studies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to prove with the evidence and data available. While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread to the general public as popular culture has come up with many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who have devoted a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E

In 1952, an unnumbered road was built from SR81 west-southwest of McDonough to US19/US41/SR3 in Hampton. The next year, a small portion of SR20 {{in the northern part of}} Cartersville, a portion of it west of Canton, and the entire Rockdale County portion were hard surfaced. At this time, SR294N was built, with a hard surface, northeast of Cartersville. At this time, SR20 Conn. was built, from SR20 in Sugar Hill, to US23/SR13 south of Buford. In 1954, the entire Walton County portion of the highway was hard surfaced. SR20 Conn. was redesignated as part of the SR20 mainline. In 1955, it was reverted to being designated as SR20 Conn., with the western part paved. A few years later, all portions of SR20 that had been built were paved. At this time, SR294 had been redesignated as the SR294 mainline. By 1960, SR20 was extended west-southwest from McDonough along SR81, and then on a previously unnumbered road to US19/US41/SR3 in Hampton. The entire length of this extension was paved.|$|E

2500|$|The new mall helped {{take the}} strain off Burbank's troubled economy, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> {{hit by the}} {{departure}} of several large industrial employers, including Lockheed Corp. The center was partially financed with $50 million in city redevelopment funds. Construction had been in doubt for many years by economic woes and political turmoil since it was first proposed in the late 1970s. In 2003, Irvine-based Crown Realty & Development purchased the [...] Burbank Town Center from Pan Pacific Retail Properties for $111 million. Crown then hired General Growth Properties Inc., a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, for property management and leasing duties. At the time, the Burbank mall ranked as the No. 6 retail center in Los Angeles County in terms of leasable square footage, with estimated combined tenant volumes in excess of $240 million. One local standout was the Burbank Town Center's IKEA, with an estimated 30,000 shoppers weekly and rated No. 1 in Southern California with annual sales of $90 million.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1833 and 1836, American {{painter and}} {{putative}} [...] "founder" [...] of The Hudson River School, Thomas Cole, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> {{at work on}} his series of paintings The Course of Empire. The work was commissioned by New York patron Luman Reed, who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested The Course of Empire to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in {{by the end of}} 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on The Course of Empire and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, The Pastoral State. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought [...] "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." [...] Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing: ...|$|E
2500|$|The British opium was {{produced}} in the traditionally cotton-growing regions of India in Bengal and the Ganges River Plain. The East India Company itself neither produced nor shipped opium, but did set the horticultural laws allowing for opium cultivation and actively facilitating the transport of the drug. From Calcutta, the company's [...] "Opium Board" [...] concerned itself with quality control by managing the way opium was packaged and shipped. The board issued licencees to the independent princely states of Malwa, where significant quantities of opium was grown by free or tenant-caste farmers. Both company and Malwan farmlands (traditionally dependent on cotton growing) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> hit {{by the introduction of}} factory-produced cotton cloth, which used cotton grown in Egypt or the American South. Opium was considered a lucrative replacement good, and was auctioned in large amounts at Calcutta. Private merchants who possessed a company charter (to comply with the British royal charter for Asiatic trade) bid on and acquired goods at the Calcutta auction before sailing to Southern China. British ships brought their cargoes to islands off the coast, especially Lintin Island, where Chinese traders with fast and well-armed small boats took the goods inland for distribution, paying for them with silver. The Qing administration initially tolerated opium importation because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, for increasing the silver supply available to foreign merchants through the sale of opium encouraged Europeans to spend more money on Chinese goods. This policy allowed the British to double tea exports from China to England, thereby profiting the Qing monopoly on tea exports held by the imperial treasury and its agents in Canton. However, opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. These factors led to the Qing government issuing an edict against the drug in 1780, followed by an outright ban in 1796, and an order from the governor of Canton to stop the trade in 1799. To circumnavigate the increasingly stringent regulations in Canton, foreign merchants bought older ships and converted them into floating warehouses. These ships were anchored off of the Chinese coast {{at the mouth of the}} Pearl River in case the Chinese authorities moved against the opium trade, as the ships of the Chinese navy had difficulty operating in open water. Inbound opium ships would unload a portion of their cargo at these floating warehouse, where the narcotic was eventually purchased by Chinese opium dealers. By implementing this system of smuggling, foreign merchants could avoid inspection by Chinese officials and prevent retaliation against the trade of their fellow merchants. However, the majority of the opium being traded in Canton prior to 1822 was transported directly upriver to Canton.|$|E
