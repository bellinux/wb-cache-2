40|$|An {{integral}} part of any sample return mission is the initial description and classification of returned samples by the preliminary examination team (PET). The goal of the PET is to characterize and classify returned samples and make this information available to the larger research community who then conduct more in-depth studies on the samples. The PET tries to minimize the impact their work has on the sample suite, which {{has in the past}} limited the PET work to largely visual, nonquantitative measurements (e. g., optical microscopy). More modern techniques can also be utilized by a PET to nondestructively characterize astromaterials in much more rigorous way. Here we discuss our recent investigations into the applications of micro-CT and micro-XRF analyses with Apollo samples and ANSMET meteorites and assess the usefulness of these techniques in future PET. Results: The application of micro computerized tomography (micro-CT) to astromaterials is not a new concept. The technique involves scanning samples with high-energy x-rays and constructing 3 -dimensional images of the density of materials within the sample. The technique can routinely measure large samples (up to approx. 2700 cu cm) with a small individual voxel size (approx. 30 cu m), and has the sensitivity to distinguish the major rock forming minerals and identify clast populations within brecciated samples. We have recently run a test sample of a terrestrial breccia with a carbonate matrix and multiple igneous clast lithologies. The test results are promising and we will soon analyze a approx. 600 <b>g</b> <b>piece</b> of Apollo sample 14321 to map out the clast population within the sample. Benchtop micro x-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) instruments can rapidly scan large areas (approx. 100 sq cm) with a small pixel size (approx. 25 microns) and measure the (semi) quantitative composition of largely unprepared surfaces for all elements between Be and U, often with sensitivity on the order of a approx. 100 ppm. Our recent testing of meteorite and Apollo samples on micro-XRF instruments has shown that they can easily detect small zircons and phosphates (approx. 10 m), distinguish different clast lithologies within breccias, and identify different lithologies within small rock fragments (2 - 4 mm soil Apollo soil fragments) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{equation}} of state (EoS) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at zero temperature can be calculated in two different perturbative regimes: for small values of the baryon chemical potential µ, one may use chiral perturbation theory (ChEFT); and for large values of µ, one may use perturbative QCD (pQCD). Each of these theories is controlled, predictive, and has much theoretical development. There is, however, a gap for µ ∈ (0. 97 GeV, 2. 6 GeV), where these theories becomes non-perturbative, and where there is currently no known microscopic description of QCD matter. Unfortunately, this interval obscures the values of µ found within the cores of neutron stars (NSs). In this thesis, we argue that thermodynamic matching of the ChEFT and pQCD EoSs is a legitimate way to obtain quantitative constraints on the non-pertubative QCD EoS in this intermediate region. Within this framework, one pieces together the EoSs coming from ChEFT (or another low-energy description) and pQCD in a thermodynamically consistent manner to obtain a band of allowed EoSs. This method trades qualitative modeling for quantitative constraints: one attempts no microscopic characterization of the underlying matter. In this thesis, we argue that this method is an effective, verifiable, and systematically improvable way to explore and characterize the interior of NSs. First, we carry out a simplified matching procedure in QCD-like theories that can be simulated on the lattice without a sign problem. Our calculated pressure band serves as a prediction for lattice-QCD practitioners and {{will allow them to}} verify or refute the simplified procedure. Second, we apply the state-of-the-art matched EoS of Kurkela et al. (2014) to rotating NSs. This allows us to obtain bounds on observable NS properties, as well as point towards future observations that would more tightly constrain the current state-of-the-art EoS band. Finally, as evidence of the ability to improve the procedure, we carry out calculations in pQCD to improve the zero-temperature pressure. We calculate the full O(g 6 ln 2 g) contribution to the pQCD pressure for nf massless quarks, as well as {{a significant portion of the}} O(g 6 ln <b>g)</b> <b>piece</b> and even some of the O(g 6) piece...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Microwave heating {{of foods}} offers rapid and {{flexible}} heating both for consumer and industrial applications, with several advantages, such as reduced processing time (due to volumetric heating and reduced coming-up times (heating {{time required to}} reach the desired target temperature), selective heating, increased process flexibility and efficient heating (volumetric heating of the food does not require heating of a surrounding medium or package). However, successful installations require knowledge in process design. Modelling {{could be used to}} accomplish this in a way that gives the desired electromagnetic field distribution. The resulting microwave heating pattern depends in a complex way on a large number of parameters, related to the food, the package as well as the oven. Among these parameters are: food dimensions and geometry, dielectric and thermo-physical properties of the food, design and geometry of the food package, placement of food components and design of the oven. This thesis deals with selected applications of microwave heating of foods at 2450 MHz, modelling of microwave heating of foods in a lab-scale microwave oven, and the evaluation of continuous tubular microwave heating of foods in pilot-scale, in terms of temperature uniformity in a homogeneous model food and with respect to rapidness in heating of a particulate model food and its resulting product quality. Additionally, an accurate method for determining the dielectric properties of liquids is described. Dielectric properties of foods are required as input data for modelling of microwave heating, and also serve as a first basis for understanding the phenomena behind microwave heating of foods. In the food industry, process operations often require continuous processes, due to the desired high yield. This suggests a large potential for well-designed and controlled microwave continuous operations. High-temperature short-time (HTST) processing of foods could be used to achieve thermal processing as sterilisation, while exposing foods to heating for a shorter time than conventional heat treatment, with resulting minimal product degradation. It is suggested that continuous tubular microwave heating of particulate foods could offer an alternative to HTST processing for producing high-quality particulate foods with increased rapidness due to the volumetric microwave heating and the shorter coming-up times to achieve the necessary target temperature. The work presented in part of this thesis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} achieve microwave-assisted HTST conditions in terms of continuous tubular microwave heating of a high-concentrated particulate model food product for a 12 mm tubular system at 2450 MHz. This is accomplished by combining modes that heat primarily in the centre (TM 020) and in the periphery (TM 120) of the tube. This process results in a more rapid and uniform heating where the product (particulates as well as the surrounding continuous phase) will reach the desired target temperature more rapidly (than in a traditional HTST system), with resulting reduced losses in product quality in terms of e. <b>g.</b> <b>piece</b> integrity. Additionally,microwave HTST processing offers product quality advantages due to reduced overheating of the continuous phase and also large process flexibility, since a wide interval of possible combinations of target temperature and holding time is accomplished in the same equipment. Moreover, combined centre and periphery heating is shown to give a more uniform temperature distribution, than periphery alone or centre alone heating could offer, in the 16 mm tubular microwave system. Furthermore, modelling of heating of foods in a microwave combination oven at 2450 MHz, in which the food is heated by combined microwave and convective heating, is described by solving for the electromagnetic fields in a model food load and then including these as a source term in a heat transfer model. Validation experiments of the numerical model showed good qualitative and quantitative agreement. Computers today are considerably faster than 10 - 15 years ago, which contributes to increased use of modelling tools for process design and development of optimised industrial microwave heating systems. It is suggested that this has contributed to increase the number of successful installations in food industry and will continue to support the steadily growing trend of industrial installations in the years to come...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} method for synthesizing rigid-body acceleration noise for complex multibody scenes. Existing acceleration noise synthesis methods for animation require object-specific precomputation, which is prohibitively expensive for scenes involving rigid-body fracture or {{other sources of}} small, procedurally generated debris. We avoid precomputation by introducing a proxy-based method for acceleration noise synthesis in which precomputed acceleration noise data is only generated for a small set of ellipsoidal proxies and stored in a proxy soundbank. Our proxy model is shown to be effective at approximating acceleration noise from scenes with lots of small debris (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>pieces</b> produced by rigid-body fracture). This approach is not suitable for synthesizing acceleration noise from larger objects with complicated non-convex geometry; however, {{it has been shown}} in previous work that acceleration noise from objects such as these tends to be largely masked by modal vibration sound.

This study aimed at evaluating the state of lipid oxidation of irradiated sausages. Its findings could help the control, improve food safety and quality properties to food industries.

Cooking loss was lower in OO samples than SS samples. With increased pressure to 600 MPa, the oleic acid content of OO samples increased. The total unsaturated fatty acids were the highest in SO and OO 600 MPa samples. Lipid oxidation was retarded by addition of olive oil combined with HP. The addition of olive oil and soy sauce followed by HP decreased the amount of volatile basic nitrogen during storage and reduced the population of pathogens. Sensory evaluation indicated that the addition of olive oil enhanced the overall acceptance and willingness to buy. In conclusion, the combination of HP with the addition of soy sauce and/or olive oil is an effective technology that can improve chemical, health, sensory qualities and safety of chicken breast.

40|$|Sea birds play a {{major role}} in marine food webs, and it is {{important}} to determine when and how much they feed at sea. A major advance has been made by using the drop in stomach temperature after ingestion of ectothermic prey. This method is less sensitive when birds eat small prey or when the stomach is full. Moreover, in diving birds, independently of food ingestion, there are fluctuations in the lower abdominal temperature during the dives. Using oesophageal temperature, we present here a new method for detecting the timing of prey ingestion in free-ranging sea birds, and, to our knowledge, report the first data obtained on king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). In birds ashore, which were hand-fed 2 - 15 <b>g</b> <b>pieces</b> of fish, all meal ingestions were detected with a sensor in the upper oesophagus. Detection was poorer with sensors at increasing distances from the beak. At sea, slow temperature drops in the upper oesophagus and stomach characterized a diving effect per se.

Combining the changes in oesophageal temperatures of marine predators with their diving pattern opens new perspectives for understanding their foraging strategy, and, after validation with concurrent applications of classical techniques of prey survey, for assessing the distribution of their prey...|$|R
