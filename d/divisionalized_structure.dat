An implicit assumption made in the literature dealing with multimarket contact and collusion in infinitely repeated games is the existence of a single decision taker. Nevertheless, big firms often hand over responsibility for single markets to managers, who maximize divisional profits. If markets were independent from each other, the impact of multimarket contact would vanish. In this paper, the consequences of divisionalization on the sustainability of are analyzed in a two-firm two-market framework with intra-firm scope effects. Within a <b>divisionalized</b> <b>structure,</b> each manager chooses the output of his market to maximize long-term divisional profits. Managers do not coordinate their collusion or deviation decisions. It is shown, that-dependent on the kind of scope effects- the lack of coordination between divisions may increase or decrease the collusive power of firms. If firms face economies of scope, collusion is easier to sustain within a <b>divisionalized</b> <b>structure,</b> whereas firms facing diseconomies of scope prefer centralized decision making and coordination of collusio...|$|E
40|$|Business {{historians and}} theorists of {{organization}} have portrayed the divisionalized (M-form) organization {{as a response}} to the problems posed by diversity and, to a lesser extent, size. Assuming a drift towards optimal forms of organization, this implies that there should be a cross-sectional association between diversity, size and the incidence of the divisionalized form. This paper presents data from a survey of large UK companies which is only partly consistent with these expectations. The more diverse companies tend to be organised either in the divisionalized or the holding company form, whilst there is no size effect in the sense that divisionalized companies tend to be larger than the rest. There are size effects, however, on particular aspects of divisionalization. First, companies with levels of organization intermediate between their business units and headquarters tend to be larger than those which do not. Second, amongst companies without intermediate levels, size is associated with the reporting against target of profitability at business-unit level. This suggests that the introduction of intermediate levels or profitability targets might be alternatives in the earlier stages of company growth. With the exception of earlier work by Marginson (1985, 1988), the possible relevance of the <b>divisionalized</b> <b>structure</b> to the control of labour has been ignored. Marginson found some evidence that the M-form organization was associated with a raising of the bargaining level to that of the division {{as a response to}} the plant-level trade union strength during the 1960 s and 1970 s. In the present era of comparative trade-union weakness, this paper argues that the <b>divisionalized</b> <b>structure</b> offers a means of maintaining outline control of a devolved bargaining process which is able to adapt to local contingencies. Partly consistent with this expectation, our data show that the M-form company is associated with a devolution of pay bargaining to the level of the individual establishment, although this is also true of the H-form. Consistent with the argument from trade-union weakness, this is a relatively recent development. In M-form and H-form companies, devolved bargaining tends to be accompanied by genuine managerial autonomy on pay issues. In other forms of organization, establishment-level bargaining occurs within the framework of tight headquarters control, so that the devolution is more apparent than real...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the organization of planning activities in large organization. Planning is an essential activity that must be carried out by all organizations if they are to continue to exist in the real, unstatic world. However, the organization of planning may take many different forms, from the use of large centralized planning units to a largely informal, unspecialized activity carried out at many organizational levels. The main thesis of this paper is that there exist particular definable and qualitatively measurable factors that determine in any particular case the organization of planning that will be most suitable. The center of interest here is on problems which are peculiar to <b>divisionalized</b> <b>structures,</b> in which each division has a planning function which feeds into a planning function for the corporate whole. It is hypothesized that where the situations facing each of the divisions would lead naturally to the adoption of different forms of planning, pressures exist forcing them towards similar forms. In this circumstance {{one or more of the}} divisions will find itself with a poorly adapted system. At the corporate level difficult trade-offs will need to be made between maladaptation in one part of the organization as against some other part. Much of the paper {{is concerned with}} discussion of a theoretical nature characterizing different ways of organizing planning and the factors determining the suitability of one mode rather than another. However, the ideas are tested against the experiences gained from study of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The field work on the TVA was carried out by a team of IIASA scientists during 1975. The study was a wide ranging one covering management practices, strategy formulation, planning, use of models, environmental management and organization structure. The information used here draws especially on the findings of study related to organization structure and planning...|$|R
40|$|Background and problem: Divisionalized firms {{often use}} {{transfer}} pricing {{as a means}} of controlling and evaluating separate units. Since transfer pricing creates an economic relationship between units and accounting information of the unitâ€™s performance, transfer pricing is argued to have an effect on accountability. Such research is however limited, to which a possible explanation is the institutionalization of transfer pricing as an organizational everyday practice. As technology and availability develop, the expectations on accountability increase which creates a desire to resume research on transfer pricings effect on accountability. Aim of the study: The study investigates what impact transfer pricing has on various accountability demands and how it might affect the conflict between them. Methodology: A qualitative case study was performed at the Atlas Copco group, a company with a complex and <b>divisionalized</b> organizational <b>structure</b> with emphasis on their internal transactions. In-depth interviews were the primary source of data. The data analysis was performed using the analytical model developed and presented in the theoretical framework. Discussion and Conclusion: The current principles of the transfer pricing system cause a conflict in terms of viewing the relationship between internal service providers and their customers different were one unit considers the lateral/social accountability as dominant while the other considers the hierarchical accountability as prominent in the relationship. This causes uncertainties for the parties on how to act towards each other and which accounts should be given and demanded. It also opens up possibilities for sub-optimization in terms of a misdirected focus and not taking responsibility, but also in terms of de-motivating managers. The study also concluded that this conflict lead to a change in the object of accountability. MSc in Accountin...|$|R
