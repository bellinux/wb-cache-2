25|$|Because {{the roof}} of the Froghall tunnel has always been {{extremely}} low, the 2003 restoration included lowering the water level in the pound after dredging, and thus the headroom in the tunnel was improved to 5ft (1.52m) with a beam of 6ft 8ins (2.03m). Unfortunately the new moorings just past the tunnel remain relatively little used, as many modern boats are still too high to pass through the tunnel. A <b>height</b> <b>profile</b> gauge is located at the exit of Flintmill Lock 17 to indicate if a boat has sufficient clearance to pass through the tunnel. The low height restriction would similarly affect proposals to reopen stretches of the Uttoxeter Canal to boating.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} robust geometry optimisation of railway crossings is presented. The robustness {{is achieved by}} optimising the crossing geometry for a representative set of wheel profiles. As {{a basis for the}} optimisation, a crossing geometry is created where rail cross-sectional <b>profiles</b> and longitudinal <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> of both wing rails and crossing nose are parameterised. Based on the approximation that the two problems are decoupled, separate optimisations are performed for the cross-sectional rail profiles and the longitudinal <b>height</b> <b>profiles.</b> The rail cross sections are optimised to minimise the maximum Hertzian wheel-rail contact pressure. The longitudinal <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> are optimised to minimise the accumulated damage in the wing rail to crossing nose transition zone. The accumulated damage is approximated using an objective criterion that accounts for the angle of the wheel trajectory reversal during the transition from the wing rail to the crossing nose as well as the distribution of transition points for the utilised wheel profile set. It is found that small nonlinear height deviations from a linear longitudinal wing rail profile in the transition zone can reduce the objective compared to the nominal design. It is further demonstrated that the variation in wheel profile shapes, lateral wheel displacements and the feasible transition zone length of the crossing will determine the longitudinal <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> of the wing rail and crossing nose if all wheel profiles are to make their transition within the transition zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{along-track}} {{analysis of}} temperature <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> {{measured by the}} CRISTA satellite instrument was performed to obtain <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> of absolute values of gravity wave momentum flux. Global distributions of momentum flux from CRISTA are compared to results of the Warner and McIntyre gravity wave parameterization scheme. Only a limited range of horizontal and vertical wavelengths is visible to the CRISTA instrument. Therefore the model results have to be filtered accordingly to make comparisons meaningful. We demonstrate the importance of such a wavelength filtering which significantly increases the correlation of observed and modeled momentum fluxes. (c) 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|As {{the output}} signal after the {{pre-processing}} of sensor signals with a laser scanner and light-section sensor, the so-called <b>height</b> <b>profile</b> of the measured groove geometry is achieved. It represents {{the surface of}} the workpiece along the section at the projected laser line.3 D measuring systems with active illumination are mainly using the light-section method in combination with the projection of several parallel laser lines. In doing so, each line generates a <b>height</b> <b>profile.</b> Through the arrangement of several lines along the weld groove, a further dimension is achieved which shows the change of the height profiles of the groove geometry. Through the number of the lines, the resolution in groove longitudinal direction is increasing, however, the data processing expenditure is also increasing. Similar to the projection of several parallel lines, the measurement via a projected circle or other geometrical figures on the workpiece surface is possible.|$|E

As a model sample, the row-wise anti-ferromagnetic Mn 3 N 2 (010) surface is studied. It is shown that the magnetic contrast in atomic-scale images is a strong function of the bias voltage around the Fermi level. Inversion of the magnetic contrast is also demonstrated. The experimental SP-STM images and <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> are compared with simulated SP-STM images and <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> based on spin-polarized density functional theory.

The section to Scheidt (Saar) runs almost level, but from the eastern end of St. Ingbert station it rises more steeply with a maximum climb of 1.05% until it reaches its first crest of about 272 m a.s.l. in a deep cutting between Rohrbach (Saar) and Kirkel (both at ca. 258 m a.s.l.).

40|$|Strong gyres and jets can be {{generated}} at auroral latitudes in the thermosphere by enhanced electric fields during geomagnetic substorms. Typical <b>height</b> <b>profiles</b> of ion density suggest that the ion drag force should generate large curvature in the vertical profile of the winds in the highly viscous region of the thermosphere above about 200 km.

Analytic and numerical calculations of the ageostrophic winds forced by curvature in model geostrophic wind profiles show that the ageostrophic wind speeds and directions depend mainly on the kinematic viscosity {{in the region of}} curvature and the total change in shear in the geostrophic wind.
