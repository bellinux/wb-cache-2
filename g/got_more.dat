5|$|The {{plan was}} to begin again in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan. The People's Republic of China {{announced that it would}} not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country <b>got</b> <b>more</b> than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg <b>got</b> <b>more</b> ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{generated}} significant controversy. Former Governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who is referenced {{briefly in}} the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. Andrea Fay Friedman, who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator Seth MacFarlane, who defended the episode, and was also supported by Bill Maher, the host of Real Time. The episode <b>got</b> <b>more</b> criticism from the Parents Television Council during its original broadcast.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{mounted a}} third attack {{late in the}} afternoon, around 3:00. Several times German {{soldiers}} attempted to penetrate the American lines. The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill. At one point PFC Milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already dead. As mortar fire on his position <b>got</b> <b>more</b> accurate, Milsovech noticed a pistol on the supposed medic's belt, and decided he must be calling in fire on their position. He shot and killed him. Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more, seeking reinforcements. At 3:50, Fort sent the unit's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen. He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75, who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest.|$|E
