5|$|In 694, Ine {{extracted}} {{compensation of}} 30,000 pence from the Kentishmen {{for the death}} of Mul; this amount represented the value of an aetheling's life in the Saxon system of Weregild. Ine appears to <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> control of Surrey, but did not recover Kent. No king of Wessex was to venture so far east until Egbert, over a hundred years later.|$|E

50|$|Mount St Mary's Convent (Goldicott) <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> a {{considerable}} proportion {{of its original}} grounds which allow the house to remain remote {{in the midst of}} extensive development. This is a rare example of an 1880s house in Toowong which <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> substantial grounds and outlook.|$|R

5|$|Mangalorean Catholics {{speak the}} Konkani {{language}}, which they <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> as their mother tongue despite the migration; {{the language is}} central to the community's identity. They speak a dialect known as Mangalorean Catholic Konkani, which the Ethnologue broadly identifies as the Mangalore dialect.|$|E
5|$|The North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Council, meanwhile, have {{announced}} that they <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> the services of Squire Patton Boggs to lobby the U.S. Congress {{to take action to}} ensure that Greek-letter organizations are protected from future accusations of the kind leveled in Erdely's article.|$|E

5|$|Very little {{information}} exists about the education given to Przemysł II. Diplomatic sources <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> only {{the names of}} two of his teachers: Dragomir and Przybysław. It is assumed (although without any direct evidence) that the prince had some knowledge of at least Latin in speech and writing.|$|E
5|$|While much of Old Coast Road {{was renamed}} Forrest Highway in 2014, {{bypassed}} {{sections of the}} former Perth Bunbury Highway near Mandurah and Australind <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> the name Old Coast Road, and have significance as part of numbered road routes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> three spires.|$|E

5|$|At {{its first}} screening, {{the film was}} well {{received}} by critics and the public, and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela. Given the theme of leprosy, the film was criticized by some who believed {{it would have a}} negative impact on the image of Colombia.

5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> its traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced {{to the level of}} infraorder.|$|E
5|$|Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran {{remained}} with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship {{of it to}} John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> some level of physical posession, {{regardless of whether they}} any legal authority to do so. The status of Rùm during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not mention it as part of Hugh's possessions.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Hebrides {{as a whole}} were {{a strong}} Scottish Gaelic-speaking area, and in 1921 more than 50% of the populations of most of these islands, {{including}} Skye, Mull and Islay, were proficient in the language. However, although the Outer Hebrides <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> many Gaelic speakers, in the 2001 census only Skye (31%) and Tiree (48%) had more than 25% of the resident population able to speak Gaelic; Mull, Jura, Gigha and Coll each recorded figures of less than 15%.|$|E
5|$|Milan and Barcelona {{share the}} record for the most victories, each having won the {{competition}} five times since its inception. Two of Milan's wins were achieved in consecutive years (1989 and 1990), which makes them the only team to <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> the UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona have the most appearances (nine) and also the most runner-up finishes (four). Spanish teams have won the competition the most times, with thirteen wins, ahead of the nine wins by Italian teams. The current holders are Real Madrid, who beat 2016–17 UEFA Europa League winners Manchester United 2–1 in the 2017 edition.|$|E
5|$|Most of the convents of {{the town}} have disappeared; the Dominican convent {{is the only one}} to <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> much of its {{original}} appearance. It was built in the 13th century and still has its church and cloister. The Franciscan convent was completely destroyed, apart from the choir of its church, which now serves as a Protestant church. Sélestat also has an old granary that belonged to the Benedictine priory, and a 16th-century commandery built by the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E

5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes may <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> some slight {{parallel to}} social divisions within Roman society, {{but at least}} officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E
5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits <b>have</b> <b>retained</b> this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
