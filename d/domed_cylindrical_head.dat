50|$|Berkeley Square Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located in Saranac Lake (Harrietstown) in Franklin County, New York. It consists of 22 contributing buildings; the 1926-28 Harrietstown Town Hall and 21 commercial buildings constructed between 1867 and 1932. Most of the buildings are three stories with cornices. Styles range {{from a group of}} three Second Empire style structures dated to the late-1860s-early 1870s, late 19th century business blocks, and early 20th century buildings reflecting the various revival styles of that period.

50|$|This {{species is}} of the Acacia genus with the {{specific}} species name being brachystachya. The plant is called brachystachya due to its short spikes, brachys (short), and stachys (spike). Acacia brachystachya is classed as a group 1 Acacia under the informal groupings outlined by D.A Morrison and S.J Davies. Group 1 plants are identified as having phyllodes, {{as well as being}} the only group which features flowers in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} is novel compared with previous works, {{in the following}} three respects. First, self-occlusion of the input face is detected automatically by estimating the head pose using a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head</b> model. Second, a 3 D model fitting scheme is designed based on selected visible facial feature points, which facilitates 3 D face reconstruction without any effect from self-occlusion. Third, the reconstruction performance is enhanced by using the estimated pose as the initial pose parameter during the 3 D model fitting process.|$|R

There is also tradition of producing textile art, [...] The culture from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive buildings than sculpture, but the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds appear {{to have had a}} special significance and were presumably mounted on monoliths.

50|$|The term flail {{refers to}} two {{different}} weapons: a long, two-handed infantry weapon with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head,</b> and a shorter weapon {{with a round}} metal striking head. The defining characteristic of both is that they involve a separate striking head attached to a handle by a flexible rope, strap, or chain. The chief tactical virtue of the flail was its capacity to strike around a defender's shield or parry. Its chief liability {{was a lack of}} precision and the difficulty of using it in close combat, or closely ranked formations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{simple system}} flute had a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head</b> joint and a reverse tapered body. The six main tone holes were heavily {{undercut}} to produce even intonation and registration while providing even finger spacing. French simple system flutes (or [...] "five-key flutes") from this era typically had five keys that enabled the flute {{to play in}} any key. English and German models were typically designed with eight keys: the five of the five-key flute, plus an alternate F key running along the instrument, and two keys on the foot joint to extend the lower register down to middle C.|$|R
40|$|Silo 3, a freestanding, {{pre-stressed}} concrete, <b>domed</b> <b>cylindrical</b> tank, {{located at}} the Fernald Closure Project near Cincinnati, Ohio, contains approximately 5, 100 cubic yards of metal oxide waste generated from Fernald operations that extracted uranium from ore material. The baseline for the Silo 3 Project is to remove a portion of this material from the silo pneumatically by inserting vacuum retrieval wands and/or hoses in existing manways on the silo dome. After the loose material has been removed by the pneumatic system, the project intends to cut {{an opening in the}} silo wall and use a mechanical excavator to complete removal of the remaining material, including possible combination with pneumatic retrieval. Fluor Fernald previously requested that the Department of Energy Environmental Management Office of Science and Technology provide a Technical Assistance Team to review this approach. One of the key recommendations made by this team was to assess the wand operability, effectiveness, reliability, and safety in a mock-up test. A team was convened to develop the test plan, build the demonstration test loop, and perform the tests. The tests focused primarily on the operability of the system, and to a significantly lesser extent process performance. This report documents the results for the testing completed in April 2003. Based upon the testing performed, the team identified several key issues to be incorporated into the design and operation of the retrieval system...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{configuration}} of facial features and the timing of facial actions are important to emotion and communication. Previous literature {{has focused on the}} former. We developed an automatic facial expression analysis system that quantifies the timing of facial actions as well as head and eye motion during spontaneous facial expression. To assess coherence among these modalities, we recorded and analyzed spontaneous smiles in 62 young women of varied ethnicity ranging in age from 18 to 35 years. Spontaneous smiles occurred following directed facial action tasks, a situation likely to elicit spontaneous smiles of embarrassment. Smiles (AU 12) were manually FACS coded by certified FACS coders. 3 D head motion was recovered using a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head</b> model; motio...|$|R

The body of the radius is self-explanatory, and the lower extremity of the radius is roughly quadrilateral in shape, with articular surfaces for the ulna, scaphoid and lunate bones. The distal end of the radius forms two palpable points, radially the styloid process and Lister's tubercle on the ulnar side. Along with the proximal and distal radioulnar articulations, an interosseous membrane originates medially {{along the length of}} the body of the radius to attach the radius to the ulna.|$|R
50|$|A {{thumb tack}} has two basic {{components:}} the head, often made of plastic, metal or wood, and the body, usually {{made of steel}} or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the tack in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, <b>domed,</b> spherical, <b>cylindrical</b> {{and a variety of}} novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Thumb tack heads also {{come in a variety of}} colors. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some thumb tack designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a tack.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Tretherick faced quickly about. Standing in {{the doorway}} {{was a little girl}} of six or seven. Her dress had been {{originally}} fine, but was torn and dirty; and her hair, which was a very violent red, was tumbled serio-comically about her forehead. For all this, she was a picturesque little thing, even through whose childish timidity there was a certain self-sustained air which is apt to come upon children who are left much to themselves. She was holding under her arm a rag doll, apparently of her own workmanship, and nearly as large as herself,--a doll with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>head,</b> and features roughly indicated with charcoal. A long shawl, evidently belonging to a grown person, dropped from her shoulders, and swept the floor.|$|R
