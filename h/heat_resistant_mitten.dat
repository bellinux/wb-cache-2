The results show that these three <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> foams have higher glass transition temperatures (close to 100 &# 176;C) than universal structural foam (83. 2 &# 176;C). Compared with the universal structural foam, the three <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> foams show much higher decomposition temperature and better chemical stability due to the crosslinking of PVC macromolecular chains. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) values of the three <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> foam plastics are just a little {{higher than that of}} universal structural foam. The three <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> foam plastics have good dimensional stability at 140 &# 176;C, and when used as core material can closely adhere to the face plates in medium temperature curing processes. Compared with universal structural foam, the three <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> foam plastics have slightly better mechanical properties...|$|R

This study aimed at detecting and identifying <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> molds during the processing of apple nectar (pH 3. 4; 11. 6 °Brix) in order to select the most <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> mold. The isolation was carried out after heat shock at 70 °C, during 2 hours, and incubation at 30 °C, in PDA (3 % agar), where rose bengal was added. The identification of macro and microscopic structures was carried out after incubation in three different media (G 25 N, CYA, MEA) and temperatures. Different heat shocks, from 80 °C/ 20 minutes to 97 °C/ 15 minutes, were applied to select the most <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> mold. Eleven strains were selected, of which five were heat-resistant: three strains were isolated from apple and concentrated apple juice and were identified as Neosartorya fischeri; one strain, isolated from apple, was identified as Byssochlamys fulva and one strain, isolated from the product after the first pasteurization, was identified as Eupenicillium sp. The most heat-resistant strains belong to N. fischeri and B. fulva, which were able to survive at 95 °C/ 20 minutes.

40|$|Bacterial {{endospore}} formers {{can produce}} spores that {{are resistant to}} many food processing conditions, including heat. Some spores may survive heating processes aimed at production of commercially sterile foods. Recently, it was shown that a spoVA operon, designated spoVA 2 mob, present on a Tn 1546 transposon in Bacillus subtilis, leads to profoundly increased wet heat resistance of B. subtilis spores. Such Tn 1546 transposon elements including the spoVA 2 mob operon were also found in several strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus licheniformis, and these strains were shown to produce spores with significantly higher resistances to wet heat than their counterparts lacking this transposon. In this study, the locations and compositions of Tn 1546 transposons encompassing the spoVA 2 mob operons in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis were analyzed. Introduction of these spoVA 2 mob operons into B. subtilis 168 (producing spores that are not highly <b>heat</b> <b>resistant)</b> rendered mutant 168 strains that produced high-level <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> spores, demonstrating that these elements in B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis are responsible for high level heat resistance of spores. Assessment of growth of the nine strains of each species between 5. 2 °C and 57. 7 °C showed some differences between strains, especially at lower temperatures, but all strains were able to grow at 57. 7 °C. Strains of B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis that contain the Tn 1546 elements (and produce high-level <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> spores) grew at temperatures {{similar to those of}} their Tn 1546 -negative counterparts that produce low-level <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> spores.

40|$|Alloy {{design by}} the {{traditional}} trial and error approach {{is known to be}} a time consuming and a highly cost procedure, especially for the design of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steel where the feedback time is intrinsically long. The significant developments in computational simulation techniques in the last decades have made a theory-guided computational alloy design possible. Such a computational approach can substantially decrease the development time costs. In this thesis a computational alloy design approach coupling thermodynamics, kinetics and a genetic algorithm has been developed to design the non-corroding ferritic, martensitic and austenitic <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels for use at a high service temperature. In the design of <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels, the evolution of the microstructure and hence properties, depends on service time and temperature and should be considered carefully. For <b>heat</b> <b>resistant</b> steels deriving part of their high strength on precipitates the coarsening of the precipitates at high temperature is considered as the most important factor and this process features highly in the design. Novel steel compositions (involving typically 9 alloying elements) and associated key heat treatment parameters are considered and optimised. The calculated optimal compositions are unlikely to be perfect and free of experimental problems but form an excellent start to initiate experimental development programs and to substantially shorten the development time of new high performance steel grades.
