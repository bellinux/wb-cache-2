5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, {{a space station}} located near a stable {{wormhole}} between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) plays a 1960s secret agent alongside Garak (Andrew Robinson) in a holosuite. After a transporter accident makes several other crew members appear as characters in the program, the duo must prevent any of them from dying in the game or <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will be killed in real life.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E

How <b>else</b> could <b>they</b> have sat around and protested? What <b>else</b> would <b>they</b> have cried and written about? Without the folk, life would not have been life for them." ...|$|R

5|$|Bashir is {{startled to}} see Kira appear as a Russian spy, who {{introduces}} herself as Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. She has no idea who Major Kira is. Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die or <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will lose the patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in the shrinking of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or <b>else</b> <b>they</b> might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or <b>else</b> <b>they</b> would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone <b>else.</b> <b>They</b> encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{can occur}} if {{the loyalty of}} a {{particular}} province falls too low, with a rebel army appearing in the province to attempt to assume control from the owners. Civil wars may also take place if several generals commanding large armies have sufficiently low loyalty. In {{the event of a}} civil war, the player is given the choice to back either the current rulers or the rebels. It had been planned to allow other factions who had established a prior claim to the throne by marriage to princesses to join in a civil war to claim the throne for themselves; however, this was never implemented. Naval warfare is carried out upon the campaign map, where ships can be built and organised into fleets. These fleets can be used to control the game's sea regions and form sea lanes, allowing trade and troop movement between provinces that have constructed a port. Fleets can engage in sea battles with foreign fleets, although unlike land battles these are resolved by the computer. Religion plays an important aspect in Medieval: Total War, with religious differences between the Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim factions affecting diplomacy and population loyalty. Catholic factions must also respond to the wishes of the Papal States; factions gain favour by refraining from hostilities with other Catholic nations and responding to Crusades, <b>else</b> <b>they</b> run the risk of excommunication. The option to launch a holy war {{in the form of a}} Crusade or Jihad is open to both Catholic and Muslim factions.|$|E

25|$|Cape St. Vincent {{was already}} sacred ground in Neolithic times, as {{standing}} menhirs {{in the neighborhood}} attest.

25|$|During {{the last}} ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques within the Muslim {{community}} will host Iʿtikāf, a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate.

As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever <b>else</b> <b>they</b> need during their stay.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} {{was able to}} summon {{a large amount of}} public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work.
