40|$|International audienceDetermining the {{direction}} normal to the magnetopause layer {{is a key}} step for any study of this boundary. Various techniques {{have been developed for}} this purpose. We focus here on generic residue analysis (GRA) methods, which are based on conservation laws, and the new iterative BV method, where B represents the magnetic field and V refers to the ion velocity. This method relies on a fit of the magnetic field <b>hodogram</b> against a modeled geometrical shape and on the way this <b>hodogram</b> is described in time. These two methods have different underlying model assumptions and validity ranges. We compare here magnetopause normals predicted by BV and GRA methods to better understand the sensitivity of each method on small departures from its own physical hypotheses. This comparison is carried out first on artificial data with magnetopause-like noise. Then a statistical study is carried out using a list of 149 flank and dayside magnetopause crossings from Cluster data where the BV method is applicable, i. e., where the magnetopause involves a single-layer current sheet, with a crudely C-shaped magnetic <b>hodogram.</b> These two comparisons validate the quality of the BV method for all these cases where it is applicable. The method provides quite reliable normal directions in all these cases, even when the boundary is moving with a varying velocity, which distorts noticeably the results of most of the other methods...|$|E

40|$|ISEE 1 and 2 {{magnetic}} field data obtained during dayside magnetopause crossings are analyzed using a minimum variance technique {{in order to}} determine the characteristics of the rotation of the {{magnetic field}} across the magnetopause. Only a small fraction of the magnetopause crossings examined present a sufficiently coherent structure that they can be compared with theoretical predictions and only a few of the <b>hodograms</b> of the magnetic field at the crossings display the ideal rotation expected for a rotational discontinuity structure. It is found that the observed senses of rotation are not consistent with the predictions of the electron whistler polarization theory. Rotations exceeding 180 deg are very seldom observed; they usually occur across multiple crossings, either as 360 deg rotation about the minimum variance direction or, occasionally, in more complicated patterns associated with S-shaped <b>hodograms.</b> These observations are seen as indicating that the sense of the magnetic field rotation through the magnetopause is controlled by the relative orientation of the magnetosheath and the magnetospheric field and that the angular rotation is minimized when the magnetic field changes from one orientation to the other...|$|R

An extensive parameter variation is carried out, with particular emphasis on beta, Ti/Te, theta sub B (the angle between the normal and total magnetic field), and the helicity of the RD. The RD structure is shown to have features {{in common with the}} evolution of both strongly modulated nonlinear wave packets and linear dispersive wave propagation in oblique magnetic fields. For small theta sub B, the RD disperses linearly, giving fast and Alfven waves upstream and downstream, respectively, and the familiar S-shaped <b>hodograms.</b> At larger theta sub B, nonlinearity becomes important and strong coupling to a compressional (sonic) component can occur in the main current layer.

Field rotations varying from about 80 to 120 deg were involved in the transition from the magnetosheath to the magnetosphere, and <b>hodograms</b> of the tangential component of the magnetic field vector suggest that the magnetopause was a rotational discontinuity.

The methods used are the <b>hodogram</b> analysis, the minimum variance matrix analysis and the cohenrence analysis. The minimum variance analysis gives evidence of linear polarized wave modes.

In general, {{there is a strong}} correlation between the overall quality of seismoelectric data {{and the quality of the}} associated seismic data. Factors like the electrical resistivity or electrode coupling are less significant. A strong dependence of the seismoelectric signals on the pH value could be shown with borehole seismoelectric measurements.

The <b>hodogram</b> of magnetic field oscillations rotated counterclockwise at GOES 8, and clockwise at GOES 10. It is suggested that the satellites detected the waves generated by the substorm injected clouds of the charged particles drifting in the magnetosphere in the opposite azimuthal directions: GOES 8 (located east of the substorm onset) detected the wave generated by an electron cloud, and GOES 10 (west of the onset) detected the wave generated by a positive ion cloud.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of shear wave-arrivals above small earthquakes makes the polarisations and time-delays of shear-wave splitting above small earthquakes difficult to measure. We report a semi-automatic shear-wave analysis system, SWAS, {{that appears to}} combine the benefits of both visual and automatic techniques. Initially, SWAS automatically estimates shear-wave polarisations and picks shear-wave arrivals by an expert system, which provides sufficiently accurate initial measurements for visual adjustment. SWAS then allows easy comparison and adjustment of picks between screen images of original seismograms, seismograms rotated into anisotropic polarisations, and polarisation diagrams (<b>hodograms),</b> with immediate plotting in various standard or non-standard configurations. This speeds up visual measurements by well over an order of magnitude, and typically allows records of almost all small earthquakes (M ≥ − 1. 0) to be reliably measured for shear-wave splitting polarisations and time-delays.

We observed a number of discrete frequency oscillations for the fast mode wave, one of which drives a field line resonance (FLR) at characteristic latitude as detected by both ground and satellite measurements. Consequently, our observations confirmed the compressional wave as being the driver of the field line resonance. The toroidal mode frequency observed on CHAMP experienced a Doppler frequency shift due to the rapid motion across the resonance region.

40|$|The {{prospecting}} of densely {{urbanized areas}} by {{the measurement of}} magnetic and electric natural fields is severely hampered by electromagnetic (EM) noise. Active man-made EM noise sources can generally be considered fixed in space, thus affecting the magnetotelluric (MT) signals of a measuring site mainly along their polarization directions. 7 Taking advantage of the impulsive nature of polarized EM noise, a time-domain directional noise cancelling (DNC) technique is proposed. The comparison of noisy data with data predicted, using a low noise reference signal or with data interpolated whenever no reference is available, allows the detection of the most likely noise sources with prevailing directional patterns using a Bayes’s criterion. The DNC approach is general and can be adapted, depending on the reference signal used (single-site or remote-reference). In field data, <b>hodograms</b> of the prediction residuals basically confirm the directional noise model assumed in DNC. An example is presented in which the DNC technique {{has been applied to}} a single-site MT survey carried out in northern Italy, where the signal was heavily corrupted by noise with prevailing directional properties due to the densely urbanized area.

We find two regions where the ROID is high: in stream-stream interaction regions and in Alfven wave trains. This latter feature is particularly obvious at high latitudes when Ulysses enters a high speed stream associated with a polar coronal hole. These streams are characterized {{by the presence of}} continuous, large-amplitude (Delta (vector 13) /absolute value of B is about 1 - 2 Alfven waves and an extraordinarily high ROID value (approximately 150 discontinuities/day). In a number of intervals examined, it is found that (rotational) discontinuities {{are an integral part of}} the Alfven waves. The nonlinear Alfven waves are spherically polarized, i. e., the tip of the perturbation vector resides on the surface of a sphere (a consequence of constant absolute value of B). The slowly rotating part of the wave rotates approximately 270 deg in phase. There is a slight arc in the B(sub 1) - B(sub 2) <b>hodogram,</b> suggesting an almost linear polarization. The phase rotation associated with the discontinuity is about 90 deg, lies in the same plane as the slowly rotaing part of the Alfven wave, and therefore completes the 360 deg phase rotation.

Shake maps are computed to provide estimates of the spatial distribution of the induced ground motion. The signals recorded at the Mirandola (MRN) station, the closest to the epicenter, have been processed to obtain acceleration, velocity and displacement response spectra. Ground-motion parameters from the MRN recordings are compared with the corresponding estimates from recent ground-motion prediction equations, and with the spectra prescribed by the current Italian Building Code for different return periods. The records from the MRN station are used to plot the particle orbit (<b>hodogram)</b> described by the waveform. The availability of results from geotechnical field tests that were performed at a few sites in the Municipality of Mirandola prior to this earthquake of May 2012 has allowed preliminary assessment of the ground response. The amplification effects at Mirandola are estimated using fully stochastic site-response analyses. The seismic input comprises seven actual records that are compatible with the Italian code-based spectrum that refers to a 475 -year return period. The computed acceleration response spectrum and the associated dispersion are compared to the spectra calculated from the recordings of the MRN station.

This fact in combination with the existence of dense seismological networks provided an excellent opportunity for the study of crustal seismic anisotropy. Of special note is the seismic crisis period of May–October, during which the main feature was the occurrence of the Helike seismic swarm. Polarigrams and <b>hodograms</b> were employed to analyze local waveforms. This method resulted in 659 measurements of shear-wave splitting parameters, namely the direction of the fast shear-wave (Sfast), the time-delay (Td) between the two split shear-waves and the source polarization direction. A pattern of a general WNW–ESE anisotropy direction, parallel to the GoC’s fault systems’ strike, is established, with the exception of two stations located in adjacent areas at the north. This is in agreement with the existence of fluid-filled microcracks, oriented according to the regional stress field. The obtained splitting parameters are compared to the results of other anisotropy studies performed in the WGoC. A detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of the normalized time-delay (Tn) was performed to associate temporal stress changes to seismicity fluctuations.

40|$|Determining the {{relative}} {{orientation of the}} horizontal components of seismic sensors is a common problem that limits data analysis and interpretation for several acquisition setups, including linear arrays of geophones deployed in borehole installations or ocean bottom seismometers deployed at the seafloor. To solve this problem we propose a new inversion method based on a complex linear algebra approach. Relative orientation angles are retrieved by minimizing, in a least-squares sense, the l 2 -norm between the complex traces (<b>hodograms)</b> of adjacent pairs of sensors. This methodology can be applied without restrictions only if the wavefield recorded by each pair of sensors is very similar. In most cases, {{it is possible to}} satisfy this condition by low-pass filtering the recorded waveforms. The main advantage of our methodology is that, in the complex domain, {{the relative}} orientations of seismic sensors {{can be viewed as a}} linear inverse problem, which ensures that the preferred solution corresponds to the global minimum of a misfit function. It is also possible to use simultaneously more than one independent data set (other seismic events) to better constrain the solution of the inverse problem. Furthermore, by a computational point of view, our method results faster than the relative orientation methods based on waveform cross-correlation. After several tests on synthetic data sets we applied successfully our methodology to different types of real data. These applications include the alignment of borehole sensors relative to a Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) acquisition and the orientation of Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) relative to a neighbouring land station of known orientation. Using land stations, the absolute orientation of OBS can be retrieved. Finally, as a last application, we checked the correct orientation for land stations of a seismological array in Germany.

40|$|Recently Breneman et al. {{reported}} {{observations of}} large amplitude lightning and transmitter whistler mode waves from two STEREO {{passes through the}} inner radiation belt (L< 2). <b>Hodograms</b> of the electric field in the plane transverse to the magnetic field showed that the transmitter waves underwent periodic polarization reversals. Specifically, their polarization would cycle through a pattern of right-hand to linear to left-hand polarization {{at a rate of}} roughly 200 Hz. The lightning whistlers were observed to be left-hand polarized at frequencies greater than the lower hybrid frequency and less than the transmitter frequency (21. 4 kHz) and right-hand polarized otherwise. Only righthand polarized waves in the inner radiation belt should exist in the frequency range of the whistler mode and these reversals were not explained in the previous paper. We show, with a combination of observations and simulated wave superposition, that these polarization reversals are due to the beating of an incident electromagnetic whistler mode wave at 21. 4 kHz and linearly polarized, symmetric lower hybrid sidebands Doppler-shifted from the incident wave by +/- 200 Hz. The existence of the lower hybrid waves is consistent with the parametric decay mechanism of Lee and Kuo whereby an incident whistler mode wave decays into symmetric, short wavelength lower hybrid waves and a purely growing (zero-frequency) mode. Like the lower hybrid waves, the purely growing mode is Doppler-shifted by 200 Hz as observed on STEREO. This decay mechanism in the upper ionosphere has been previously reported at equatorial latitudes and is thought to have a direct connection with explosive spread F enhancements. As such it may represent another dissipation mechanism of VLF wave energy in the ionosphere and may help to explain a deficit of observed lightning and transmitter energy in the inner radiation belts as reported by Starks et al...|$|R

Recently, {{hydraulic}} fracturing {{is used in}} various fields and microseismic monitoring {{is one of the}} best methods for judging where hydraulic fractures exist and how they are developing. When locating microseismic events using single vertical well data, distances from the vertical array and depths from the surface are generally decided using time differences between compressional (P) wave and shear (S) wave arrivals and azimuths are calculated using P wave <b>hodogram</b> analysis. However, in field data, it is sometimes hard to acquire P wave data which has smaller amplitude than S wave because microseismic data often have very low signal to noise (S/N) ratio. To overcome this problem, in this study, we developed a grid search algorithm which can find event location using all combinations of arrival times recorded at receivers. In addition, we introduced and analyzed the method which calculates azimuths using S wave. The tests of synthetic data show the inversion method using all combinations of arrival times and receivers can locate events without considering the origin time even using only single phase. In addition, the method can locate events with higher accuracy and has lower sensitivity on first arrival picking errors than conventional method. The method which calculates azimuths using S wave can provide reliable results when the dip between event and receiver is relatively small.

Wavelet transformation reveals that for each high-latitude pair, the dominant frequency of the first burst is {{higher than that of}} the second. But at low latitudes, the dominant frequency does not change. It is suggested that both pairs result from fast magnetospheric cavity waves with the second burst also containing shear Alfvén waves. INTERMAGNET magnetograms at auroral latitudes showed magnetic variations affected by two recurrent electrojets for each pair. The ground-based magnetometers and those at geostationary orbit sensed magnetic perturbations consistent with the formation of the substorm current wedge. Four consecutive enhancements of energetic electron and ion fluxes detected by the THEMIS probes in the dayside magnetosphere appeared in the later afternoon and then in the early afternoon. The horizontal magnetic variation vectors had vortex patterns similar to those induced by the upward and downward field-aligned currents during substorm times. The <b>hodogram</b> at mid- L stations had a polarization pattern similar to the one induced by the substorm current wedge for each Pi 2 burst. The mapping of ground Pi 2 onset timing to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) observations shows that they appear under two cycles of north-to-south and then north variation. CLUSTER 4 in the south lobe observed wave-like magnetic fluctuations, probably driven by near-Earth reconnection, similar to those on the ground.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is proposed {{to account for}} some of the behavior of arc-polarized magnetic structures seen in the solar wind. To this end, an exact analytical solution is developed that describes infinite plane wave trains of arbitrary amplitude in a plasma governed by ideal Hall MHD. The main focus is on intermediate-mode wave trains, which display double-branched magnetic <b>hodogram</b> signatures similar to those seen in the solar wind. The theoretically derived hodograms have field rotation in the ion-polarized sense at a slightly depressed field magnitude on one branch and an electron-polarized rotation at a slightly enhanced field magnitude on the other branch. The two branches are joined at the two "turning points", at which the normal flow is exactly Alfvénic. The behavior is accounted for in terms of the opposite dispersive properties of ion and electron whistlers. The hodograms derived from the theory are shown to compare favorably with those of one event, observed by the Cluster spacecraft near the ecliptic plane, and one event at high heliographic latitude observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. However, these two observed structures comprise only a single full wave period, approximately from one turning point to the other and then back again. The theory can be used to predict propagation direction (away from, or towards, the sun) from magnetic data alone, provided the sign of the magnetic field component along the wave normal can be reliably determined. Under the same condition, it also predicts whether the ion-polarized branch should precede or follow the electron-polarized branch. Both behaviors are seen in the solar wind. The major shortcoming of the theory is that it fails to reproduce the observed saw-tooth like time series for the magnetic field, in which the field rotation is rapid in the ion sense and slow in the electron sense. Instead, the theory gives about the same rotation rates. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Also discussed {{is the fact that the}} magnetic field measurements by Cluster, while giving high quality determinations of normal direction and normal field component for each of the four spacecraft, indicate a reversal of the normal field component and the predicted propagation sense during the event, as well as a wide spread in the four normal vector orientations...|$|E

The waves are seen most clearly in radar-derived profiles of buoyancy frequency (N). Here, we present {{a case study of}} typical waves from 21 February to 22 February 2007. Good agreement between N 2 derived from radiosondes and by radar shows the validity of the radar determination of N 2. Large-amplitude wave signatures in N 2 are clearly observed by the radar and the radiosondes in the lowermost stratosphere, from 9 km to 14 – 16 km height. Vertical profiles of horizontal wind components and potential temperature from the radiosondes show the same waves. Mesoscale simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are carried out to complement the analysis of the waves. Good agreement between the radar and radiosonde measurements and the model (except for the wave amplitude) shows that the model gives realistic results and that the waves are closely associated to the upper-level front in an upper-troposphere jet–front system. Hodographs of the wind fluctuations from the radiosondes and model data show that the waves propagate upward in the lower stratosphere confirming that the origin of the waves is in the troposphere. The observations and modelling all indicate vertical wavelengths of 700 ± 200 m. The radiosonde <b>hodograms</b> indicate horizontal wavelengths between 40 and 110 km and intrinsic periods between 6 and 9 h.

40|$|International audienceMany {{attempts}} have been made to disclose anomalous changes of the electromagnetic field in relation with tectonic earthquakes. We tentatively develop a new approach based on the energy and polarity of the electric field, and apply this method to the seismicity in Greece. The study of the parameters of the horizontal electric field is realized in a time interval of five years. The data set allows the study of long-term variations of the field. Further, we examined the possible relation of the geoelectric activity with long distance seismicity (up to 500 km). The energy of the electric signal was estimated and correlated with the logarithm of the seismic moment (M 0). The values of the seismic moment estimated for each earthquake were summed for daily intervals, and the logarithm of the sum was computed. The same process was applied to the energy of the geoelectric field. Then, a correlation was attempted between the energy of the geoelectric field and the seismic moment referring to daily intervals. In two cases, changes in the energy of the horizontal geoelectric field were observed before the burst of the seismic activity. The energy of the telluric field increased several months before the burst of seismic activity and recovered right after the occurrence of the mainshocks. The <b>hodograms</b> of the horizontal geoelectric field show polarization changes regardless of the magnetic field. This is possibly attributed to the process of generation of electric currents before major earthquakes. Due to high and continuous regional seismicity in Greece, it was impossible to attribute the response of the polarization to the activation of specific seismic areas. It seems that the long-term energy variations of the horizontal geoelectric field as well as the polarization are related to forthcoming seismic activity. Therefore, long-term energy variations of the horizontal geoelectric field as well as the polarization could be used in tandem with other possible precursors in order to contribute to earthquake prediction studies...|$|R

Part {{of this work}} {{has been reported in}} 15418 R 03. Most of portions of these tasks have been executed independently. We progressed steadily and completed some of the sub-tasks, while others are still on going. We achieved the goals that we had set up in the task schedule. Reviewing the results of this work period indicates that our plan is solid and we did not encounter any unforeseen problems. The work plan will continue as scheduled. A midyear review will be presented in November or December 2004. Several independent tasks pursuant the statement of project objectives have been executed simultaneously and are still on-going. Use of real seismic test data is augmented by the creation a 3 D ray tracing synthetic test data. We used the previously constructed 3 D layered model and simulated data acquisition from a set of circular source locations at the surface of the model, while a close to vertical VSP well was used to capture the wave field data. The source pattern was optimized with respect to Fresnel zone width at the target depth. Multi-component particle displacements were recorded every 50 ft down with an array length of 4, 000 ft. P-P as well as P-S reflections were specified in the resulting wave field. We ensured a large enough aperture with enough fine sampling to perform advanced processing, imaging and analysis tests in the future during this project. We constantly improved the interfacing of our software libraries with newly designed 3 C display classes and mechanisms. We used the previously implemented 3 C Work Bench tool as the primary prototyping tool. This work bench allows to load as well as manipulate and display data items in a flexible manner. We continued to demonstrate its basic functionality by loading source maps, horizons, seismic and velocity volumes, well logs into the tool, performing basic QC steps as is necessary in normal processing. We improved functionality by adding multiple windowing options to each of the display items. The windows can be docked or un-docked, which is advantageous in a practical sense, since the display real estate can be spread across multiple display monitors. All windows transparently tie into the same item tree and views get updated dynamically and transparently. Each display item can be associated with a particular display widget as is the case for the multi-component <b>hodogram</b> display widget. All tasks were performed successfully, ensuring the continued progress of this project as outlined in the original proposal. Deliverables generated during this time period consist of reporting details and synthetically modeled seismic data for a 3 D layered geological model. The numerically modeled SEGY data, as well as the model representation data, are ready to be sent out to DOE facilities for archiving. Based on the successful conclusion of work performed during this three month period we continue to occasionally generate synthetically modeled 3 D borehole seismic data, according to Tasks 2 and 3. At the same time we proceed to design, implement and test according to the original plan the basic data classes and the basic framework outlined in Tasks 5 through 11, as well as 16...|$|E

Podaci su prikupljeni polustrukturiranim intervjuima s nastavnicima i obrađeni postupcima kodiranja i kategoriziranja u pristupu utemeljene teorije. Istraživanje je pokazalo da je sukus društvenih procesa vezanih uz bolonjske promjene studijskih programa na Filozofskom fakultetu bio fleksibilizirati <b>hodogram</b> i omogućiti veću slobodu, s obzirom na omjer obvezatnih i izbornih predmeta, kronološki redoslijed, propedeutičke pristupe, odnos teorijskih i praktičnih sadržaja, usredotočenost na ishode učenja naspram usredotočenosti na struku i podučavanje, jednosemestralnost predmeta te profiliranje smjerova. Fleksibilizacija navedenih elemenata provedena je u praksu do stanovite granice, a tu granicu predstavljala je zaštita zasada struke. Rezultati upućuju na zaključak da Bolonjska reforma nije kozmetička reforma, nego zadire u esencijalne elemente struke, kao što je pitanje određivanja važnijih odnosno perifernijih grana struke. Ta pitanja nisu ni dodirnuta u priopćenjima Bolonjskog procesa na europskoj razini, nego ih je potrebno promišljati od struke do struke, pa i od odsjeka do odsjeka. Naše istraživanje ukazalo je na to da novi okviri traže dubinske sadržajne i metodičke zahvate, pokreću pitanja koja se ne odnose samo na nastavu nego traže promišljanje supstancijalnih pitanja struka. Nužno je pažljivo razlučivanje između segmenata studijskih programa koji su prilagodljivi, i onih koji nisu, te uspostava prave ravnoteže među njima. Tako korjenitu reformu na velikom Fakultetu bilo je nemoguće unaprijed cjelovito promisliti prije prvih iskustava s novim okvirom. To znači da ima osnove za reviziju implementacije Bolonjske reforme na nekim sastavnicama Sveučilišta u Zagrebu. The paper brings {{results from}} a {{grounded}} theory qualitative research study, which examined how the faculty members of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Zagreb perceived {{the changes in the}} study programmes following the Bologna reform. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews with university professors and teaching assistants, and analysed using coding and other grounded theory techniques and procedures. The research revealed that the main goal of the Bologna reform, as undertaken at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, was to increase the flexibility and choice with regards to the following aspects of the study programmes: ratio between compulsory and elective courses, chronological order of course content, propaedeutics, relation between theoretical and practical course content, focus on learning outcomes vs. focus on discipline and teaching, single semester courses, and development of clearer course tracks. These changes were only partially implemented, limited by the tendency to protect the foundations of particular disciplines. The research results indicate that the Bologna reform is far from just a cosmetic initiative but, rather, penetrates into the very essences of scientific disciplines, such as determining major vs. peripheral branches of disciplines. These issues were never even addressed in Bologna process communiqués at the European level and, therefore, each discipline, and even each department, had to thoroughly discuss and resolve them on their own. This research showed that {{in order to have a}} successful implementation of Bologna requirements, disciplines themselves must re-examine the very foundations and substantive content on which they rest. It is necessary to carefully discriminate between the segments of the study programmes that are flexible and adjustable and those that are not, and to find the right balance between them. To undertake such a thorough reflection, at such a large Faculty, without any prior experience with this new framework, was nearly impossible. It may, therefore, be necessary to revise the implementation of the Bologna reform at particular Faculties of the University of Zagreb, such as the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.. Mit Hilfe des qualitativen Ansatzes begründeter Theorie wurde erforscht, wie Lehrkräfte an der Philosophischen Fakultät der Universität in Zagreb die Änderungen der im Rahmen des Bologna-Prozesses durchgeführten Studienprogramme wahrnehmen. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe halbstrukturierter Interviews mit Lehrkräften gesammelt und durch Kodierungs- und Kategorisierungsverfahren im Ansatz der begründeten Theorie bearbeitet. Die Forschung hat gezeigt, dass das Wesentliche der gesellschaftlichen Prozesse, die an durch die Bologna-Reform entstandenen Änderungen der Studienprogramme gebunden sind, war, das Hodogramm zu flexibilisieren und mehr Freiheit hinsichtlich des Verhältnisses von Pflicht- und Wahlfächern zu ermöglichen, die chronologische Reihenfolge, die propedeutischen Ansätze, Verhältnis von theoretischen und praktischen Inhalten, Fokus auf Lernerergebnisse im Gegensatz zum Fokus auf das Fach und Lehren, einsemestrige Kollegs und Profilierung von Schwerpunkten. Die Flexibilisierung der genannten Elemente ist in der Praxis bis zu einer bestimmten Grenze durchgeführt worden, bis zu den Grundlagen des Fachs. Es zeigt sich, dass die Bologna-Reform keine kosmetische Reform ist, sondern sie betrifft die essentiellen Elemente des Fachs, wie z. B. die Frage der Bestimmung von wichtigen und weniger wichtigen Zweigen des Fachs. Diese Fragen wurden von den Mitteilungen des Bologna-Prozesses auf der europäischen Ebene nicht einmal berührt, deshalb ist es nötig, sie vom Fach zu Fach, oder sogar von Fachabteilung zu Fachabteilung zu reflektieren. Unsere Forschung hat darauf hingewiesen, dass neue Rahmen tiefe inhaltliche und methodische Eingriffe bedürfen, sie bewegen die Fragen, die sich nucht nur auf den Unterricht beziehen, sondern auch Überlegungen von substantiellen Fragen fordern. Es ist unbedingt nötig, anpassungsfähige Segmente von Studienprogrammen von nicht anpassungsfähigen Segmenten zu unterscheiden und ein Gleichgewicht zwischen ihnen zu schaffen. Es war unmöglich, eine so tiefgründige Reform an einer großen Fakultät gänzlich zu reflektieren, bevor man die ersten Erfahrungen mit dem Rahmen hatte. Das bedeutet, dass es für eine Revision der Implementierung von Bologna-Reform an einigen Fakultäten der Universität Zagreb Grund gibt...|$|E
