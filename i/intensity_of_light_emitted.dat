The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions.

A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).|$|E

5000|$|... ’’Brightness’’ {{refers to}} a {{subjective}} sense that the object considered is emitting light. Whereas the perceptual correlates of color are the frequencies of light that compose the light spectrum, the perceptual correlate of brightness is luminance, or the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> by an object. While it may seem obvious that the sensation of brightness is straightforwardly related to the amount or intensity of light coming to the eyes, perception researchers {{have long known that}} brightness is not caused solely by the luminance incident on the retina.

40|$|The optical {{transitions}} of a chiral, three-substituted polythiophene with an {{amino acid}} function can be tuned by interactions with synthetic peptides.

50|$|The {{effect of}} Black Light Theatre allows {{invisible}} performers to move visible props, turning the objects into independent {{participants in the}} theatre {{at the same level}} as the human actors. Furthermore, the appearance of objects and actors in a performance can be sudden and can occur anywhere on stage, even within a few meters of an audience member. In order to achieve this effect it is necessary to create an intense field of UV light throughout the entire playing space. Because the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> from a typical 'black light' source diminishes significantly with increased distance from the source, covering an entire theatre space with UV light requires either that the 'black light' sources be spaced as close as one meter apart or emit much more light than a typical 'black light'. Another important consideration is that, since most of the space is completely dark, and the form is heavily dance based, a single wrong move by a single performer can negatively impact the entire production. For this reason performers train extensively specifically for the Black Light Theatre environment.|$|E
40|$|Normally carbon {{monoxide}} {{is considered to}} be a reducing agent, which can be used for CO detection. However, oxidizing behaviour of CO, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported. In this work, we find that CO can also act as oxidizing gas at room temperature on photostimulated ZnO nanowires. For photostimulation, the low <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diodes is used to induce a very low photocurrent, which, however, leads to a large resistance change due to the ultraviolet light interaction with the nanowire surface. During CO detection, the oxygen vacancies enhance the CO adsorption on the nanowire surface even at roomtemperature. CO molecules adsorbing on the surface are presumably bound to a zinc-oxygen vacancy complex, causing a reduction in free electron concentration, which leads to an oxidizing effect of CO gas. An adsorption model for CO is proposed to explain the experimental observations. These results shed light on developing room-temperature CO sensor using oxide nanostructures with the help of high energetic photon replacing the high-temperature process normally used in traditional gas sensors...|$|R
50|$|Optical {{spectroscopy}} {{is further}} divided into {{atomic absorption spectroscopy}} and atomic emission spectroscopy. In atomic absorption spectroscopy, <b>light</b> <b>of</b> a predetermined wavelength is passed through a collection of atoms.

The difference between the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> from the source (e.g., lamp) and the light collected by the detector yields an absorbance value. This absorbance value can then {{be used to determine}} the concentration of a given element (or atoms) within the sample. The relationship between the concentration of atoms, the distance the light travels through the collection of atoms, and the portion <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> absorbed is given by the Beer-Lambert law.

50|$|To {{illuminate}} {{a particular}} cell, the electrodes that intersect at the cell are charged by control circuitry and electric current {{flows through the}} cell, stimulating the gas (typically xenon and neon) atoms inside the cell. These ionized gas atoms, or plasmas, then release ultraviolet photons that interact with a phosphor material on the inside wall of the cell. The phosphor atoms are stimulated and electrons jump to higher energy levels. When these electrons return to their natural state, energy is released {{in the form of}} visible light. Every pixel on the display is made up of three subpixel cells. One subpixel cell is coated with red phosphor, another is coated with green phosphor, and the third cell is coated with blue phosphor. Light emitted from the subpixel cells is blended together to create an overall color for the pixel. The control circuitry can manipulate the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> from each cell, and therefore can produce a large gamut of colors. Light from each cell can be controlled and changed rapidly to produce a high-quality moving picture.|$|E

40|$|A {{fluorescence}} recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) {{machine is}} an elaborate and expensive device which can excite the molecules {{of a sample}} of fluorescently dyed cell plasma membrane and measure the number of photons that the sample emits. The knowledge gained through such an experiment is biomedically useful because the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> {{can be used to}} guage the mobility of the proteins in the plasma membrane. Because FRAP detectors are so costly, the goal in this project is to design and construct an electrical FRAP simulator. The rate, R(t), at which the photons are emitted from the membrane after excitation, is governed by the equation: R(t) = A - B/(l+Ct) + D/(1 +Ct) ², where t is time and A,B,C,D are positive constants. Given A,B,C,D and the other characteristics of a FRAP detector: opening and closing shutter delays, overload level of the PMT, and steady-state rate of photon emission before strong laser beam excitation; an analog voltage output, R(t), is produced. R(t) is created by using an integrator and a series of dividing, squaring, multiplying, and summing circuits. Finally, a TTL output with a frequency proportional to R(t) is produced by using a voltage contolled oscillator. TTL outputs, which describe the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>emitted</b> before and during excitation of the molecules, are also simulated and are then combined with this VCO output to produce the entire output. This output should closely mimic the output of a real FRAP device...|$|R
