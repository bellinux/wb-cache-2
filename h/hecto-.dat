500|$|A set of {{characters}} representing various metric units {{was created in}} Japan in the late 19th century. Characters, which are the same in Chinese, exist for three base units: the metre (...) , litre (...) and gram (...) [...] These were combined {{with a set of}} six prefix characters – kilo- (...) , <b>hecto-</b> (...) , deca- (...) , deci- (...) , centi- (...) and milli- (...) – to form an additional 18 single-character units. The seven length units (kilometre to millimetre), for example, are [...] and [...] These characters, however, are not in common use today; instead, units are written in katakana, the Japanese syllabary used for foreign borrowings, such as [...] for kilometre, but are also written in standard prefixes such as [...] "km" [...] for kilometre. A few Sino-Japanese words for these units remain in use in Japanese, most significantly [...] "" [...] (heibei) for [...] "square metre", but otherwise borrowed pronunciations are used.|$|E
50|$|This {{measure is}} {{included}} in the SI mostly for completeness: in principle, any combination of prefix and unit can be written, but many are rarely used in practice. One practical use of the decameter is for altitude of geopotential heights in meteorology. Meteorologists also use another seldom encountered SI prefix: <b>hecto-</b> in hectopascal (hPa). The volumetric form (see below) cubic decametre is convenient for describing large volumes of water such as in rivers and lakes.|$|E
50|$|Hecate is {{also the}} namesake of the {{hundredth}} numbered asteroid, which was discovered by American astronomer James Craig Watson on July 11, 1868. Its adopted name commemorates it as the hundredth asteroid, especially as 'hekaton' is Greek for 'hundred.' The name may also be explained as the derivation of the prefix <b>hecto-</b> commonly used in the metric system, or within the decimal system as three digits (e.g. as 100) therefore reflecting her later mythological trinary form.|$|E
5000|$|Some meteorologists {{prefer the}} hectopascal (hPa) for {{atmospheric}} air pressure, which {{is equivalent to}} the older unit millibar (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the <b>hecto-</b> prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in decibars (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth. The standard atmosphere (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth mean sea level and is defined as [...]|$|E

40|$|American medical {{journals}} are shifting to selected SI (Système International d'Unités) units for reporting measurements. Limitation of SI units deemed {{suitable for use}} in reporting clinical laboratory results stems from recommendations put forth by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Limitations are: 1) the liter as sole recommended unit of volume in concentration measurement; 2) substance concentration (unit mole) favored over mass concentration (submultiples of the kilogram); and 3) discouraging {{the use of the}} prefixes <b>hecto-,</b> deca-, deci-, and centi-. Further discussion by the American Medical Association and other organizations is required before consensus in the US medical community can be reached as to extent of and time frame for conversion to SI for reporting clinical laboratory measurements...|$|E
30|$|Instability and {{reproducibility}} of resistive switching {{in single}} ZnO-nanorod/nanowire {{can be further}} improved by utilizing plasma treatment [60, 61] and introduction of other metal elements, such as Cu [66], Ga, and Sb [62]. It is also reported that self-compliance and self-rectifying characteristic can be induced by Na doping on ZnO-nanowire ECM type devices [70]. Single nanorod/nanowire-based devices offer ultra-low operation current, {{in the range of}} pico- to microamperes; however, the high operation voltage, in the range of <b>hecto-</b> to deka-volts, is still a main challenge in the development of this kind of resistive memory device [60 – 62, 66, 70, 75]. Despite ZnO:K,Cl micro/nanowire devices exhibited low operation voltage; however, the operation current is in the range of milliamperes which is quite high for its class [63]. In another report, low current and voltage operation is exhibited in Ag/Zn 2 SnO 3 -sheated ZnO-core heterostructure nanowire/Ag device [67]; yet, the fabrication of this heterostructure is quite complex and may limit fabrication reproducibility.|$|E

It is important to be able {{to convert from}} one metric unit to another. We will be using 3 base units: gram (to measure mass) meter (to measure distance) liter (to measure volume) Below is a table that gives you the base units in the center, larger units to the left of center, and smaller units to the right of center. To convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, you simply need to move your decimal point to the left the required number of places. To convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, you move your decimal point to the right the required number of places. mega- kilo- <b>hecto-</b> deca- base unit deci- centi- milli- micro- nano...|$|E
