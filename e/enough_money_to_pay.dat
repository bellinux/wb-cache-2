5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E
5|$|When the Bank Street {{ground was}} {{temporarily}} closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the club's next away game at Bristol City {{and found a}} temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, {{as well as the}} ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.|$|E
5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E
50|$|A {{covenant}} {{existed on}} the McCain Stadium that restricted its use only to sporting activities. Scarborough F.C. failed {{to convince the}} Scarborough Borough Council that its proposals to sell the McCain Stadium to a housing developer would raise <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> both <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> off the debts and build a new ground.|$|R

5|$|Pat Moran, {{the foreman}} of a {{construction}} gang, {{worked hard to}} save up <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the passage {{of his wife and}} daughter to their new home in America. On the day of their arrival, he heads to the pier to greet them and becomes involved in a serious accident. He is injured and taken unconscious to the hospital as an unidentified patient. His wife and daughter know nothing of what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore. Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved from}} Florence, South Carolina, to New York City {{at the age}} of 17. Working a variety of jobs, he saved <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for classes at the prestigious National Academy of Design. He took a preparatory class with Charles Louis Hinton, then studied with Charles Courtney Curran and George Willoughby Maynard, all of whom {{emphasized}} classical portraiture and figure drawing. Beginning in 1923, Johnson worked with the painter Charles Webster Hawthorne, who emphasized the importance of color in painting. John studied with Hawthorne at the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts during the summers, paying for his tuition, food and lodging by working as a general handyman at the school. Johnson received a number of awards at the National Academy of Design, and applied for a coveted Pulitzer Travel Scholarship in his final year. When another student was given the award, Hawthorne raised nearly $1000 to enable Johnson to go abroad to study.|$|E
5000|$|Future award {{events were}} more somber. By the next year's event, one {{fifth of the}} 2000 nominees were out of business, {{and more than half}} of the winners had been sold, {{suffered}} layoffs, or failed. [...] By 2002, there was not <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> available <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a live event.|$|R
25|$|In England, Bing {{trained as}} a {{physical}} therapist. At first she {{took a job as}} a student nurse, as physical therapy training was cheaper after one year of student nursing, and it was difficult <b>to</b> get <b>money</b> abroad from Germany at that time. However, she was forced to quit halfway through after falling ill and having to have surgery. After she moved to London, her family managed <b>to</b> get <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> her <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for her training.

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

25|$|On December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin {{noted that}} Ukrainian {{consumers}} pay less for gas than do Russians. He claimed that Ukraine had <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> market price. Putin {{also noted that}} Russia subsidized Ukraine by $1billion {{a year from the}} Russian budgetmoney that Gazprom would have paid from its revenues. He also noted that 25million Russians live below the poverty line, further questioning Ukraine's deal.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investors to}} purchase shares, the three partners guaranteed that a 6 percent dividend {{would be paid}} every year. To ensure that there was <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> this divided, each partner agreed to put 3,000 of their own NALC shares in escrow. Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson were entitled to receive a 2.5 percent commission on any land the company sold. Greenleaf was named secretary of the new company.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Bob Kleberg, Jr., {{the son of}} Bob Kleberg, Sr. and Alice Gertrudis King, leased the {{exploration}} and drilling rights on the ranch to Humble Oil of Houston, Texas for $127,824, {{in exchange for the}} usual royalty of 1/8 of every barrel (20 L) of oil pumped from the property. Humble Oil loaned <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the debts of the H.M. King estate, secured by a first mortgage on the land. Humble struck oil and gas by 1939. During all of this, the Ranch was a going concern, with a net profit of $227,382, as early as 1926.|$|E

25|$|Following the marriage, Tudor {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, which was based at Lydd, Kent, England. Larissa was ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and spinal caries {{and was unable to}} sit up straight. She spent her days reclining in an elongated bath chair. The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing in the garden of their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars and he had no personal fortune, he had <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} pitched {{the idea of}} Pokémon to Nintendo, they could not quite grasp the concept, but were {{impressed}} enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore the concept. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. Pokémon Red and Blue took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.|$|E
25|$|The crusade went badly {{from the}} start – Theobald died in 1201 and the army that arrived at Venice {{in the summer of}} 1202 was one third the size that had been {{anticipated}} (4,500 knights, 9,000 squires, 20,000 men at-arms expected). Consequently, there was not <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the aging and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt.). At the time, Venetian envoys were discussing trade terms with the Egyptians – but {{in the end it was}} decided that such discussions would have allowed them to deceive the Egyptians.|$|E

25|$|Land revenue {{settlements}} {{constituted a}} major administrative {{activity of the}} various governments in India under Company rule. In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted {{a large proportion of}} the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army.|$|E
25|$|In September 1934, Malden {{decided to}} leave his home in Gary, Indiana, to pursue formal {{dramatic}} training at the Goodman School (later part of DePaul University), then associated with the Goodman Theater in Chicago. Although he {{had worked in the}} steel mills in Gary for three years, he had helped support his family and was consequently unable to save <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his schooling. Making a deal with the director of the program, he gave the institute the little money that he did have, with the director agreeing that, if Malden did well, he would be rewarded with a full scholarship. He won the scholarship. When Malden performed in the Goodman's children's theater, he wooed the actress Mona Greenberg (stage name: Mona Graham), who married him in 1938. He graduated from the Chicago Art Institute in 1937. Soon after, without work and without money, Malden returned to his hometown.|$|E
25|$|Her {{elementary}} education consisted of {{attendance at the}} local school that her parents had started. The Walkers were determined that their daughters be as well-educated as their son, so they founded the first free school house in Oswego in the late 1830s. After finishing primary school, Mary and two of her older sisters attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York. Falley was not only an institution of higher learning, but a place that emphasized modern social reform in gender roles, education, and hygiene. Its ideologies and practices further cemented Mary's determination to defy traditional feminine standards on a principle of injustice. In her free time, Mary would pore over her father's medical texts on anatomy and physiology; her interest in medicine is attributable to her exposure to medical literature at an early age. As a young woman, she taught at a school in Minetto, New York, eventually earning <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> her way through Syracuse Medical College (now the State University of New York Upstate Medical University), where she graduated with honors as a medical doctor in 1855, {{the only woman in}} her class.|$|E
