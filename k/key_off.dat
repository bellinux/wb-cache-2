2500|$|The {{music video}} debuted on December 10, 2012. It was {{directed}} by Syndrome and features actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Alexandra Daddario and puppeteers from Puppet Heap. The video revolves around a mysterious female drifter (Daddario) on a quest to save her friends (Imagine Dragons) from the perils of a sinister, underground puppet-fighting ring. The [...] "Champion" [...] of the fight, a large purple beast, beats and kills innocent stuffed animals and puppets forced to fight. After one puppet, [...] "Screaming Richard", is killed, the woman's pink teddy bear puppet enters the ring and fights [...] "Champion", initially being beaten up. After rising from the ground, the teddy bear knocks out [...] "Champion" [...] with a single superpower punch. The ringleader (Phillips) sends two human body guards to subdue the teddy, but both are disintegrated by the teddy's laser vision. The remaining spectators flee, leaving the drifter with the stunned ringleader. The drifter takes a <b>key</b> <b>off</b> the chain around the ringleader's neck and unlocks the dungeon holding the band. They walk out, leaving the ringleader in the dungeon; he is soon surrounded and attacked by the earlier defeated puppets and stuffed animals.|$|E

Such things are all very well in books where your amateur detectives, who know everything before it's done, can fit them into theories; but in Scotland Yard, where the men aren't all idiots either, we generally find that when crime is done, or attempted, it's people, not things, that are at the bottom of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|It now {{remains to}} mention the fate of Robin Oig--for the other sons of Rob Roy {{seem to have been}} no way distinguished. Robin was apprehended by a party of {{military}} from the fort of Inversnaid, at the foot of Gartmore, and was conveyed to Edinburgh 26th May 1753. After a delay, which may have been protracted by the negotiations of James for delivering up Allan Breck Stewart upon promise of his brother's life, Robin Oig, on the 24th of December 1753, was brought to the bar of the High Court of Justiciary, and indicted by the name of Robert MacGregor, alias Campbell, alias Drummond, alias Robert Oig; and the evidence led against him resembled exactly that which was brought by the Crown on the former trial. Robert's case was in some degree more favourable than his brother's;--for, though the principal in the forcible marriage, he had yet to plead that he had shown symptoms of relenting while they were carrying Jean <b>Key</b> <b>off,</b> which were silenced by the remonstrances and threats of his harder natured brother James. A considerable space of time had also elapsed since the poor woman died, which is always a strong circumstance in favour of the accused; for there is a sort of perspective in guilt, and crimes of an old date seem less odious than those of recent occurrence. But notwithstanding these considerations, the jury, in Robert's case, did not express any solicitude to save his life as they had done that of James. They found him guilty of being art and part in the forcible abduction of Jean Key from her own dwelling.* ...|$|E
