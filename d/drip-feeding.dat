50|$|Keeping MSUD {{under control}} {{requires}} careful monitoring of blood chemistry, {{both at home}} and in a hospital setting. DNPH or specialised dipsticks may be used to test the patient's urine for ketones (a sign of metabolic decompensation), when metabolic stress is likely or suspected. Fingerstick tests are performed regularly and sent to a laboratory to determine blood levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Regular metabolic consultations, including blood-draws for full nutritional analysis, are recommended; especially during puberty and periods of rapid growth. MSUD management also involves a specially tailored metabolic formula, a modified diet, and lifestyle precautions such as avoiding fatigue and infections, as well as consuming regular, sufficient calories in proportion to physical stress and exertion. Without sufficient calories, catabolism of muscle protein will result in metabolic crisis. Those with MSUD must be hospitalised for intravenous infusion of sugars and nasogastric <b>drip-feeding</b> of formula, in the event of metabolic decompensation, or anorexia, diarrhea or vomiting. Food avoidance, rejection of formula and picky eating are all common problems with MSUD. Some patients may need to receive all or part of their daily nutrition through a feeding tube.|$|E
40|$|A 72 -year-old woman {{without any}} medical and {{psychiatric}} history, suffered from nausea, {{pain in the}} epigastria and constipation for over a year. She eventually lost 20 kilograms despite nightly <b>drip-feeding.</b> Extensive additional tests did not reveal any clues for her complaints. She remained convinced that her symptoms were a side-effect of anti-fungal medication she used. She was diagnosed with hypochondria. In {{the course of time}} her ideas about her somatic symptoms became delusional and she was diagnosed with a hypochondriacal delusion as part of melancholia, without depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure as prominent features. It is important to recognize melancholia as soon as possible by continually evaluating other symptoms of depression. This may enable to avoid repetitive and exhaustive somatic examinations, which are not indicated, and to start effective treatment.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} paper {{deals with}} the development of obstetrics since the very beginnings when all connected with birthgiving was tinged with something "mysterious, empirical up to the present day when obstetrics is grounded on many facts. The care for the birthgiving woman is continuously innovated. First, the birthgiving woman was taken care of by older women of her family who had already given birth to their children and had therefore experience they could pass further. Nowadays it is the midwives who take care of the woman during her delivery. As well as in the past women close to the birthgiving woman the midwives are with the woman and they try to make the delivery easier for her. The development is still progressing but there is still the fact that a delivery is a situation when health is at stake, for both the newborn and the woman. The survey aimed at drawing an outline of the development of the care provided to the birthgiving woman. The methodology of the paper is a semi conducted interview. The first variant of the interview was prepared for woman who gave birth 50 years ago, 20 - 25 years ago and for woman who gave birth 7 years ago. The second variant was prepared for midwives without the difference of age. When interviewing women having given birth 20 - 25 years ago I was very surprised by their unified opinion. They agreed {{on the fact that the}} care for them and the attitude of the medical personal was inadequate to them. They were very malcontent. Mostly they complain about the first stage, when they had to lie on the bed, mostly with a <b>drip-feeding.</b> On the other hand women having given birth 50 years ago were satisfied with the care they had during their delivery. The greatest satisfaction is however declared by women who gave birth 7 years ago, who consider the medical personnel obliging and regardful. Especially they speak about the possibility of movement which was not allowed to women 20 years ago. The interviews with midwifes confirm that the development in obstetrics is progressing. Midwives who entered their employment after 1990 claim that competencies are increasing while older midwives claim the contrary, they say that at the beginning of their carreer their competences were greater than they are today. However all midwives agree that women nowadays are more informed on delivery than they used to be. Unfortunately, they are sometimes overinformed so that they do not know what to choose. Therefore the midwives recommend prenatal courses organised by the materninty clinic where it is the midwife of the particular clinic who informs women on possibilities and procedures which are recommended and carried out at the clinic. The survey has therefore shown, that the care for birthgiving woman is improving. And women are very satisfied at present...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 10 {{percent of}} all {{radioactive}} wastes produced in the U. S. are mixed with hazardous or toxic chemicals and therefore can not be placed in secure land disposal facilities. Mixed wastes containing hazardous organic chemicals are often incinerated, but volatile radioactive elements are released directly into the biosphere. Some mixed wastes do not currently have any identified disposal option and are stored locally awaiting new developments. Biological treatment has been proposed as a potentially safer alternative to incineration {{for the treatment of}} hazardous organic mixed wastes, since biological treatment would not release volatile radioisotopes and the residual low-level radioactive waste would no longer be restricted from land disposal. Prior studies have shown that toxicity associated with acetonitrile is a significant limiting factor for the application of biotreatment to mixed wastes and excessive dilution was required to avoid inhibition of biological treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel reactor configuration, where the concentrated toxic waste is drip-fed into a complete-mix bioreactor containing a pre-concentrated active microbial population, can be used to treat a surrogate acetonitrile mixed waste stream without excessive dilution. Using a <b>drip-feed</b> bioreactor, we were able to treat a 90, 000 mg/L acetonitrile solution to less than 0. 1 mg/L final concentration using a dilution factor of only 3. 4. It was determined that the acetonitrile degradation reaction was inhibited at a pH above 7. 2 and that the reactor could be modeled using conventional kinetic and mass balance approaches.

50|$|Mongolian gerbils {{prefer to}} live in pairs or groups rather than alone. They are social and gentle, and do not bite readily. As diggers and tunnel-makers they are better suited to a tank with a deep {{substrate}} rather than a hamster cage, since the absorbent substrate is liable to be kicked {{up and out of}} a cage pretty quickly. Gerbils are also chewers and need plenty of cardboard items and chew toys. Cardboard will be chewed up into bedding and mixed with the substrate. Gerbils do not need fresh food and indeed it can give them diarrhea, a diet based on a seed, millet and alfalfa pellet mix is sufficient. Water should be provided in a <b>drip-feed</b> system to prevent the accidental build-up of harmful molds in the tank environment. Although gerbils are desert-adapted, they do require water to be supplied at all times. Care should be taken not to introduce new smells suddenly into the tank, which is considered by the gerbils to be their territory. Gerbils are active and appreciate a running or exercise wheel. Repetitive corner digging can be minimized by providing tunnels while gerbils are in their formative months.

40|$|We {{present a}} scheme below {{in which the}} most common forms of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the respiratory tract, notably atopic and non-atopic asthma and COPD, are depicted as separate offshoots from a common ‘at-risk’ pathway underpinned by genotypes related to aberrations in control of host defence and tissue repair mechanisms. We propose that entrance into this pathway is initially programmed by environmental experience during infancy and early childhood, in particular by severe lower respiratory tract infection, and that further progression towards expression of specific disease phenotype(s) {{is determined by the}} nature, timing and frequency of additional environmental insults subsequently encountered. At the one extreme, early sensitization of at-risk subjects to aeroallergens can potentially drive rapid progression towards expression of the atopic asthmatic phenotype under the dual onslaught of inflammatory responses to allergens/pathogens. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum the <b>drip-feed</b> effects of occasional infections on respiratory function(s) are amplified over a longer time frame by inflammation resulting from exposure to tobacco smoke and/or related chemical pollutants. Non-atopic asthma is envisaged to fit between these two extremes, being driven essentially by the downstream effects of respiratory infections alone in at-risk subjects. An important common factor in all three disease phenotypes is that acute exacerbations are typically driven by infections, the host responses to which display a characteristic T-helper type 2 -like footprint, which in our view points to underlying genotype(s) which result in unbalanced host responses to respiratory pathogens...|$|R

What went wrong, why expectations were falsely high and how micro-finance can become sustainable were the key topics of a CTA study visit to South Africa in October and November 2000.

During visits with their South African peers, they studied the often confused transition of community organisations into caring local banks, lending where commercial banks did not dare tread.

Patients were separated in 2 main (33 and 34 patients) and control (34 patients) groups depending on CRT methodology. In the main groups patients underwent conformal RT and HE BT in the first main group they took tegafur (800 mg per day per os) and ciplastin (50 mg 1 time a week, in sum 300 mg <b>drip-feed).</b> In the control group 34 patients underwent conventional remote RT and BT by the sources of mean radiation dose (MRD) activity. Results. In patients of the main groups was detected an increase of regression of cervical tumors: the complete regression (CR) was registered in 10 (30, 3 %) patients from the 1 -st main group, in 7 (20, 6 %) patients from the 2 main group and in 5 (14, 7 %) patients of the control group. The partial regression (PR) of tumor – in 20 (60, 6 %) patients of the 1 -st main group, in 18 (52, 9 %) patients of the 2 main group and in 15 (44, 1 %) patients of the control group. Conclusion. The use of cytostatic preparations (tegafur, ciplastin) as radiomodifiers during CRT course in patients of the main groups reliably increase the degree of cervical carcinoma regression comparing with the standard methodology of CRT, it does not cause an increase of frequency and manifestations of the general and local toxicity of treatment </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{his article}} from The Conversation website, Bruce Littleboy writes about {{economic}} forecasts, their effects and their accuracy.. Does the finance industry rely {{too heavily on}} contestable economic data? AAP People who work in business and finance are obsessed with economic data releases – GDP growth figures, unemployment rates, trade statistics, and so on. Business journalists, investors, financial analysts, traders and bankers subsist on the <b>drip-feed</b> of data that flows each week from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Reserve Bank (RBA), and research institutes. All this information affects the confidence and behaviour of these players, and by extension, has serious implications for {{the direction of the}} economy – so there’s good reason to take it all seriously. But how much should we rely on data, given that much of it is revised later? Last week’s GPD data release from the ABS offers a case in point. Treasurer Wayne Swan complained that some in the media were wailing about an impending recession when the previous quarter’s flood-affected figures were published. The June quarter figures show a bounce-back of 1. 2 %, and some of the pundits now claim that the result is so strong that a boom is on the way and the RBA will raise interest rates. I don’t see what any of the fuss is about. Growth contracted in the floods, and then output returned to normal afterwards. A boost to inventories may simply be replenishing the stocks run down during and following these floods. When you are sick in bed, your output falls. When you get better and go back to work, you get a strong growth pick-up simply from the low base. It’s a cliche that one shouldn’t read too much into a single GDP figure – revisions are frequent. The March quarter decline was itself reduced. Treasury recently published a paper about the perils of forecasting in tumultuous times. Take a look at this chart from the report – particularly the differences between first published outcomes and the later ones. Apparently floods can be tricky for forecasters too. We don’t need to go through the old commentator’s songbook about how spikes in food prices may cause the RBA to raise interest rates to keep inflation on target. By now we know that the RBA ignores these sporadically volatile components of the CPI. Screen jockeys, as day traders are known in the industry, gasp at the latest statistical releases and draw all kinds of wild conclusions. These pros (of whom I am not one) try to think a bit quicker than the herd and make some money at their expense. Those who leapt to the premature conclusion that interest rates would over the past few months, on the back of strong data, have already paid too much for something or sold something for too little. Only luck can save them now. Sober decision-makers striving to take a longer view (of whom, again, I am not one) form judgements based on a reading of wider set of indicators. Take a look at capacity utilisation in the RBA’s Chart Pack, which is steady but maybe still a bit low. This would corroborate the story that we are around the output figure consistent with stable underlying inflation. Remembering that the floods would have destroyed some capacity to produce, the low-ish tally of four quarters of growth may be consistent with demand and supply growing apace. Another trap is to put too much weight on news stories. For example, job losses in manufacturing are pretty normal. The manufacturing sector has declined steadily by a third over the last 35 years. It’s not easy to disentangle cyclical fluctuations from remorseless trends. It also helps to predict interest rates changes if you try to see the world {{through the eyes of the}} central bankers. Our RBA officials frequently give revealing hints in their speeches. One very interesting hint is the commonly expressed idea that the RBA does more than set interest rates in the light of keeping inflation within the band. If they regard interest rates as abnormally low (this supposedly has damaging longer-term effects on saving and investment), they’ll inch them up anyway if the chance arises. Of course the problem now is deciding what can be regarded as “normal” in such abnormal times, especially in the light of such low interest rates elsewhere. All of this makes the process of interpreting data rather fraught. Breaking from the pack is even more difficult – as John Maynard Keynes said, ‘… it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally. " Nobody loves someone who tells everybody they are all wrong, especially when this person is proved correct by events. So we continue to sing in chorus. It’s also true that errors are forgotten in the cacophony of chatter. Nobody will remember if any of us armchair analysts is right or wrong.   This article was originally published at The Conversation. Read the original article...|$|R
