Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning.

40|$|Discussion of {{cinematic}} affect most typically attends to response, {{the impact}} of the film as we experience it. In this vein, various writers have drawn attention to the physicality of hearing (Sobchack 2005; Cubitt 1998), while others have illuminated the ways in which sound communicates sensory information about the film world (Altman 1992; Chion 1994). However, attention to practice offers further opportunities to think about affect, that decisions made by sound practitioners take into account such considerations; sound practitioners frequently speak about their work in terms of <b>feel,</b> <b>texture</b> and experience. Moreover, the processes of creating film sound requires physical activity and involvement, play and experimentation, which might be literally physical, or have a kind of tactile analogy (to weaving, sculpting and so on). In this sense, affect is in the labour of making the film, as well as in our watching of it. Bringing together theory and practice therefore offers an opportunity to more fully develop an account of the particular contributions of sound to cinematic affect, and perhaps illuminate the significance of practitioners work to the sensory appeal of film more generally – highlighting the creative effort of those filmmakers who traditionally receive less recognition for their achievements. Drawing on published and unpublished interviews with film sound personnel, this article will seek to show how a connection between theory and practice enables a deeper comprehension of filmic affect, traced through the embodied and empathetic qualities of sound work.

40|$|Abstract: Yoghurt {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{fermented}} dairy products widely consumed all over the world. In majority of the countries, the increase in the per capita annual consumption of yoghurt has been attributed to both the ever-increasing availability of fruit or flavoured yoghurt and to the diversity of presentations of the product. This study was conducted to develop a value added set type fruit yoghurt with the acceptable combination of milk and ripened jack fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lain). Various levels of jack fruit chunks (3 - 5 mm) viz. 3, 5, and 7 percentages (w/v) were used in the preparation of fruit yoghurt. On the basis of various sensory attributes, yoghurt containing 5 % jack fruit chunks was selected as optimum. Selected yoghurt sample from sensory panel and control (Plain yoghurt) were analysed for proximate composition, E. coli count, shelf life and sensory attributes such as appearance, aroma, colour, fruit distribution, mouth <b>feel,</b> <b>texture,</b> taste, overall acceptability.

40|$|TAGs play an {{important}} role in determining the functional properties of fat-based food products such as margarines, chocolate, and spreads. Nowadays, special attention is given to the role of the TAG structure and how it affects functional properties such as mouth <b>feel,</b> <b>texture,</b> and plasticity. Key to this research is the need to develop more healthy fats with a reduced level of trans and saturated fatty acids (SFAs), while maintaining the desired properties. In this study, fat blends with identical levels of SFA (50 %) but differing in the ratio asymmetric/symmetric blends were evaluated by pulsed NMR and texturometry as a function of storage time and storage temperature. A higher trisaturated TAG content gave rise to a higher solid fat content (SFC) at higher temperature and a lower SFC at lower temperature for both palmitic and stearic based blends. On the other hand, the effect of symmetry on the SFC-profile of the blends was only clear for the stearic based blends. At lower temperatures, the SFC of symmetric TAG based blend (blend SM) was markedly lower than that of asymmetric TAG based blend (blend iS). However, from 30 degrees C onwards, the SFC of blend SM was clearly higher than that of blend iS. The microscopic analyses revealed a denser crystal network for a higher degree of trisaturated TAG and for symmetric stearic based blends. Moreover, some blends showed a clear evolution of the microstructure during storage with smaller crystals transforming into larger ones. Finally, texture analyses demonstrated the importance of the crystallization and storage temperature on the hardness of the blends...|$|E

40|$|Macroscopic {{properties}} such as mouth <b>feel,</b> <b>texture</b> {{and stability}} are important quality attributes of liver paste, determining consumer acceptance. Liver paste typically contains {{a significant amount}} of liver (proteins) and adipose tissue or lard and their functional behaviour is expected to be important for the macroscopic properties of this product. This research focused on understanding the mechanisms determining the macroscopic properties of liver paste. Not only the physicochemical characteristics of the constituents but also the microstructure of liver paste were studied. Knowledge of their respective relation to the macroscopic properties is important in maintaining or optimizing the quality of this product and in the development of new products (e. g. clean label products). In a first chapter, the macroscopic characteristics of liver paste (emulsion stability, texture and mouth feel) were studied, whereby the effect of liver/fat ratio (35 / 35 and 20 / 50) and salt (0 and 1. 8 %) was investigated. As the liver/fat ratio decreased, the fat binding properties decreased while the creaminess perception increased. The hardness, however, was not influenced by the liver/fat ratio. Salt increased the fat binding properties and hardness of liver paste and resulted in a less spreadable liver paste. The second chapter studied the microstructure of liver paste by means of rheology and light microscopy and the relationship with the macroscopic properties. The rheological properties of the intermediates (liver batter and liver paste batter) were also studied in order to understand how the structure of liver paste is formed during liver paste processing. For the conventional liver paste (35 / 35, 1. 8 % salt), it was shown that liver proteins were present in the continuous phase and that the fat globules were surrounded by a protein layer. Both intermediates and liver paste were characterized as weak gel-like emulsions with the elastic modulus (G&# 8242;) higher than the viscous modulus (G&# 8243;). G&# 8242; and G&# 8243; of liver paste were higher in magnitude compared with both intermediates which shows that structure building occurred during pasteurization and cooling: the more pourable liquid-like liver paste batter is converted to a more solid-like spreadable liver paste. This structure building is caused by a combination of fat crystallization and protein denaturation and aggregation. Generally, the values of the viscoelastic parameters of liver paste batter and liver paste increased with the addition of salt. With salt, a stronger and more stable liver paste was obtained which may be attributed to solubilisation of salt soluble liver proteins, making them more available to act as emulsifier. Salt however affected the viscoelastic properties of liver batter in the opposite way: a weaker structure was formed with salt. A microstructure with smaller fat globules was obtained with the addition of salt, explaining the increased hardness and fat binding properties. A higher liver/fat ratio (35 / 35 versus 20 / 50) only increased the viscoelasticproperties of liver paste batter while liver paste was not affected. This might be attributed to the crystallization of the fat in the liver paste with a high fat/liver ratio, which besides the structural potential of liver proteins, also aids to structure building of liver paste. However, a higher liver/fat ratio did increase the linear viscoelastic region in both liver paste batter and liver paste, indicating that the structural contribution of liver proteins is more stress resistant than the structure generated by fat crystallization. The micrographs showed a heterogeneous structure with bigger fat globules and fat channels with a decrease in the liver/fat ratio, causing decreased fat binding properties. Next, the functional properties of liver protein fractions were investigated and compared to commercial protein ingredients (sodium caseinate, porcine globin and porcine albumin). Their emulsifying, gelling and foaming properties as well as their molecular weight distribution and surface hydrophobicity were studied. Two protein fractions were characterized: water soluble (WSLP) and water+salt soluble liver proteins (W+SSLP) (= salt soluble liver proteins (SSLP) in the presence of WSLP). The effect of different salt concentrations was also investigated (0, 1. 8 and 3. 4 % NaCl). Both WSLP and W+SSLP displayed good emulsifying properties while their gelling properties were rather weak. An increase in salt concentration decreased the emulsifying properties of WSLP while the effect on W+SSLP was less pronounced. The gel forming ability of W+SSLP containing 0 % was higher compared to this at high salt concentrations, probably due to a stronger intermolecular network of non-solubilized myofilaments compared to the network formed of more solubilized myofibrillar proteins at high salt concentrations. The same conclusions could be drawn for the WSLP, indicating that with phosphate solution also myofibrillar fragments were extracted as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. Higher salt concentrations shifted the gel temperature of both WSLP and W+SSLP to lower temperatures. No relation could be found for the effect of salt between the functional properties of liver proteins in model systems and the microstructure and macroscopic properties in liver paste. In the last chapter of this research, differential scanning calorimetry and real-time X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation were used to study the isothermal crystallization formation mechanism of lard at 18, 20, 22 and 24 &# 176;C. At 18 &# 176;C, lard crystallized in three steps. A potential mechanism for these three steps was proposed. In the first step, part of the melt (the trisaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs)) crystallized in alfa crystals adopting a double length structure (2 L), while the second step consisted of a polymorphic transition of these 2 Lalfa crystals to ß crystals with a triple length structure (3 L). Extra 3 Lß crystals consisting of monounsaturated TAGs were also formed directly from the melt. In the third and last step, ß crystals were formed due to a second polymorphic transition of trisaturated 3 Lß crystals to ß crystals adopting a 2 L structure. Above a cut-off temperature of 20 &# 176;C lard crystallized in two steps: no formation of alfa crystals could be observed and 3 Lß crystals (trisaturated and monounsaturated TAGs) were formed directly from the melt. This proposed mechanism implies that lard crystallization is characterized by an overlap of fractionated crystallization and polymorphic transitions. The results obtained in this work showed more insight in the microstructure and macroscopic properties of liver paste. In addition, it was demonstrated that liver paste is mainly stabilized by liver proteins surrounding fat globules. Correlation of the functional behaviour of the constituents studied in model systems compared to liver paste was however not evident. nrpages: 145 status: publishe...|$|E
