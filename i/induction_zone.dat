How the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> affects finger location and spacing is unknown. In the moist subsoil, fingers may well dissipate because the finger tips {{no longer have}} to overcome the water entry value. Both flow regions were investigated in a two-dimensional chamber with a fine-over-coarse glass bead porous medium. A capillary fringe was created by upward wetting through capillary rise. Upon ponding with dye-coloured water, fingers emerged, propagated downward and diverged when reaching the capillary fringe. Microtensiometers were installed in the <b>induction</b> <b>zone,</b> the fingers, and in the capillary fringe. In the <b>induction</b> <b>zone,</b> a lateral sinusoidal pressure head developed within minutes. Only in one of two experiments could the observed pressure head pattern be satisfactorily reproduced by a steady-state model assuming uniform <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> properties and uniform infiltration. Later, fingers emerged below the pressure head minima. The <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> did not affect finger properties. The pressure head in the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> was determined by the depth of the finger tips. The water requirement of the fingers dictated the lateral pressure head gradients.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} one-dimensional pulsating detonations were studied numerically using a simple two-step chain branching model with separate induction and exothermic reaction zones. The stability boundary {{was found for}} a wide range of non-dimensional activation energy and heat release. The wave dynamics within the detonation structure responsible for non-linear pulsating instability were studied using the three families of characteristic curves on x-t diagrams, representing the trajectories of pressure waves and particle paths. This clarified the dynamics responsible for loss of stability and the period of the pulsating instability. Four main regimes of pulsations were observed: the high frequency, very high frequency, low frequency and transition regimes. The high and very high frequency modes tend to manifest itself for low values of activation energy, while the low frequency mode tends to appear for higher activation energy. The very high frequency pulsations are governed by a cycle of expansion waves traveling across the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> along the C- characteristics coupled with the compression waves traveling across the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> along the C+ characteristics. The high frequency pulsations are controlled by a coupling between the particle path originating from the leading shock traveling across the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> and the compression wave traveling across the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> via the C+ characteristics. The low frequency oscillations involve the C- characteristics or particle paths traveling across the entire detonation from the shock followed by the C+ characteristics traveling toward the leading shock. The mechanisms governing the pulsating instability and the periods of oscillation were found to be in good qualitative agreement with Toong's phenomenological model based on the wave dynamics in a square wave model...|$|E

40|$|Multidimensional {{time-dependent}} numerical simulations {{have been}} used to study the initiation, propagation, and extinction of detonations in gases and liquids. The simulations, which calculate the detailed behavior of the interacting shock waves and reaction zones forming the detonation wave, are used to study the evolution of the instability that leads to the cellular structure of detonations. The simulations consist of two-dimensional time-dependent solutions of the convection of mass density, momentum density and energy coupled to models for chemical energy release. The convective transport equations are solved by the Flux-Corrected Transport algorithm. The chemical reactions and energy release are usually modelled by the two-step induction parameter model. We conclude that the behavior of the multidimensional structure of a detonation depends on the differences of the thermodynamic properties in the <b>induction</b> <b>zones</b> behind the Mach stem and the incident shock. The formation of unreacted pockets behind the detonation front depends on the inclination of the transverse waves and the curvature of the shock fronts.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two dynamic {{parameters of}} gaseous detonations, critical energy and cell size. The first part {{is concerned with}} the direct initiation of gaseous detonations by a blast wave and the associated critical energy. Numerical simulations of the spherically symmetric direct initiation event with a simple chemical reaction model are presented. Local analysis of the computed unsteady reaction zone structure identifies a competition between heat release rate, front curvature and unsteadiness. The primary failure mechanism is found to be unsteadiness in the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> arising from the deceleration of the shock front. On this basis, simplifying assumptions are applied to the governing equations, permitting solution of an analytical model for the critical shock decay rate. The local analysis is validated by integration of reaction zone structure equations with detailed chemical kinetics and prescribed unsteadiness. The model is then applied to the global initiation problem to produce an analytical equation for the critical energy. Unlike previous phenomenological models, this equation is not dependent on other experimentally determined parameters.

As part of this study, an initiator that creates a large-aspect-ratio planar detonation wave in gas-phase explosive from a single ignition point has also been developed.

Radius {{hardening}} on {{journals of}} forged steel Diesel engine crankshafts is performed {{in order to}} increase fatigue life characteristics. This requirement may be necessary if the demands for engine power are to be increased, but where the existing crankshaft design is close to its fatigue limit, such that an increase in loading will cause it to'fail. Induction hardening of journal radii changes the make-up of the material from a coarse to a fine crystalline structure which alters the features of crack propagation. As a consequence of this higher loads can be applied onto the crankshaft without ultimately resulting in catastrophic material failure. Extending the <b>induction</b> hardened <b>zone</b> from the bearing surfaces into the radii of journals, culminates in process difficulties which are not experienced in non-radius hardened Hardening of journal radii induces crankshafts. as well as releases stresses in the crankshaft webs. This results in a deformation of the crankshaft which can be measured in the form of journal runout. Such a problem cannot be overcome by straightening the crankshafts in order to reduce runout, since this will cause Straightening hand induces the radii to crack once hardened. in the unhardened state on the other stresses which will be released again after hardening. This results in an increase in runout. High runout indicates that stresses have been induced into the crankshaft material. This is undesirable since this will make critical manufacturing processes such as grinding, governing of journal lengths, uncontrollable. It can furthermore result in creep of the crankshaft long after the manufacturing date. This results in crankshaft deformation, noticeable through an increase in runout. Since the crankshaft cannot be straightened after hardening, the consequence is that it will be unusable. The process must therefore be developed in such a manner, that all variables which can contribute towards stress induction resulting in journal 'runout, must be investigated and resolved...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} on {{numerical}} simulations {{of the evolution of}} gaseous detonation waves in mixtures that contain chemical inhibitors. In general, these are compounds that consume the radicals that are produced during combustion, thereby inhibiting the exothermic chain-terminating reaction. Also, some of them participate in endothermic reactions, such as dissociation. These properties make them very efficient flame suppressants. In this study, we employ a chemical kinetics model that consists of a three-step chain-branching mechanism for the fuel combustion and a one-step mechanism for the reaction between inhibitor and radicals. Results from both one- and two-dimensional simulations are presented and discussed. It is shown that radical consumption and heat absorption due to the inhibitor's reaction result in longer induction zones. This, in turn, leads to a detachment of the reaction zone from the precursor shock. For small and medium inhibitor concentrations, this detachment is temporary. Eventually, the radical concentration behind the <b>induction</b> <b>zone</b> becomes sufficient to initiate rapid fuel consumption, thus producing pressure waves which reach the precursor shock and re-ignite the detonation. This is followed by large over-pressures and highly irregular oscillations of the shock. Nonetheless, sufficiently high inhibitor concentrations can yield permanent detonation quenching...|$|E
40|$|Peptide {{signaling}} presumably {{occupies a}} central role in plant development, yet only few concrete examples of receptor-ligand pairs that act in the context of specific differentiation processes have been described. Here we report that second-site null mutations in the Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase gene barely any meristem 3 (BAM 3) perfectly suppress the postembryonic root meristem growth defect and the associated perturbed protophloem development of the brevis radix (brx) mutant. The roots of bam 3 mutants specifically resist growth inhibition by the CLAVATA 3 /ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION 45 (CLE 45) peptide ligand. WT plants transformed with a construct for ectopic overexpression of CLE 45 could not be recovered, {{with the exception of a}} single severely dwarfed and sterile plant that eventually died. By contrast, we obtained numerous transgenic bam 3 mutants transformed with the same construct. These transgenic plants displayed a WT phenotype, however, supporting the notion that CLE 45 is the likely BAM 3 ligand. The results correlate with the observation that external CLE 45 application represses protophloem differentiation in WT, but not in bam 3 mutants. BAM 3, BRX, and CLE 45 are expressed in a similar spatiotemporal trend along the developing protophloem, up to the end of the transition <b>zone.</b> <b>Induction</b> of BAM 3 expression upon CLE 45 application, ectopic overexpression of BAM 3 in brx root meristems, and laser ablation experiments suggest that intertwined regulatory activity of BRX, BAM 3, and CLE 45 could be involved in the proper transition of protophloem cells from proliferation to differentiation, thereby impinging on postembryonic growth capacity of the root meristem...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The Wnt pathway has {{previously}} been shown {{to play a role}} in hepatic zonation. Herein, we have explored the role of 3 key components (Apc, β-catenin, and c-Myc) of the Wnt pathway in the zonation of ammonia metabolizing enzymes. Methods: Conditional deletion of Apc, β-catenin, and c-Myc was induced in the livers of mice and the expression of periportal and perivenous hepatocyte markers was determined by polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical techniques. Results: Under normal circumstances, the urea cycle enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPS I) is present in the periportal, intermediate, and the first few layers of the perivenous zone. In contrast, glutamine synthetase (GS) —and nuclear β-catenin—is expressed in a complementary fashion in the last 1 – 2 cell layers of the perivenous zone. Conditional loss of Apc resulted in the expression of nuclear β-catenin and GS in most hepatocytes irrespective of <b>zone.</b> <b>Induction</b> of GS in hepatocytes outside the normal perivenous zone was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of CPS I. Deletion of β-catenin induces a loss of GS and a complementary increase in expression of CPS I irrespective of whether Apc is present. Remarkably, deletion of c-Myc did not perturb the pattern of zonation. Conclusions: It has been shown that the Wnt pathway is key to imposing the pattern of zonation within the liver. Herein we have addressed the relevance of 3 major Wnt pathway components and show critically that the zonation is c-Myc independent but β-catenin dependent...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. More {{than before}} {{there is a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the role of the}} school principal in improving instruction and learning as illustrated by research on school effectiveness (Everard, Morris& Smith, 1990 : 88). However, a striking aspect of efforts made to improve the managerial capabilities of school principals is the neglect of the unique needs for school principals. Therefore, the Education Action Zones team found that there was indeed a high sense of awareness of the need to improve learners' performance in the Grade 12 level, through the induction of principals for effective curriculum management and leadership (Nunn, 2000 : 1) According to Duke (1991 : 271) only four of 45 principals have received formal orientation to their positions in USA. Without formal orientation principals soon begin to discover administration. So the visits by the EAZ team to the schools may contribute in improving them through inducting principals (Nunn, 2000 : 1). The Education Action Zone's intervention strategy has identified that schools have problems that they are unable to analyse. Subsequently the EAZ team was instructed to identify key problem areas that could be attended to in a short period of time through inducting principals (Thembela & Walters, 1997 : 114). Unlike several European countries, such as Sweden - and most North American jurisdictions that require formal managerial preparation for principalship prior to appointment, it is not the case in South Africa (Foster, Smith & Thurlow, 1997 : 32). The lack of appropriate induction mechanisms have had a negative impact on the schooling system as Hart and Welding, (1996 : 309) explain. Education management is both a complex and continuously changing undertaking, for this reason managers cannot be well prepared for the task "once and for all". Changing contexts, changingexpectations and new knowledge about best leadership practices all provide a warrant for considerable investment in the continuing professional development of education managers (Hallinger, 1998 : 201). Professional development through an induction strategy of education managers enables principals to create relationships with the community, the district and their colleagues. However it is an administrative responsibility that is often neglected or loosely organised in many school districts (Rebore, 1991 : 36). The Education Action Zones intervention strategy has identified that social contracts could be drawn up between parents and the school to enhance this relationship (Nunn, 2000 : 5). The industrial and business communities place higher priority on induction, they have recognised for many years the course and relationship of this process to employee retention and job performance whereas in the education department induction is neglected (Thembele & Walters, 1997 : 114). The induction of principals should not be neglected because a school system can recruit, select, assign, reassign and transfer personnel but until these individuals become fully adjusted to the work to be performed, they cannot be expected to give their best effort to obtain the goals of the institution (Castetter; 1990 : 260). To attain goals of the institution the principal must be able to adapt and fit in without abandoning his/her principles (Theron & Bothma, 1990 : 36). In view of the foregoing the Education Action Zone's intervention strategy of inducting principals for curriculum management - and leadership is of utmost importance. The aims of this research are to: explore the nature of the Education Action <b>Zone's</b> <b>induction</b> strategy for principals, examine the perception of principals with regard to Education Action <b>Zone's</b> <b>induction</b> strategy and develop strategies that can be used to induct principals...|$|R
