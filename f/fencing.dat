40|$|<b>Fences</b> are {{instructions}} that programmers or compilers insert {{in the code}} to prevent the compiler or the hardware from reordering memory accesses [20, 43]. <b>Fences</b> can be expensive {{because all of the}} accesses before the <b>fence</b> have to be finished (i. e., the loads have to be retired and the writes drained from the write buffer) before any access after the <b>fence</b> can be observed by any other processor. This thesis seeks to reduce the <b>fence</b> overhead in relaxed-consistency machines. It first introduces the WeeFence, a <b>fence</b> that is very cheap because it allows post-fence accesses to skip it. Such accesses can typically complete and retire before the pre-fence writes have drained from the write buffer. Only when an incorrect reordering of accesses is about to happen, does the hardware stall to prevent it. WeeFence presents implementation difficulties due to its reliance on global state and structures. This thesis then introduces the Unbalanced <b>Fence,</b> which can optimize both the performance and the imple-mentability of <b>fences.</b> Unbalanced <b>Fence</b> starts off with a design likeWeeFence but without the global state, which is called Weak <b>Fence.</b> Since the concurrent execution of multiple Weak <b>Fences</b> induces deadlock, a Weak <b>Fence</b> is combined {{with the use of a}} conventional <b>fence</b> (i. e., Strong <b>Fence)</b> for the less performance-critical threads. The result is called Unbalanced <b>fence</b> groups. Unbalanced <b>fences</b> are substantially easie...|$|R

40|$|Traditional memory <b>fences</b> are program-counter (PC) based. That is, {{a memory}} <b>fence</b> enforces a {{serialization}} {{point in the}} program instruction stream — it ensures that all memory references before the <b>fence</b> in the program order have taken effect before the execution continues onto instructions after the <b>fence.</b> Such PC-based memory <b>fences</b> always cause the processor to stall, even when the synchronization is unnecessary during a particular execution. We propose the concept of location-based memory <b>fences,</b> which aim {{to reduce the cost}} of synchronization due to the latency of memory <b>fence</b> execution in parallel algorithms. Unlike a PC-based memory <b>fence,</b> a location-based memory <b>fence</b> serializes the instruction stream of the executing thread T 1 only when a different thread T 2 attempts to read the memory location which is guarded by the location-based memory <b>fence.</b> In this work, we describe a hardware mechanism for location-based memory <b>fences,</b> prove its correctness, and evaluate its potential performance benefit. Our experimental results are based on a software simulation of the proposed location-based memory <b>fence,</b> which incurs higher overhead than the proposed hardware mechanism would. Even though applications using the software prototype implementation do not scale as well compared to the traditional memmory <b>fences</b> due to the software overhead, our experiments show that applications can benefit from using location-based memory <b>fences.</b> These results suggest that a hardware support for locationbased memory <b>fences</b> is worth considering...|$|R
