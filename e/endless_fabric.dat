5000|$|In a Van de Graaff generator, {{invented in}} 1929 by Robert J. Van de Graaff, an <b>endless</b> <b>fabric</b> belt carries {{electric}} charge into a round hollow electrode, developing high voltages. In the Westinghouse machine, two belts traveled up a 47 ft. shaft to a mushroom-shaped electrode inside the dome (see cutaway drawing below). The high voltage {{was used to}} accelerate subatomic particles to high speeds as they traveled down an evacuated 47 ft. accelerator tube parallel to the belts into {{the base of the}} machine, where they struck a target to create nuclear reactions. The energy of the particles was equal to the voltage on the machine's electrode. The maximum voltage that a Van de Graaff generator could produce was limited by leakage of the charge off the electrode due to corona discharge and arcing. At atmospheric pressure, a Van de Graaff machine was limited to around 1 megavolt. So the machine was installed inside a pear-shaped 65 ft. tall, 30 ft. diameter air tank which was pressurized during use to 120 pounds per square inch. [...] The high pressure air improved insulation, reducing charge leakage, allowing the machine to achieve a voltage of 5 megavolts, although it was originally hoped to reach 10 megavolts.|$|E
40|$|THE last {{opinion of}} Benjamin Nathan Cardozo {{has taken its}} place in the Reports. His {{contribution}} to the <b>endless</b> <b>fabric</b> through which the law is shaped {{to the needs of the}} land is done. There is nothing that he can add or subtract from a miscellany of utterance scattered across the pages of many legal volumes. The record is complete and closed; 2 Ì† 7 yet it is impossible to assess the exact quality of his work or with certainty to assign his place in the great tradition. For in his decisions a jurist offers only one of the elements out of which a judgment upon him is to be distilled. The great web of the law gives character to his accomplishment; and, as the future sets its pattern, provides the perspective against which his craft is defined. The jurist performs; and the law and posterity give worth to his contribution. He can only do and abide the event...|$|E
