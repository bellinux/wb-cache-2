50|$|The VSIV G protein {{has also}} been used in cytological studies of {{trafficking}} in the endomembrane system. Immunoelectron microscopy suggests that VSIV G protein moves from cis to trans <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> without being transported between them in vesicles, supporting the cisternal maturation model of Golgi trafficking.|$|E
50|$|After a peptide of {{high enough}} {{affinity}} has bonded {{to the class}} I MHC, calreticulin, ERp57, TAP, and tapasin release the molecule. At this point the class I complex consists of an HLA-A protein bonded to a β2-microglobulin and a short peptide. It is still anchored in the ER membrane by the transmembrane domain. At some point the ER will receive a signal and {{the portion of the}} membrane holding the complex will bud off and be transported to the <b>golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> for further processing. From the <b>golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> the complex is transported, again via vesicle transport, to the cell membrane. This is {{the point at which the}} orientation mentioned previously becomes important. The portion of the HLA-A complex holding the peptide must be on the exterior surface of the cell membrane. This is accomplished by vesicle fusion with the cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|Cellular {{components}} for Jakoba {{are not particularly}} unique. They contain a single nucleus found close to the flagellar bases, a single <b>Golgi</b> <b>body,</b> and the mitochondrial organelles are flattened.|$|R
50|$|N-glycan {{processing}} {{is carried}} out in endoplasmic reticulum and the <b>Golgi</b> <b>body.</b> Initial trimming of the precursor molecule occurs in the ER and the subsequent processing occurs in the Golgi.|$|R
25|$|The Golgi apparatus, {{also known}} as the <b>Golgi</b> complex, <b>Golgi</b> <b>body,</b> or simply the Golgi, is an {{organelle}} found in most eukaryotic cells. It was identified in 1897 by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi and named after him in 1898.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nucleus of}} the cell lies between the {{anterior}} lobes of the chloroplast in parallel with the pyrenoid, and some species have developed anterior nuclear lobes. [...] The nucleus is centrally located and is parallel with the flagellar depression and pyrenoid. [...] Additionally, condensed chromatin can be viewed in the nucleus of certain species. [...] See figure 1 for nuclear positioning within cells. The Golgi of Tetraselmis species has a distinct number of <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> usually {{within the range of}} 2-4, but species can have up to 8 or more. [...] This is a reliable characteristic that is used to help classify species. [...] <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> lie between the chloroplast and the basal bodies; cis-Golgi face the chloroplast and trans-Golgi face the basal bodies. Mitochondria are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in no pattern. [...] The cytoplasm may contain additional organelles and macromolecules such as lipid droplets, vacuoles, and lysosomes. [...] Additionally, the starch produced by Tetraselmis is the same as those produced from land plants.|$|E
50|$|Mucigel is a slimy {{substance}} {{that covers the}} root cap of the roots of plants. It is a highly hydrated polysaccharide, most likely a pectin, which is secreted from the outermost (epidermal) cells of the rootcap. Mucigel is formed in the <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> of such cells, and is secreted {{through the process of}} exocytosis. The layer of microorganism-rich soil surrounding the mucigel is called the rhizosphere.|$|E
50|$|Although {{classified}} as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei are not characteristically eukaryotic, {{as some of}} them lack histones and nucleosomes, and maintain continually condensed chromosomes during mitosis. The dinoflagellate nucleus was termed ‘mesokaryotic’ by Dodge (1966), due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> mitochondria, and chloroplasts.|$|E
50|$|The general {{shape of}} Aplanochytrium cells can be spherical to ovoid and their {{morphology}} {{is characterized by}} a single nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, numerous tubular mitochondria, a <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> and the presence of electron-dense regions at the periphery of the cell known as bothrosomes.|$|R
40|$|Chemical and radioautographic {{studies on}} {{sycamore}} seedling stems have shown an involve-ment of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> in cell-wall polysaccharide synthesis from tritiated glucose. Tritiated phenylalanine {{is shown to}} be incorporated only into lignin after short incubation times. The patterns of labelling are compared and discussed for the two precursors...|$|R
50|$|The {{symbiotic}} Nephroselmis {{is different}} from free-living species. It retains its cytoplasm, nucleus and plastid, while other organelles including mitochondria, <b>Golgi</b> <b>body,</b> cytoskeleton, and endomembrane system are degraded. The plastid is also comparatively enlarged up to ten times the normal size of free-living species. The enlarged plastid is compensated by reduced cytoplasmic components.|$|R
50|$|It is the {{earliest}} intracellular stage of parasite. It is elongated, slightly curved, microscopic unicellular organism with one end pointed {{and the other}} end blunt. The pellicle, forming external envelope, contains longitudinally arranged contractile microtubules which help in wriggling movements of organism. Cytoplasm includes a vesicular nucleus, a mitochondrion, <b>golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes and vacuoles containing reserve food, etc. Penetration of sporozoite into host epithelial cell is facilitated by the lytic secretion stored in roptries of parasite.|$|E
5000|$|Endothelial NOS (eNOS), {{also known}} as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), generates NO in blood vessels and is {{involved}} with regulating vascular function. The gene coding for eNOS is located on Chromosome 7. A constitutive Ca2+ dependent NOS provides a basal release of NO. eNOS is associated with [...] "caveolae" [...] a component of plasma membranes surrounding cells, and the membranes of <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> within cells. eNOS localisation to endothelial membranes is mediated by cotranslational N-terminal myristoylation and post-translational palmitoylation.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that phlorotannins are first sequestered in physodes under their polar, reactive form before being oxidized and complexed to the alginic acid of brown algla cell wall by a peroxidase. To this date (2012), not much is known about phlorotannins synthesis. The formation of physodes, vesicles containing phenolic compounds, have been investigated for many years. These cytoplasmic constituents {{were thought to be}} synthesized in the chloroplast or its membrane, but more recent studies suggest that the formation {{may be related to the}} endoplasmic reticulum and <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Crystals: Crystalline {{inclusions}} {{have long}} been recognized as normal constituents of certain cell types such as Sertoli cells and Leydig cells of the human testis, and occasionally in macrophages. It is believed that these structures are crystalline forms of certain proteins which is located everywhere in the cell such as in nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, <b>Golgi</b> <b>body,</b> and free in cytoplasmic matrix.|$|R
25|$|Head: It has {{a compact}} nucleus with only {{chromatic}} substance and {{is surrounded by}} only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the acrosome, formed by modification of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> and which secretes enzyme spermlysin (hyaluronidase, corona-penetrating enzyme, zona eyesin, or aerosin.) On {{the surface of the}} head lies a decapcitating substance which is removed before fertilisation.|$|R

50|$|The nucleus is {{surrounded}} by a double membrane (commonly referred to as a nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope), with pores that allow material to move in and out. Various tube- and sheet-like extensions of the nuclear membrane form what is called the endoplasmic reticulum or ER, which is involved in protein transport and maturation. It includes the rough ER where ribosomes are attached to synthesize proteins, which enter the interior space or lumen. Subsequently, they generally enter vesicles, which bud off from the smooth ER. In most eukaryotes, these protein-carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles, called <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> or dictyosomes.|$|E
5000|$|Norwood Russell Hanson, Imre Lakatos and Thomas Kuhn {{have done}} {{extensive}} {{work on the}} [...] "theory laden" [...] character of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation {{is dependent on the}} conceptual framework of the observer, using the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description. He opens Chapter 1 with a discussion of the <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> and their initial rejection as an artefact of staining technique, and a discussion of Brahe and Kepler observing the dawn and seeing a [...] "different" [...] sun rise despite the same physiological phenomenon. Kuhn and Feyerabend acknowledge the pioneering significance of his work.|$|E
5000|$|A zymogen (...) , {{also called}} a {{proenzyme}} (...) , is an inactive precursor of an enzyme. A zymogen requires a biochemical change (such as a hydrolysis reaction revealing the active site, or changing the configuration {{to reveal the}} active site) for it to become an active enzyme. The biochemical change usually occurs in <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> where a specific part of the precursor enzyme is cleaved in order to activate it. The inactivating piece which is cleaved off can be a peptide unit, or can be independently folding domains comprising more than 100 residues. Although they limit the enzyme's ability, these n-terminal extensions of the enzyme or a “prosegment” often aid in the stabilizing and folding of the enzyme they inhibit.|$|E
5000|$|While an {{assistant}} at Pavia, he demonstrated with a severed peripheral nerve, that the stump attached to the cell body was able to survive and regenerate new branches, while its other stump, being detached from the cell body, degenerated. In 1910 he discovered that a <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> dissociated {{into a number of}} elongated structures during cell division. Perroncito named the split up pieces [...] "dictyosomes".|$|R
50|$|Meiospore {{germination}} {{is usually}} bipolar or tripolar and they develop into densely branched thread-like microthalli. The filaments are 10-15gm in diameter in both species. Growth {{is the result}} of both terminal and intercalary(located between its daughter cells) cell divisions, and in older microthalli longitudinal intercalary divisions are common. The cells contain a star-shaped chloroplast having a typical pyrenoid. The way microthalli will develops depend on the conditions in which they are cultured. Prior to gametogenesis the vegetative cells of the gametophyte contained a number of large vesicles. Several changes occur following the onset of gametogenesis. In the cytoplasm, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) became noticeable and the number of membrane-bound electron-dense (possibly lipid) bodies increased. At a later stage these bodies accumulated in the vesicles. There is a single <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> in the cell which appears to be closely linked with the vesicles. The transition to the next stage is marked by the shrinking of the cytoplasm away from the cell wall. Following this, flagella appear within cytoplasmic vesicles and the paired centrioles of the vegetative cells take on the function of basal bodies (organelles that form the base of a flagellum or cilium). The flagella gains mastigonemes and takes up an external position. At the same time the volume of extracellular material increases. The <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> at this stage occupies a position next to the developing flagella and the vesicles with the <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> contain a noticeable core of electron-dense material. An eyespot develops in the chloroplast which had retained its star-shape throughout gametogenesis. The internal walls of the gametangium then dissolve and the contents are expelled into the sea-water.|$|R
30|$|The co-incubation of QGY (or RBL) {{cells with}} QDs and the {{fluorescent}} marker (LysoTracker, <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> marker, or MitoTracker) {{was carried out}} as follows: cells obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Science Academy were seeded onto a glass cover slip placed in a culture dish containing DMEM-H medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 μg mL− 1 streptomycin and 100 μg mL− 1 neomycin. The cells were then cultured in a fully humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 for their attachment to the cover slip. When the cells reached 80 % confluence, the QD aqueous solution with a QD concentration of 50 – 100 μg mL− 1 plus the LysoTracker (100 nM), <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> marker (5 μM) or MitoTracker (100 nM) in the growth medium were added into the culture dish [9]. The cells were incubated for 30 – 60 min in an incubator before the subcellular localization pattern of the QDs was studied. The cells were kept at 37 °C during the microscopic examination using a temperature controller (Olympus).|$|R
5000|$|Upon injury of a {{peripheral}} axon, the entire neuron immediately reacts {{in order to}} regenerate the axon. This reaction requires an increased metabolic activity and is initiated by chromatolysis. Chromatolysis is characterized as the dissolution of protein-producing structures in the cell body of a neuron [...] and is a term used to characterize apoptosis of neuronal cells. During chromatolysis, the soma and nucleus round and enlarge, the Nissl bodies and <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies</b> both disintegrate, and the cytocentrum is cleared. In most cases, the axotomy response in peripheral axons ends in cell healing and regeneration, though it may occasionally end in cell death. Regeneration occurs because of microglial hyperplasia and astroglial hypertrophy, activities that are lacking in the central axotomy response.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} weight of AT {{was found to}} be 218 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. AT is a glycoprotein. It has 86% carbohydrate content. It has been reported that the maturation of AT is a stepwise process beginning with a carbohydrate-free 41 kDa protein; this form is then core-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum to form a 76 kDa glycol-protein. In <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> the protein is further glycosylated yielding a 180 kDa form, which ultimately attains a maturity in vacuoles, where its {{molecular weight}} becomes around 220 kDa. The 41 kDa carbohydrate free protein moiety of the enzyme was obtained by Endoglycosidase H treatment of purified AT, resulted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis27. AT exhibited an apparent Km for trehalose of about 4.7 mM at pH 4.5. The gene responsible for AT activity in S. cerevisiae is ATH1.|$|E
50|$|Kinesins are a {{group of}} related motor {{proteins}} that use a microtubule track in anterograde movement. They are vital to spindle formation in mitotic and meiotic and chromosomes separation during cell division and are also responsible for shuttling mitochondria, <b>Golgi</b> <b>bodies,</b> and vesicles within eukaryotic cells. Kinesin have two heavy chains and two light chains per active motor. The two globular head motor domains in heavy chains can convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work to move along microtubules. The direction in which cargo is transported can be towards the plus-end or the minus-end, {{depending on the type}} of kinesin. In general, kinesins with N-terminal motor domains move their cargo towards the plus ends of microtubules located at the cell periphery, while kinesins with C-terminal motor domains move cargo towards the minus ends of microtubules located at the nucleus. Fourteen distinct kinesin families are known, with some additional kinesin-like proteins that cannot be classified into these families.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{coagulation}} factor deficiency protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MCFD2 gene. Mutations in MCFD2 cause the combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII (F5F8D), a recessive bleeding disorder. MCFD2 and ERGIC-53 (or LMAN1) form a protein complex {{and serve as}} a cargo receptor to transport FV and FVIII from the ER to the <b>Golgi</b> <b>body.</b> Mutations in LMAN1 gene (encoding ERGIC-53 or LMAN1) also cause F5F8D.|$|R

There is a single chloroplast with a girdle lamella and a single, dense mitochondrion with tubular cristae. A single <b>Golgi</b> <b>body</b> with swelled cisternae lies beneath the flagellum, and each cell has an ejectile organelle that putatively releases a cylindrical structure. A vacuole, or cluster of vacuoles, contains the putative carbohydrate storage product.|$|R
