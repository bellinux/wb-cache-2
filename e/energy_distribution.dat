5|$|The {{temperature}} {{of a star}} determines its spectral type via {{its effect on the}} physical properties of plasma in its photosphere. A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> is given by the color index, B−V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star's temperature.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of low energy atomic collision and ionization processes at surfaces are {{under investigation for}} satellite applications. Atomic scattering experiments have been performed under high vacuum conditions (- 10 - 8 Torr) similar to those encountered in space environments. Experimental results indicate that energy loss in fact depends on the charge state of the incident atom. Measurements have been accomplished for all charge states of atomic hydrogen (H+,H-,H) impacting a copper surface and scattering as If. <b>Energy</b> and angular <b>distributions</b> of scattered If are presented here for collision energies ranging from 25 - 200 eV.

25|$|A massive {{ideal gas}} {{with only one}} type of {{particle}} is uniquely described by three state functions such as the temperature, volume, {{and the number of}} particles. However, for a black body, the <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> is established by the interaction of the photons with matter, usually the walls of the container. In this interaction, the number of photons is not conserved. As a result, the chemical potential of the black body photon gas is zero. The number of state variables needed to describe a black body state is thus reduced from three to two (e.g. temperature and volume).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> {{manifest}} in the kinetic isotope effect and the equilibrium isotope effect. In a reversible reaction, under equilibrium conditions, the reaction will proceed forwards and backwards, distributing the isotopes to minimize thermodynamic free energy. Some time later, at equilibrium, more heavy isotopes {{will be on the}} product side. The stability of the lower energy drives the products to be enriched in deuterium relative to reactants. Conversely, under kinetic conditions, reactions are generally irreversible. The limiting step in the reaction is overcoming the activation energy barrier to reach an intermediate state. The lighter isotope has a higher energy state in the quantum well and will thus be preferentially formed into products. Thus under kinetic conditions the product will be relatively depleted in deuterium.|$|E

40|$|In a parallel-plate 13. 56 MHz rf reactor {{energetic}} argon neutrals {{are created}} by charge-exchange collisions in the sheath adjacent to the powered electrode. Energetic argon neutrals are detected by sampling neutrals through a 100 Mym orifice in the cathode. Downstream the orifice neutrals are analyzed parallel to the cathode normal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an energy filter having an angular acceptance of about 2. 5 degree. The pressure range considered was between 5 and 50 m Torr with dc bias potentials between - 100 and - 400 V. The measured neutral <b>energy</b> <b>distributions</b> for low pressures and low dc bias potentials have a maximum intensity at low energies slowly decreasing toward higher energies. For higher pressures and higher dc bias potentials the <b>energy</b> <b>distributions</b> have minimal intensities at low energies, exhibit a maximum at roughly 40 eV, subsequently decreasing toward higher energies. This behavior is explained as being caused by multiple scattering of e nergetic neutrals in the sheath. Experimental neutral <b>energy</b> <b>distributions</b> are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. In the calculations charge exchange collisions, elastic scattering, and multiple collisions are taken into account.

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their <b>energy</b> <b>distribution,</b> and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Two {{facets of}} the result came under {{particular}} scrutiny within the neutrino community: the GPS synchronization system, and {{the profile of the}} proton beam spill that generated neutrinos. The second concern was addressed in the November rerun: for this analysis, OPERA scientists repeated the measurement over the same baseline using a new CERN proton beam which circumvented the need to make any assumptions about the details of neutrino production during the beam activation, such as <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> or production rate. This beam provided proton pulses of 3nanoseconds each with up to 524 nanosecond gaps. This meant a detected neutrino could be tracked uniquely to its generating 3 nanoseconds pulse, and hence its start and end travel times could be directly noted. Thus, the neutrino's speed could now be calculated without having to resort to statistical inference.|$|E
25|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} driver mounting arrangements {{to create a}} specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled <b>energy</b> <b>distribution</b> from the input signal (some using this approach are called monitors, as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later Bose models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in high fidelity circles, but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.|$|E
