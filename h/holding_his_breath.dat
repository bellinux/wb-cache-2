25|$|When using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac {{sometimes}} {{brought a}} kerosene lamp (visible {{in some of}} his work) if there was insufficient light, keeping his back to a wall for support, and <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Houdini {{introduced}} the Chinese Water Torture Cell, {{in which he}} was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for more than three minutes. He would go on performing this escape {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Bishop Desmond Tutu, who Bilheimer had {{previously}} interviewed for The Cry of Reason, appears {{towards the end}} of the film, saying, [...] "Each of us has the capacity to be a saint." [...] Bilheimer included Tutu in Not My Life because he felt that audiences might be in need of pastoral counseling after watching the film. The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: [...] "I can't see a good life while there are people living like animals. Not because I'm a good person, not because it's my duty, but because they are humanâ€”like me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two teams occupy {{opposite}} {{halves of}} a small field and take turns sending a raider into the other half to win points by tagging and wrestling members of the opposing team.

2500|$|It {{is a sign}} of a {{pathologic}} state, {{usually a}} failing or hypertrophic left ventricle, as in systemic hypertension, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sound occurs just after atrial contraction at the end of diastole and immediately before S1, producing a rhythm sometimes referred to as the [...] "Tennessee" [...] gallop where S4 represents the [...] "Ten-" [...] syllable. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop, also known as the [...] "Hello-Goodbye" [...] gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop, sometimes referred to as S7.|$|E
2500|$|Deadly Premonition {{contains}} several combat sequences, {{in which}} York encounters supernatural enemies while {{trapped in the}} Other World. York may battle them using melee weapons or firearms, or may choose to evade them by <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Melee weapons will eventually break with continued use, and York's pulse increases whenever he runs or holds his breath. Periodically, York encounters the Raincoat Killer, which will activate either a quick time event, a chase sequence, or a hiding event necessary to escape the murderer. During the Other World sequences, York's primary objective is to investigate crimes that took place there in the recent past. He collects photos of evidence to use to [...] "profile" [...] the scene and reconstruct events that took place with his deductive skills. Furthermore, the Other World regularly affects the entire town, excepting the interior of buildings, from midnight to six in the morning.|$|E

2500|$|... "committed an unforgivable foul in {{the penalty}} box; the harsh blast of the referee's whistle, his finger {{pointing}} {{to one of}} the most calamitous places in the purgatory of this life; the penalty spot. The heavy odour of death hung over the fateful spot: did you not hear a crowd of thousands suddenly become dumb mutes, did you not see the players standing in a half circle as if they were at a graveside... Everyone <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> I have always believed that Roose grew to his full height as a man in the purgatorial crisis of a penalty, drying off the clay around his feet, washing away the dross which entered his character with the gold... Arthur's sword against the bare fist. Then came the signal; the ball travelled like a bolt from the foot of the penalty taking forward, and in the blink of an eyelid, revolution, a thump, and the ball landed in the heather and gorse of the Buarth." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Butt-Head's main {{interest}} {{in life is}} [...] "chicks", Beavis {{seems to be more}} interested in toilet humor and displays of violence. Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying [...] "Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing.|$|E
