5|$|A member may be disqualified <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{found to}} be of unsound mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{convicted and sentenced to}} imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, or if he has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied to a foreign country. Any questions as to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{has been}} playing {{football}} his entire life, he tried out ice hockey in his youth and was part of AIK <b>IF.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a lifelong supporter of Manchester United and dreams of playing for the club one day.|$|E

5|$|In an end tag, Blake confronts Coulson {{about his}} insubordination, warning {{him that he}} could lose his team <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not careful.|$|E
5|$|Roger {{was sent}} into exile after his family's disgrace. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the same person}} as the archdeacon of Berkshire, {{he died in the}} middle of the 1160s, but no other sure {{information}} is known about him after his exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> standing still.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke with}} a passive sort of acquiescence,--as {{if it did not}} much matter, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> not able, and no one would {{particularly}} rejoice, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Notitia Africae also names one Deuterius from Simminensis [...] However, it <b>is</b> {{uncertain}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Bishop of Simminensis or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{from the}} town and bishop elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the back of the seat, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|R
5|$|Gurnemanz {{knows that}} the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite. The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk he seems to {{scarcely}} move, yet feels as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> traveling far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{incapable of}} interpreting the laws correctly, {{he should not}} stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In the {{seemingly}} empty city, Rick follows a helicopter flying overhead {{right into a}} horde of zombies. They attack his horse, forcing him to drop his bag of weapons and take shelter in a tank. As the zombies swarm the vehicle, {{a voice from the}} tank's radio sarcastically asks Rick <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> comfortable in there.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{said all}} this, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> reading it aloud; or, still more, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any {{approach}} to spontaneity were {{his face and}} manner.|$|R

5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me, and his eyelids hung heavy {{over his eyes}} as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> drinking, or as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> tired.|$|R
5000|$|... "O God, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a doer of good, then {{increase}} his good deeds, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wrongdoer, then overlook his bad deeds. O God, forgive him {{and give him}} the steadiness to say the right thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is a bachelor, {{and there}} is a natural {{affinity}} between bachelors and widows--much more than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a widower too. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a widower I should say it <b>was</b> undoubtedly mademoiselle. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a little bit younger, I should have no doubt it was madame; but men of that age have such an ambition to marry young girls! I suppose that they think it proves they are not so very old, after all. And certainly he isn't too old to marry. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> wise--which <b>he</b> probably isn't, <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> like other men in such matters--there wouldn't be any question about Mrs. Bowen. Pretty creature! And so much sense! Too much for him. Ah, my dear, how we are wasted upon that sex!" ...|$|R
5|$|A Kentucky {{governor}} is elected under our constitution {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing of}} Scully collapsing, Mulder {{arrives at the}} {{hospital}} where Scully is being treated. Before {{he is able to}} make contact with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents. Mulder is then brought to Blevins and a senior agent who demands information on why Scully lied about Mulder's death. After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> given a good reason to do so.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
50|$|Ryder {{was well}} liked by all {{who knew him}} because of his easy going attitude, but he could command a room with his {{speaking}} style. “Ken was a tremendous speaker. His voice was resonant, his tone perfectly pitched. He managed to sound as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> talking one on one even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> behind a podium and there were 800 people on the other side, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> at a desk and there were 40 faculty senators facing him, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> at a table confronting six agenda committee members. Ken always sounded extemporaneous. He never gave canned speeches. He didn't read from a text, he looked up, made eye contact and spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is a great}} disappointment,' said Lady Corisande; 'but he will yet arrive, though late. I {{should be}} most unhappy though, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> absent from his post on such an {{occasion}} I <b>am</b> sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> here I could not dance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a mean-spirited, selfish man. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> not, <b>he</b> {{could not}} have talked as he did last night. Because you do not love him, Mildred, you cannot love such a man as that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> fifty times {{a member of the}} Government." ...|$|R
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
5|$|Each Cosmos player {{named to}} a NASL all-star team is named below, {{along with his}} regular season and {{play-off}} statistics. The nationality given for each player {{is based on the}} national team represented, or his birthplace <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> uncapped. No NASL all-star from the Cosmos was born in the United States or Canada. During the club's 14 NASL seasons, the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award was won by a Cosmos player on five occasions, which are also detailed below.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the show, {{the woman}} had to choose one man. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> straight, the man and woman would split the prize money, but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay, then <b>he</b> would receive all the money and the woman would receive nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa, I {{have often}} thought {{that in our}} rank of life society is {{responsible}} for the kind of things which young men do. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at Goodwood, which I do not believe, so <b>was</b> Mr. Stackpoole. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> betting, so was Mr. Stackpoole." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although his surname is {{pronounced}} ( [...] ), Grytpype-Thynne would pronounce it [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{in a bad}} way or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> thought Milligan <b>was</b> overacting his part.|$|R
