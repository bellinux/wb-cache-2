In the present investigations, analysis of flow through the stepped <b>horizontal</b> <b>orifice</b> is done based on experimental investigations. The flow through the different horizontal orifices working under relative heads is analysed and the discharge coefficient for the stepped <b>horizontal</b> <b>orifice</b> is determined. The relevance of the present research carried out is highlighted with respect to inclined weir, researched by the authors. The discharge coefficient for the stepped orifice is found to vary within an acceptable percentage deviation from the mean value. The experimental head-discharge plot also indicates {{the validity of the}} research work with most of the experimental values falling on the established equation for the flow through non-coplanar rectangular horizontal slots. The non-coplanar horizontal slots are found to increase the coefficient of discharge. __________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|E
40|$|Bubble {{formation}} {{under constant}} pressure conditions {{has been investigated}} for wide range of variation of liquid properties. Air bubbles were formed from single <b>horizontal</b> <b>orifices</b> submerged in liquids whose viscosity varied from 1 · 0 to 600 cPs and surface tension from 37 to 72 dyn/cm. Air flow rate was varied from 2 to 250 cm 3 /sec and the orifice diameter from 0 · 0515 to 0 · 4050 cm...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of migrating adult salmonids to various placements of rectangular fishway orifices was {{studied at the}} Fisheries-Engineering Research Laboratory, on the Washington end of Bonneville Dam. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri), and coho salmon (O. kisutch) approaching a vertical wall had the the alternatives of entering rectangular orifices positioned either horizontally or vertically and either shallow (3 feet) or deep (9 feet). The responses of the three species to the various orifice conditions are analyzed. More migrants passed through shallow orifices than deep orifices, and more salmonids entered vertical <b>orifices</b> than <b>horizontal</b> <b>orifices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bubble {{formation}} from single <b>horizontal</b> <b>orifices</b> {{submerged in}} Newtonian liquids {{has been investigated}} for such chamber volumes that both the pressure inside the chamber and flow rate into the bubble are time dependent. The data collected show that under these conditions the bubble volume decreases exponentially with increase in orifice submergence. The equations for the generalized two stage model of bubble formation, taking the variation of gas flow rate with time into account, have been derived. These equations reduce to the cases of constant gas flow rate and constant pressure when adequate constraints are imposed. The results obtained under intermediate conditions have been quantitatively explained {{on the basis of}} these equations...|$|R

The image {{here on the}} right {{represents}} a two dimensional wall jet between two parallel plane walls, where the [...] "obstacle" [...] is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat <b>horizontal</b> rectangular <b>orifice,</b> so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only {{on the opposite side}} in turbulent mixing with ambient air.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{relates to}} a multi-orifice {{distributor}} for a gas-fluidised bed, using many upward-facing nozzles, equally spaced in a <b>horizontal</b> plate. Each <b>orifice</b> contained a removable helical coil, {{which made the}} gas swirl as it entered the bed. For a single orifice in such a distributor, ultra-fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pressure measurements were applied to study: (i) the formation of jets and bubbles and (ii) the orifice pressure drop. Results from MRI show that the swirling flow induced by the helix significantly improves the fluidisation quality compared to a plain nozzle without spiral. The helix gives rise to secondary flow which increases pressure drop across the nozzle, the measured values of which are predicted satisfactorily by using a friction factor correlation for helical coils.
