As a young man, I have to tell you, he struck us as {{a cross between a}} mad geometer and Peter Sellers. And it was a remarkable education to teach Jagdish Bhagwati. Seen from my perspective, as an outsider in international economics and trade theory and commercial policy, I think of Jagdish, professionally, as having been an important methodological influence on his branch of economics and economic theory – and a very good methodological influence. For a subject so complex and so general equilibrium in character, trade theory has been relatively free of technical fireworks for their own sake, and more particularly, trade theory – international trade economics – has not been vulnerable to a bad kid of malformation that is common in Economics. And what I have in mind is a sort of uncritical adoption of foolish special assumptions {{for no other reason than}} that they lead, by a difficult technical path, to strong conclusions that are then defended on the ground that anything that is arrived at in such a difficult way just has to be true. The feeling of that kind of excess has been absent from trade theory, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that is due to the kind of economist Jagdish has been – and is.

[...] Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, State School Board Chairman Otis Brumby, and Board of Regents Chancellor Stephen Portch will {{summarize}} the state education reform effort during the University of Georgia School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s observance of Law Day on Friday, March 31 from 9 : 30 - 10 : 30 a. m. in the UGA Chapel. Their panel discussion will focus upon the final provisions of 2 ̆ 2 The Future of Education in Georgia: A+ Education Reform Act of 2000, 2 ̆ 2 the landmark bill {{which has just}} passed the Georgia General Assembly. Both Barnes and Brumby are alumni of the UGA law school, Barnes earning his law degree in 1972 and Brumby in 1965. Following their discussion, the three panelists will entertain 15 minutes of questions from the audience. 2 ̆ 2 The future of public education in our state is obviously of prime importance to every Georgia citizen, but of especially keen interest to parents, educators and students themselves, 2 ̆ 2 said David Shipley, dean of the UGA law school. 2 ̆ 2 We are pleased {{to be able to}} deliver information straight from the top to the local community through this unique Law Day forum. It 2 ̆ 7 s also beneficial to our law students to understand the role of lawyers as public servants and catalysts for social change. 2 ̆ 2 The afternoon program for Law Day will feature the trial re-enactment of portions of a major international military scandal: 2 ̆ 2 The Aviano Trial: Military Pilots Out-of-Control or a Tragic Accident? 2 ̆ 2 presented in the UGA Chapel from 2 : 30 - 4 : 30 p. m. Attorneys attending may earn 1. 5 hours of continuing legal education credit in trial practice. The incident occurred in February 1998, when Marine pilot Richard Ashby severed a ski gondola cable while flying at a low altitude during a training mission through the Italian Alps. The gondola crashed to the slopes below, killing 20 multinational tourists who were on board. Captain Ashby was court-martialed on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and various other counts involving the destruction of military and civilian property. He was acquitted of all charges by a military jury, following a 5 -week trial that cost the U. S. government more than 2 million. The verdict, covered by more news outlets worldwide than the O. J. Simpson acquittal, strained U. S. -Italian diplomatic relations and [...] many commentators believe [...] led to the early release from U. S. prisons of convicted Italian terrorists. The lead military defense counsel for Ashby was Major Bill Weber, a UGA law school alumnus who joined the law school as director of advocacy last fall. Weber will lead his moot court and mock trial students in a re-enactment of portions of the trial, utilizing trial transcripts for crucial direct- and cross-examination, displaying trial exhibits, and replaying actual flight simulations demonstrated to the jury. 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people who heard the verdict went away thinking that the trial was just a sham and that in the end, a bunch of Marine Corps officers simply protected one of their own, 2 ̆ 2 said Weber. 2 ̆ 2 That 2 ̆ 7 s not true, but that is how the case was portrayed by the media. It 2 ̆ 7 s important for people to understand that the military doesn 2 ̆ 7 t whitewash things like this. The government just didn 2 ̆ 7 t have a case. No trial observer present for the whole proceeding was shocked by the verdict, and now a local audience will be able to examine the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s case and the defense 2 ̆ 7 s case and make up their own minds as to whether the acquittal was just. 2 ̆ 2 The morning program on education reform and the afternoon trial re-enactment are the focal points of an entire day of activities billed as 2 ̆ 2 Family Day 2 ̆ 2 at the law school: family members of first-year law students observe classes, tour the facilities, and attend a student awards luncheon. Law Day/Family Day concludes with a benefit auction at Tasty World, located in downtown Athens at the corner of Broad and Jackson Streets, at 7 : 30 p. m. Proceeds from the event, sponsored by the Student Bar Association and Equal Justice Foundation, help provide summer stipends for law students who accept fellowships in non-funded public interest law positions. Auction items include a BAR/BRI course; unique activities and items donated by faculty, staff and alumni; local business packages; and UGA sports memorabilia.

40|$|Survival in {{a falling}} market Cue: There?s {{an awful lot}} of coffee in Vietnam. In fact in the last five years, Vietnamese coffee harvests have grown from {{virtually}} zero to become the second largest in the world, behind Brazil. Unfortunately the world?s coffee farmers are now growing more than the world?s people are drinking, and with global over-production has come a global decline in prices. For coffee growers in countries like Tanzania, times are hard. How can smallholder coffee farmers survive in such a falling market? Technoserve is an NGO that is helping Tanzanian farmers to do exactly that, concentrating not on how to grow more coffee, but on finding the best prices at the coffee auctions. Lazarus Laiser spoke to Mr. Thomson Dixon, Country Director of Technoserve Tanzania, about the challenge for African coffee growers to compete on the world market. He began by asking Mr. Dixon what he thought coffee farmers needed to do to survive in the face of falling prices. IN:		?What we see happening ? OUT:		?individual farmers can prosper. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 19 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: A report from Tanzania described the challenges facing coffee growers. Many of the points will be relevant for other export crops. Transcript Dixon	What we see happening in the coffee market is, you basically need to become a speciality coffee farmer to obtain good prices in today?s market. If your coffee quality is truly very very good, you can find very good prices in the market. Kenyan coffees are sometimes trading at over $ 2 per pound, because of their superb quality. I think Tanzania faces the same opportunities. We have had buyers in from Italy, we have had buyers in from the United States, expressing a very strong interest in Tanzanian coffee. However, uniformly they are saying that the quality is not there yet. And my feeling is that if a farmer, or a group of farmers fail to bring their quality up, they will face continued intense competition from low cost Vietnamese producers. So {{the answer to the question}} really is to get to the top of the market, be the best quality you possibly can, and there you have the best chance of survival. Laiser	And now I would like to ask you as an expert, what are the government actions in terms of both protecting against dangers, and supporting farmers efforts to take advantage of the market? Dixon	The government can provide a context, make sure that the laws are clear, make sure that the conditions under which business takes place are secure. We are facing some difficulties this year because the regulations for the coffee harvest this season have not been published yet, and therefore <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of farmers, and a lot of buyers are maybe somewhat confused about what is permitted and what is not permitted. So I think that number one the government must act with great clarity on these issues. And I think that in terms of farmers, it?s very important for the farmers to be educated on how the market works, and what the customers are looking for, so that farmers can produce to the needs of the customer. Because, when you have an Italian buyer in, saying ?I would like to see it prepared in this fashion or that fashion?, you have to be aware of that, and balance the pros and cons of doing that. And I think that is where the private sector, together perhaps with government officials, can come together and create the strategies for attending to the market. Laiser	What can non-government organisations do in order to support small-scale farmers? Dixon	They can do a variety of things. In the case of Technoserve, we are assisting groups of small farmers to take their coffee to auction, look for the best price possible at auction. We believe very strongly in adding value by doing pulping of the coffee, bulking that coffee into 5, 10, 15 or 20 ton units, and selling that as a single unit at the auction. This is really what the government was trying to do many years ago, and Tanzanian coffee was superb many years ago, and developed a tremendous name for its quality. But then those pulperies fell into disuse, and it became an individual activity instead. It is definitely time for farmers to be putting in pulperies again, and this will be what it takes to pull the coffee quality up, and that way the nation and the individual farmers can prosper. End of track. The Country Director of Technoserve Tanzania, a non-government organisation, explains how the Tanzanian coffee market has been affected by a global glut in coffee production, and how both the government and the Tanzanian farmers need to improve their management of coffee production, so that it can compete with low-cost foreign coffee...|$|E

Summary Introduction and aim of the study: Volleyball is a team sport in which the results consist of a large number of factors. The risk of injury for daily training is very high. Volleyball is also an asymmetric sport, which further increases the risk of injury. Simple screening test, which is Functional Movement Screen, will reduce this risk, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of clubs will decide to implement of it. The main aim of this study is to present and compare the results of the functional assessment of motor and susceptibility to injury in female volleyball players and their interplay with injuries which happened in the last three years. Aim of the study was carried out based on the study material comprising a group of 15 women, practicing volleyball professionally. The research group age was between of 20 - 35 years. Material and Method: Functional Movement Screen- functional screening was the research method. It is using the seven tests which can assess the patient's/athlete’s basic movement patterns. All motion tasks are assessed on a scale 0 to 3. The players also filled the questionnaire. Results: Maximum disturbance revealed deep squat test. The smallest disorders showed shoulder mobility test for the left hand and in line lunge test for the left leg. Three of the five single limb tests showed asymmetry: hurdle step, deep squat, shoulder mobility. 53 % of players have experienced a serious injury in the last three seasons. The two players with the highest number of FMS points have not been seriously injured so far. Discussion and Conclusion: The consistency between the FMS test results and the frequency of injuries in II league female volleyball players was different, then in other studies. For the participants deep squat was the most difficult test, over 50 % of players had painful knees, average points in FMS test was 14, 73...|$|E
