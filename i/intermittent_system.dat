The systems were monitored for methane production, effluent concentration, volatile fatty acids, and microbial populations of the Eubacteria, Archaea and Syntrophomonadaceae groups. This last microbial group {{has been reported in}} literature as being determinant for the degradation of fatty substrates present in the wastewater and subsequent biogas production.

40|$|Abstract: Solar {{adsorption}} refrigeration {{is promising}} technology {{especially in the}} developing countries and remote areas because the system can be driven by solar energy without involving electricity. Therefore, it is technologically possible and socially feasible in the areas where electricity is not enough but solar energy is rather easy to obtain. The conventional system works intermittently and produces cooling only during night. In this article, a solar adsorption refrigerator is pre-sented that produces cooling continuously using only solar energy. The system consists of two beds with CPC collectors, a condenser and evaporator. The one cycle complete in two days. A simulation model was developed to evaluate the sys-tem performance. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the system, and to compare the system behaviour with the conventional system. The results show that system produces continuous cooling. Cooling rate decreased {{in the middle of the}} day because of relatively high ambient temperature. The performance of the system in-creased with high value of heat transfer coefficient between receiver and bed, and decreased by increasing the adsorbent mass. The performance of the continuous system was compared with that of <b>intermittent</b> <b>system.</b> It was found that the evaporator temperature in the <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> increased during the day because cooling is not produced during day in that system, while proposed system kept the evaporator at low temperature continuously.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{problems}} in applying cycle expansions to bound chaotic systems, caused by e. g. intermittency and incompleteness of the symbolic dynamics. We discuss zeta functions associated with weighted evolution operators and in particular a one-parameter family of weights relevant for the calculation of classical resonance spectra, semiclassical spectra and topological entropy. For bound <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> we discuss an approximation of the zeta function in terms of probabilities rather than cycle instabilities. This approximation provides a generalization of the fundamental part of a cycle expansion for a finite subshift symbolic dynamics. This approach is particularly suitable for determining asymptotic properties of periodic orbits which are essential for scrutinizing the semiclassical limit of Gutzwiller's semiclassical trace formula. The Sinai billiard is used as model system. In particular we develope a crude approximation of the semiclassical zeta function {{which turns out to}} possess non analytical features. We also discuss the contribution to the semiclassical level density from the neutral orbits. Finally we discuss implications of our findings for the spectral form factor and compute the asymptotic behaviour of the spectral rigidity. The result is found to be consistent with exact quantum mechanical calculations. Comment: 18 pages LaTeX, figures 2 - 8 on separate. uu file, fig 1 available from author on reques...|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{strategies}} for operating buses on signal-controlled arterials using special lanes {{that are made}} intermittently available to general traffic. The advantage of special bus lanes, intermittent or dedicated, is that they free buses from traffic interference; the disadvantage is that they disrupt traffic. We find that bus lanes with intermittent priority (BLIPs), unlike dedicated ones, do not significantly reduce street capacity. Intermittence, however, increases the average traffic density at which the demand is served, {{and as a result}} increases traffic delay. These delays are more than offset by the benefits to bus passengers as long as traffic demand does not exceed by much the maximum flow possible on the non-special lanes; the smaller the excess the better. BLIPs are not intended for roadways nearing or in excess of capacity. The main factors determining whether an <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> saves time are: the traffic saturation level; the bus frequency; the improvement in bus travel time achieved by the special lane; and the ratio of bus and car occupant flows. In some scenarios where a dedicated bus lane could not be operated, a BLIP can save to bus and car occupants together as much as 20 persons-min of travel per bus-km. The required conditions for this to happen are quite particular. Typical savings are smaller. Formulae are given. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the spectrum of}} the evolution operator for bound chaotic systems by evaluating its trace. This trace is known to approach unity as t →∞ for bound systems. It is written as the Fourier transform of the logaritmic derivative of a zeta function whose zeros are identified with the eigenvalues of the operator. Zeta functions {{are expected to be}} entire only for very specific systems, like Axiom-A systems. For bound chaotic systems complications arise due to e. g. intermittency and non completeness of the symbolic dynamics. For bound <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> an approximation of the zeta function is derived. It is argued that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta function and traces approaching unity as a powerlaw. Another feature of bound chaotic systems, relevant for the asymptotics of the trace, is that the dominant time scale can be much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit. This the case for e. g. the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical implications are discussed at the end. Comment: 20 pages LATEX. Figures available upon request from autho...|$|E
30|$|An {{alternative}} dynamic regime {{proposed to}} underly switching between seizure and non-seizure states in absence seizures is noise-driven bistability [4, 27 – 30]. Similarly to our current work, this dynamic regime {{has been investigated}} both in mechanistic neural mass models [4] and in reduced forms preserving bistability between a stable steady state and a stable limit cycle [29, 30]. In the current study, we employ similar equations, though the resulting bifurcation structure is different as we focus upon transitions between qualitatively different oscillations (following [7]), rather than between a fixed point and a limit cycle. Furthermore, [30] and [29] explored the effect of qualitative changes in network structure on the resulting dynamics. In addition to this work in bistable systems, future such explorations in our low dimensional framework for intermittency can {{provide insight into the}} role of network connectivity on seizure occurrence. In addition, recent work has explored the possibility that critical transitions are responsible for seizure termination in focal onset seizures with secondary generalisation. [11] showed that certain features of these transitions, such as slowing and flickering [31] can be seen in recordings from patients with these seizure types, and slowing of absence seizure rhythms toward seizure termination does occur. In our <b>intermittent</b> <b>system,</b> the dynamics of seizure termination are governed {{by the nature of the}} vector field where the system leaves the previously stable limit cycle. Whether such hallmarks can be seen in intermittent models is yet to be determined. Although in the current study we focused on robustness of the mechanisms of intermittent transitions, in future studies, it will be interesting to explore other details of the waveforms of seizure EEG.|$|E

Few data are {{available}} {{of the impact of}} intermittent water supply (IWS) on the water quality and quantity delivered to households. This thesis examines the impact of intermittently supplied piped water on {{the quality and quantity of}} water delivered to residential taps in Hubli-Dharwad, India, when compared to continuous piped water supply. A framework for understanding the pathways through which IWS can impact water quality is first developed. The extent to which contamination occurs in Hubli-Dharwad is quantified by comparing microbial water quality throughout the distribution system in an <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> and a continuous system in the same city. The mechanisms affecting water quality in the IWS network in Hubli-Dharwad are identified by measuring changes in water quality over time using continuous measurements from pressure and physico-chemical sensors paired with grab samples tested for indicator bacteria. In the final chapter, a new method of measuring household water consumption in an IWS when supply durations are limited and few metered {{data are available}} is developed. This thesis showed that the intermittent supply was frequently subject to contamination in the distribution system and that households with intermittent supply consumed limited quantities of water. While these results demonstrated that converting to a continuous water supply can improve water quality when compared to intermittent supply, this conversion may not be possible in the near future for resource-constrained towns and cities. This thesis contributes to knowledge of the mechanisms causing contamination and constricting water access in IWS systems, which can help improve systems to ensure that people with piped water receive water that is reliable, safe, and sufficient...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the idea}} of Fernard Braudel, that Mediterranean is «a {{thousand}} things together. It is not one landscape, but numerous landscapes; it is not one sea, but a complex of seas. It is not one civilization, but a number of civilizations, piled one above the other…», we can say that the word “Mediterranean” does not only express an affinity condition with geography, but more specifically recognizes the historical values in the multiplicity of Mediterranean landscapes, which mainly concern the architectures, the different living cultures and the ways of living. Therefore the Mediterranean is seen as a symbolic territory, rich of histories of populations, religions, wet lands, landscapes and a complex geography, with its high peaks, deserts, rivers, level grounds. Here the memories of the places are blended with different readings of the myth, the stories; and then we have the traditions, where there is still the presence of elements and parts that remain over time. For this reason, the coastal territory which lays from Ercolano to Sorrento, including between the Gulf of Naples and the Vesuvius and the Lattari Mountains, can be interpreted as a place of several Mediterranean landscapes, each one consisting of specific and different materials. Among them, the archaeological landscapes, overlooked by archaeological ruins of ancient Pompeii, Herculaneum and Oplontis, and punctuated by an <b>intermittent</b> <b>system,</b> often discontinuous, of less well-known episodes, that also define the character of this extraordinary territory.

40|$|The United Nation's Millennium Development Goal Target 7. C is to "halve, by 2015, the {{proportion}} of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water". While the UN claimed to have met this goal, {{studies have shown that the}} "improved" sources used as a metric to track progress do not always supply safe water. One example of these improved sources is the piped water in Tamale, Ghana, which is an <b>intermittent</b> <b>system.</b> The question raised and goal of this research is to determine whether this water source is indeed safe. The Ghana Water Company Ltd. in Tamale had handwritten notebooks containing almost ten years of water quality sample data. This data was entered into a computer database so it could be analyzed for seasonal and geographic trends as well as to gain an understanding of overall water quality. From this analysis, it was concluded that seasonal trends do impact the pH and turbidity of source water which influences the water provided to consumers. In addition, 42 % of samples did not comply with accepted World Health Organization guidelines for residual free chlorine concentrations. Total coliform was present in 2 % of samples. Observations of environmental factors made during field work in Tamale found five "no" answers to a sanitary survey indicating at least a medium contamination risk. Overall, these observations indicate that water from the piped network in Tamale is not always safe. Contamination also happens very readily during storage due to high usage of unsafe storage containers in Tamale combined with the low chlorine residuals. by Allison Jean Hansen. Thesis: M.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{pathways}} through which material is transported to the oceans is riverine input. Estuaries, the interface between rivers and the oceans, are characterized by strong hydrodynamic and physico-chemical gradients, wherein the fluxes of the transported material can be substantially modified. Thus, understanding the geochemical dynamics of estuaries {{is an important part}} of constructing elemental mass balances for the marine environment. Apart from few, large perennial rivers, there are hundreds of small and medium size intermittent or ephemeral riverine systems that enter the Mediterranean Sea. Little is known about the extent to which such systems contribute to coastal pollution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sources and distribution patterns of heavy metals and magnetic components in the <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> of Asopos River and to recognize major physical and geochemical processes that control their fluxes to the coastal marine environment. The overall aim of the study was to assess whether estuaries under extreme fluctuations of hydrological regime, act as a source, or sink, for the adjacent marine environment. Asopos River drains an area of 750 Km 2 underlain mostly by limestone, marls and Quaternary alluvial deposits. The permeable substrate (limestone with a high degree of fracturing and karstification and coarse alluvial deposits) favours infiltration and percolation of the greatest part of precipitation volumes, which results to minimum surface runoff. It has been estimated that surface runoff accounts for only 6 % of precipitation, while the mean annual river discharge is approximately 20 · 103 m 3. Water and sediment quality is a function of lithological features and anthropogenic influences. The weathering of ophiolites, found in Asopos drainage basin, results to enhanced suspended and deposited sediment contents of Ni and Cr. On the other hand, elevated water concentrations and sediment content of Pb, Cd and Cu are related to effluents originating from approximately 220 industrial plants operating in river’s catchment area. The magnetic assemblage consisted mainly of ferrimagnetic and canted antiferromagnetic minerals of lithogenic origin. Alkalinity, conductivity and high dissolved organic carbon concentrations in steam waters were found to exert a significant control on inputs and partitioning of metals between the dissolved and particulate phase, before entering the estuarine zone. Further downstream, during high flow conditions dissolved metal concentration and salinity relationships revealed significant positive and negative deviations from the theoretical dilution line, whereas during low flow conditions effective zero salinity end -member concentrations were higher than those in the river. The results of the study revealed that estuarine processes contribute a significant amount of dissolved metals to offshore waters, and that the additional inputs are augmented during the low-flow period. Due to reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, that takes place at a small depth under the bottom surface and is evident from both total and extractable metal and magnetic parameters core profiles, iii iv sediments act as a potential, long -term source of metals for the overlying water column. Moreover, diagenesis resulted to the fining of magnetic oxides particles that are effective binding phases for most of the trace metals studied. The accumulation of aluminosilicates and canted antiferromagnetic minerals at long distances from the river mouth, are regarded as the major transport pathways of fluvial origin trace metals to the coastal marine environment. Even though the high sediment yield of small riverine systems is well defined in the literature, the results of the study indicate that the estuarine geochemical processes account for an additional enhancement of the water column during the low-flow period. ...|$|E

Numa primeira fase, fez-se o estudo do tratamento anaeróbio de efluentes de uma indústria de mobiliário de madeira (efluente de uma cabine de pintura e envernizamento). Fizeram-se ensaios para testar a influência da carga orgânica e da velocidade ascensional da alimentação. Neste estudo os reatores UASB foram operados de forma descontínua com recirculação total do efluente tratado. Foram testadas cargas de 2, 300; 1, 150 e 0, 671 g CQO. L- 1 e velocidades ascensionais de 0, 036; 0, 072; 0, 108 e 0, 179 m. h- 1. As condições operacionais que favoreceram o tratamento deste efluente foram a carga 0, 671 g CQO. L- 1 e a velocidade ascensional 0, 036 m. h- 1, condições para as quais se obteve uma eficiência de remoção de CQO de 86, 9 %, uma eficiência de metanização da CQO removida de 72, 1 % e uma biodegradabilidade de 62, 6 %. Verificou-se que a carga e a velocidade ascensional mais baixas favoreceram a eficiência de metanização e a biodegradabilidade. Os resultados obtidos ao longo dos vários ensaios realizados sugerem a adaptação da biomassa ao substrato aplicado. Conclui-se que o tratamento anaeróbio é uma opção viável para a gestão dos efluentes de cabine de pintura e envernizamento de indústrias de mobiliário de madeira. Numa segunda fase, foram estudadas diferentes estratégias de operação para o arranque de reatores UASB, inoculados com biomassa floculenta não adaptada ao substrato, utilizados no tratamento de efluentes de indústrias de lacticínios (efluente complexo contendo gorduras). As estratégias testadas foram: operação contínua, operação intermitente e operação intermitente com choques de gorduras. Foram realizados dois ensaios, o primeiro com uma carga orgânica de 5, 0 g CQO. L- 1. d- 1 e o segundo ensaio com 8, 5 g CQO. L- 1. d- 1. Em termos de remoção de CQO, as três estratégias de operação resultaram em valores semelhantes (de 51, 3 a 60, 4 %). Nos dois ensaios verificou-se que a operação intermitente com choques de gorduras resultou nos valores mais elevados de metanização da CQO removida, com valores médios de 56, 0 % e 69, 3 % para o primeiro e segundo ensaios, respetivamente. Em comparação, para a operação intermitente, obtiveram-se eficiências de metanização médias de 53, 4 % e 60, 7 %, para o primeiro e segundo ensaios, respetivamente. Na operação contínua, as eficiências médias de metanização da CQO removida foram de 45, 9 % para o primeiro ensaio e 43, 9 % para o segundo ensaio. Verificou-se também que a operação intermitente com choque de gorduras teve um efeito benéfico em termos de sedimentabilidade da biomassa desenvolvida no reator, tendo-se observado a ausência de flutuação no topo do reator, ao contrário do que foi observado com a operação intermitente e com a operação contínua. Por outro lado, o modo de operação intermitente com choques de gordura apresentou a maior percentagem do grupo microbiano Syntrophomonadaceae, atingindo aproximadamente 20 % da contagem total de microrganismos. Dos resultados obtidos conclui-se que a estratégia mais adequada para a adaptação da biomassa floculenta ao efluente de indústria de lacticínios é a operação intermitente com choque de gorduras. This work {{concerns}} {{the study of}} anaerobic treatment of different industrial wastewaters in laboratory-scale UASB reactors. The {{first phase of the}} work foccused on the anaerobic treatment of a wastewater from a wood furniture industry (wastewater from a dying hood). Tests were made to assess the influence of the organic load and the upflow velocity upon the performance of the process. In this research the UASB reactors were operated in a batch mode with total recirculation of the treated effluent. Loads of 2. 300; 1. 150 and 0. 671 g COD. L- 1 and upflow velocities of 0. 036, 0. 072, 0. 108 and 0. 179 m. h- 1 were tested. The operating conditions that favoured the anaerobic treatment of this wastewater were a load of 0. 671 g COD. L- 1 and an upflow velocity of 0, 036 m. h- 1, conditions that lead to a removal efficiency of 86. 9 %, a methanization efficiency of the removed COD of 72. 1 % and a biodegradability of 62. 6 %. It was also established that the lower loads and the lower uplflow velocities favoured the efficiency of methanization of the removed COD and the biodegradability of the wastewater. Finally the results obtained throughout the series of tests performed suggest that the biomass adapted to the applied substrate. It was concluded that the anaerobic process is a viable option for treating the wastewaters from the dying hoods of furniture industries. In a second phase the work foccused on different startup strategies for UASB reactors, inocculated with flocculent biomass not adapted to the substrate, used for the treatment of dairy wastewaters (complex fat containing wastewaters). The tested strategies were: continuous operation, intermittent operation and intermittent operation with fat shocks. Two tests were performed: the first with an organic loading rate of 5. 0 g COD. L- 1. d- 1 and the second with an organic loading rate of 8. 5 g COD. L- 1. d- 1. In terms of COD removal the three tested strategies resulted in similar values (averages for all reactors from 51. 3 to 60. 4 %). In both the tests it was verified that the intermittent operation with fat shocks resulted in the higher values of methanization of the removed COD with averages values of 56. 0 % and 69. 3 % for the first and second tests, respectively. In comparison for the intermittent operation the average methanization efficiencies of the removed COD were 53, 4 % and 60. 7 % for the first and the second tests, respectively. With the continuous operation the average methanization efficiencies of the removed COD were 45. 9 % for the first test and 43. 9 % for the second test. It was also verified that the intermittent operation with fat shocks had a beneficial effect in terms of biomass sedimentability. It was observed that no floating sludge layer was present {{in the top of the}} intermittent reactor with fat shocks in contrast with what was observed with the continuous and the intermittent reactors. On the other hand, the <b>intermittent</b> <b>system</b> with fat shock revealed that a high percentage of microbial group Syntrophomonadaceae, near to 20 % of the total microbial count. From the results of this work it may be concluded that the most adequate strategy for the adaptation of flocculent biomass to dairy wastewater is the intermittent operation with fat shocks.
