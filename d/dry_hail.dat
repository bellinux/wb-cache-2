60|$|Amidst {{all this}} change, and restlessness, and innovation, there remains but one old man, {{who seems to}} mourn the {{downfall}} of this ancient place. He holds no converse with human kind, but, seated on a wooden bench at {{the angle of the}} wall which fronts the crossing from Whitehall-place, watches in silence the gambols of his sleek and well-fed dogs. He is the presiding genius of Scotland-yard. Years and years have rolled over his head; but, in fine weather or in foul, hot or cold, wet or <b>dry,</b> <b>hail,</b> rain, or snow, he is still in his accustomed spot. Misery and want are depicted in his countenance; his form is bent by age, his head is grey with length of trial, but there he sits from day to day, brooding over the past; and thither he will continue to drag his feeble limbs, until his eyes have closed upon Scotland-yard, and upon the world together.|$|E
40|$|Clear air turbulence, wake vortices, <b>dry</b> <b>hail,</b> and {{volcanic}} ash are hazards to civil aviation {{that have not}} been brought to the forefront of public attention by a catastrophic accident. However, these four hazards are responsible for major and minor injuries, emotional trauma, significant aircraft damage, and in route and terminal area inefficiency. Most injuries occur during clear air turbulence. There is significant aircraft damage for any {{volcanic ash}} encounter. Rolls induced by wake vortices occur near the ground. <b>Dry</b> <b>hail</b> often appears as an area of weak echo on the weather radar. This paper will present the meteorological, electromagnetic, and spatiotemporal characteristics of each hazard. A description of a typical aircraft encounter with each hazard will be given.

30|$|Weather index-based crop {{insurance}} represents a very promising agricultural risk management strategy that farmers may use to mitigate adverse climate hazards and natural catastrophes encountered during farming activities. In {{many parts of}} the world, implementation of such {{crop insurance}} policies have allowed for consistent support to farmers to limit the losses that natural calamities like droughts, flood, variabilities in rainfall and/or temperature, <b>dry</b> spells, <b>hail,</b> and heat waves might cause to crop yields and income. It has several advantages in that it minimizes both moral hazard and adverse selection and it makes faster payouts during natural disasters, which means that farmers will not have to sell assets or depend on emergency food aid to survive. In addition, crop insurance encourages more investment in agricultural inputs leading to higher outputs and income per unit of land, and it enhances farmers’ resilience to bouts of recurrent food insecurity. Overall, it is vital to get households out of poverty.|$|R

30|$|As {{discussed}} {{extensively in}} the literature on adaptation to risks associated with CC (e.g., Barnett and Mahul 2007; Mahul and Skees 2007; Barnett et al. 2008; Giné et al. 2008; Yang 2009; Giné and Yang 2009; Clarke and Dercon 2009; Mahul and Stutley 2010; IFAD 2011; MCII 2013; Cole et al. 2013; Karlan et al. 2014; CCAFS 2014; Smith and Watts 2014), index-based crop insurance represents a very promising agricultural risk management strategy that farmers may use to mitigate adverse climate hazards and natural catastrophes encountered during farming activities. In many parts of the world, various experiences show that implementation of index-based crop insurance policies have been used to support farmers to limit the losses that natural calamities like droughts, floods, variabilities in rainfall drought, flood, variability in temperature, <b>dry</b> spells, <b>hail,</b> and heat waves might cause to crop yields and household income (Kunreuther 1996; Food and Agricultural Organization 2011; Barnett 2014; Patt et al. 2010). For instance, in Kenya, the mobile technology is being used to support farmers through crop insurance. Insurance claims are triggered by data from local weather stations and are distributed in the form of mobile money. Farmers with land as little as 1 acre can use their assets as collateral for this crop insurance via mobile headsets. The mobile technology has tremendous potential to chart the future expansion of such an innovative crop insurance scheme {{in the rest of the}} continent where road accessibility is very limited and weather data precarious, despite the rise of local weather stations in some countries in the continent.|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{differences}} are presented among supercell storms simulated with midlevel and deep dry layers of varying magnitude. Initial patterns are identified {{which should be}} studied more comprehensively using observed or simulated data. These initial results indicate that mixing ratios of small ice particles are most sensitive to the depth of a dry layer rather than to its magnitude, with fewer particles in simulations containing a deep <b>dry</b> layer. <b>Hail</b> from frozen drops may be most abundant when a deep layer is dried, and bursts of hail species reaching low levels may be followed 15 – 20 min later {{by an increase in}} low-level vertical vorticity associated with the mesocyclone. Warm rain occurs repeatedly on the upshear side of the echo appendage, is especially variable in quantity, and is disfavored in simulations with a dry layer at midlevels. Increases in warm rain mixing ratio may be followed 10 – 20 min later by an increase in low-level vertical vorticity, though this association is sensitive to location of the warm rain and concurrent microphysical and dynamical processes. In simulations with substantial dry layers, vertical vorticity was concentrated more rapidly in association with the mesocyclone at low levels. Storms in simulations with deep dry layers produced larger areas of updraft 3 ̆e 10 m s– 1 at 1000 m AGL, and produced strong updraft more quickly than moister soundings. These results may be applicable when storms move into areas with different moisture characteristics from where they form, and should be supplemented by additional microphysical observations...|$|R

40|$|Flash initiations {{within a}} {{supercell}} cluster during 10 – 11 May 2010 in Oklahoma were investigated based on observations from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array and the Norman, Oklahoma, polarimetric radar (KOUN). The flash initiations at positions dominated by graupel, <b>dry</b> snow, small <b>hail</b> and crystals accounted for 44. 3 %, 44. 1 %, 8. 0 % and 3. 0 % {{of the total}} flashes, respectively. During the tornadic stage of the southern supercell in the cluster, flash initiations associated with graupel occupied the main body, the right flank and the forward flank of the supercell, while those associated with dry snow dominated {{the outskirts of the}} adjacent forward anvil, right anvil and rear anvil. The flash initiations associated with small hail were concentrated around the main updraft, particularly toward its front side. Highly dense flash initiations were located in the regions overlying the differential reflectivity (ZDR) arc and right anvil. The average initial height of the flashes decreased gradually from the rear to the front and from the right to the left flanks, while the height range over which initiations occurred reached a maximumat the front of the updraft. The flashes that were initiated in the adjacent forward anvils were largest on average, followed by those in the regions ahead of the updraft and near the ZDR arc. This study supports the concept of charge pockets and further deduces that the pockets in the right anvil are the most abundant and compact due to the frequent flash initiations, small-sized flashes and thin layers including flash initiations...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Geography) Hailstorms are {{well-known}} {{phenomena in}} the summer rainfall region of southern Africa where they cause extensive damage - especially in the agricultural sector. This thesis examines the geography and climatology of hail in the Transvaal. It deals with three main issues, namely a) the spatial and temporal characteristics of hail days (HDs); b) rainfall and atmospheric conditions prevailing during hail events; and c) the geography of hail damage {{as it pertains to}} maize. In the Transvaal, hail day frequency (HDF) increases with altitude and latitude in a non-linear (exponential) manner. Variations in altitude, as reflected in the diverse physiography of the area, account for most of the spatial and temporal variations in hail occurrence. Seven hail regions can be distinguished which differ from one another in terms of the onset times of hail, its seasonal occurrence and annual HDF patterns. In general, most hailstorms occur during November with the peak onset time varying between 16 : 00 and 20 : 00. The most notable finding concerning rain - hail interrelationships, is that rainfall and HDF appear to be inversely related, years/months with high <b>hail</b> incidence being <b>dry</b> and vice versa. Daily and seasonal precipitation characteristics also differ between 'high <b>hail</b> years' (HHYs; <b>dry)</b> and 'low <b>hail</b> years' (LHYs; wet). For instance, during HHYs, the peak hail season is delayed while the rain season peaks earlier. Moreover, while the frequency of convective systems remains nearly the same during HHYs as in 'normal' years, the average precipitation area and the volumetric production decreases significantly. These anomalies appear {{to be the result of}} changes in the large-scale circulation patterns (as reflected by the transition from baroclinic to quasi-barotropic conditions) which influence the precipitation from mesoscale convective systems. It is likely that the Southern Oscillation plays a role in these changes, particularly during November and December. However, although these Southern Oscillation Index (SOl) - HDF associations are weak, they are appreciably stronger than those between the SOl and rainfall. Rainfall characteristics on HDs differ from those of non-hail rain days in that, on HDs, more rain falls and the rain-bearing systems are more extensive. In general, atmospheric conditions are less stable, and the humidity level is higher, on HDs than on other days. Furthermore, HDs are characterized by warm north easterly winds near the surface but cold, dry south westerlies at the 600 hPa level. Above this the south westerlies become progressively stronge...|$|R
