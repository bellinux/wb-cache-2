A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for <b>fiscal</b> <b>space,</b> meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but {{it is not going to}} be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed <b>fiscal</b> <b>space</b> or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} there is an immanent and {{evolving}} relationship between the prevailing form of taxation and the economic geographies of the state. Despite this, the geographic significance of taxation has been obscured by the language in which its historic transformation tends to be couched. Prevailing fiscal systems tend to be presented as essentially static – institutionally and spatially fixed and routinely inscribed within the fixed boundaries and territories of the ‘sovereign’ fiscal state. Any threat to, or change in the nature or geography of the fiscal state tends to be couched in terms of ‘crisis’ – of negative and discontinuous change. This paper contends that these related and essentially conservative discourses of fiscal geography mask the degree to which <b>fiscal</b> <b>spaces</b> are both multiple and continuously evolving. More importantly, it argues, this fluidity and multiplicity does not threaten the stability and viability of state form, but it is an essential process in its maintenance and reproduction. Running counter to the prevailing discourse of the ‘national economy’, the practice of fiscal geography is an under-analysed but key aspect of the historical evolution and transformation of the imagined geographies of economies...|$|R

40|$|The Mapping the Faultlines {{project is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the mechanisms that allow illicit financial flows to occur result from the synergistic relationship between the world’s tax havens and offshore financial centres. At the time the project was proposed these were defined as follows: 1. Tax havens are the legislative, judicial, <b>fiscal</b> and regulatory <b>spaces</b> provided by jurisdictions that encourage the relocation of economic transactions to that domain; 2. An offshore finance centre (OFC) is the commercial response to the provision of those legislative, judicial, <b>fiscal</b> and regulatory <b>spaces</b> by those seeking to profit from the opportunities they provide. The project also set out to identify the characteristics that identify a location as having tax haven status. It soon became apparent that this would be difficult using prevailing language to describe the offshore sector since there was little agreement on what that language actually meant. We therefore decided to reappraise the language of offshore and offer more accurate, and precisely defined terms for use in the Mapping the Faultlines project...|$|R

40|$|This Policy Brief {{discusses}} the growth {{prospects of the}} Central and Eastern European (CEEC) region following the current economic crisis. It argues that the 'integration model of growth' of the CEEC region was characterised by a very high degree of external liberalisation. In one group of economies (mostly the Central European economies) the model {{turned out to be}} successful in that it did not generate strong structural imbalances (in trade and current accounts and in growing private sector savings-investment gaps) prior to the crisis. This was quite different in the other group (mostly the Baltic states and the countries in Southeastern Europe, SEE) where unsustainable imbalances developed in part traced back to historical weaknesses of the tradable sectors and in part to choices of exchange rate regimes, to the importance of remittances and to missing instruments to deal with cross-border financial market integration. The analysis suggests a number of factors which will characterise post-crisis condi-tions in CEECs (such as increased savings rates of the household sector, deleveraging, more restricted <b>fiscal</b> pol-icy <b>space,</b> etc.) and in external factors (lower growth in the most important Western European export markets, more difficult effective entry conditions to the EMU, etc.) and discusses an adjusted policy agenda.

We show how the warning signs of the 1970 s were ignored and the consequences became apparent during the ensuing period of neoliberal hegemony. We contend that promoting increased capital mobility is counterproductive as it reduces macroeconomic ‘policy space’. We introduce a development of the international policy ‘trilemma’ {{in the form of a}} variant of the idea of the ‘quadrilemma’. We suggest that, in most cases, the key policy driving economic growth is fiscal policy but it may be that its unconstrained use (and that of monetary policy) is not possible either under fixed exchange rates or when free capital mobility exists; a nation may face a ‘demi-quadrilemma’. We contend that, in practice, a country can only adopt ‘two from four’; if it chooses to retain free use of monetary and fiscal policy, it must sacrifice both fixed exchange rates and capital mobility. We advocate the rejection of fixed exchange rates and free capital mobility allowing the retention of requisite monetary and <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>space,</b> and that a multinational approach to the capital control policy would effectively contribute to a growth and development strategy...|$|R

40|$|Food {{prices in}} the last decade have seen both an {{increase}} in price levels and in price variability. In the same time period, speculative activity in the agricultural futures market has significantly increased. This thesis asks whether food price levels and volatilities are affected by speculation, and whether regulation can curb the potential effect. This thesis first investigates the welfare impacts of high and volatile prices. It does so because if the impact is limited, there would be a weak argument for introducing regulation. I find that producers benefit from high food prices, whereas consumers are hurt. Next to that, rural households gain relative to urban households. From a macroeconomic perspective, food importing countries have negative impacts on their balance of payments, inflation rates and <b>fiscal</b> breathing <b>space.</b> All these impacts are particularly pronounced in developing countries. This thesis finds that short -term volatilities can have long -term negative consequences for households. Moreover, food producers are less willing to invest in the agricultural system. On a macroeconomic level volatility increases uncertainty and reduces growth. The conclusion is that both high and volatile agricultural prices are welfare reducing. This thesis finds that there are fundamental supply and demand factors that have increased price levels and volatilities over the last decade. However, it also finds that there is a potential role for speculation in driving up agricultural prices. Speculation plays a more definitive role in increasing price volatilities. As high and volatile food prices are welfare reducing, and speculation has a role at least in one of these price developments, this thesis investigates policy options to limit the effect of speculation on food prices. It finds that a transaction tax and position limits are two regulatory options that are likely to curb the effects of speculation on food prices, {{while at the same time}} they do not create very large market distortions...|$|R
