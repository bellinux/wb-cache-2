In both of the schemes the Rovers held large interests-- that is, they held what were called options, for which Anderson Rover had put up large sums of money, and he had likewise induced some friends to let him put up money for them. In order to clinch their hold on the two business propositions Anderson Rover must sign certain papers and have them delivered to the right parties inside of the next three days. Should he fail to do this, then his options on the property would terminate, and Pelter, Japson & Company would be able to step in and gain control. The brokers had at first tried to gain control by getting Anderson Rover to assign his interest in the options, but this the boys' father had refused to do.|$|E

In order to study the effects of different levels of water stress on some element of the plant, O. basilicum was subjected to deficit irrigation using four treatments viz. control, irrigated with 70 % of soil water capacity (SWC), Treatment 1, irrigated with 50 % SWC, Treatment 2, irrigated with 30 % SWC and Treatment 3, irrigated with 10 % SWC. Plants were divided into four growth stages, Viz., vegetative (35 days after sowing, DAS), pre-flowering (49 DAS), flowering (63 DAS) and seed setting (77 DAS). Essential elements of leaves were investigated under these irrigation treatments at each growth stages. The results {{at the end of each}} growth stage indicated that there is no significant reduction in essential elements quantities compared to that of full irrigation control.

40|$|Traditionally, <b>irrigation</b> pumping <b>plants</b> {{have been}} tested using an {{instantaneous}} appraoch, which tests performance parameters over {{a very short time}} interval. Using this method, the tester measures the necessary work and energy use parameters to calculate the desired pumping plant performance values. The primary limitation of this approach is its inability to determine the season long efficiency of an <b>irrigation</b> pumping <b>plant.</b> A new approach to evaluating <b>irrigation</b> pumping <b>plant</b> performance is the use of pump monitoring systems which use high frequency, real-time data collection and telemetry to relay information directly from the pump to the user. This method of testing essentially conducts a continuous pumping plant performance evaluation. Throughout a typical irrigation season, a single pumping plant typically operates at a wide range of total dynamic heads as a result of changes in operational conditions due to factors such as aquifer drawdown and irrigation demand changes. When coupled with telemetry, this approach to <b>irrigation</b> pumping <b>plant</b> testing can provide real-time feedback to the irrigator on pumping plant performance, even as the operating conditions of the system changes throughout the season. Nearly 100 pumping years of diesel and electric pumping plant data was evaluated over four irrigation seasons using a network of these pump monitoring systems. Annual averages and trends in water pumping flow rate, cost of water per unit volume pumped, and efficiency {{as a percentage of the}} Nebraska Pumping Plant Performance Criteria, among other performance values were reported.

The location of the experiment was Isfahan University of Technology Research Station in Shervedan Field. The irrigation treatments were: I 1 - <b>Irrigation</b> after <b>planting</b> I 2 - <b>Irrigation</b> after <b>planting</b> and at the stage of full standing of plants I 3 - <b>Irrigation</b> after <b>planting,</b> full standing of plants, and anthesis and I 4 - <b>Irrigation</b> after <b>planting,</b> full standing of plants, anthesis, and beginning of grain filling stage. The stages of development (from emergence to anthesis) occurred simultaneously in all treatments. However, the water deficit in I 1 and I 2 caused the plants to reach their physiological maturity 5 days sooner than the other two treatments. The time intervals between anthesis and physiological maturity in I 4 and I 3 treatments were 12 days and 5 days longer than those in the other two treatments, respectively. The grain yield of I 1 and I 2 were approximately 60 % of I 3 and no significant difference was observed between the grain yields of I 1 and I 2 treatments, nor between I 3 and I 4 treatments. The grain yields in I 3 and I 4 treatments were about 1742 and 1800 Kg/ha, respectively. The number of umbels per plant, the most important grain yield component, was greater in I 3 and I 4 than the other two irrigation regimes, but the number of seeds per umbel and 1000 -seed weight of I 3 and I 4 were lower than that in I 1 and I 2 treatments...|$|R
