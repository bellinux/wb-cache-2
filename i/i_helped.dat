5|$|Van Gogh's fame {{reached its}} first peak in Austria and Germany before World War <b>I,</b> <b>helped</b> by the {{publication}} of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist Irving Stone wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled Lust for Life, based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the 1956 film further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.|$|E

All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

In an interview in the November 14, 2009 issue of Billboard, Bieber explained the meaning behind the song stating, [...] "It's a ballad about the feelings I had when my parents split up and how <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> my family get through it.

[...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2.

500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living." ...|$|E
500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these words about the club <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> to build".|$|E
500|$|In January 1942, SS-Untersturmführer Herbert Andorfer was {{appointed}} to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy. That month, German military authorities demanded the camp be cleared of Jews {{in order to accommodate}} the growing number of captives taken in battles with the Partisans. By February the camp held about 6,500 inmates, ten percent of whom were Romani. In early March, Andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to the camp from Berlin. The Sauer van had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner. Stricken with guilt over having to {{play a central role in}} the murder of the Jewish inmates, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer; this was denied. In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he made announcements intended to convince the prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions. Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening climbed into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, SS-Scharführers Meier and Götz, distributed candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, the doors of the van were sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that one of the drivers exited the van and crawled underneath it, diverting its exhaust into the interior of the vehicle and killing the inmates with carbon monoxide gas. The van was then taken to the Avala firing range, where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by Serbian and Romani prisoners. Such gassings became routine, and the gas van arrived every day except Sunday. Rumours quickly circulated about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade and even some Serbians. Consequently, the gas van was nicknamed the [...] "soul killer" [...] (...) by the Serb population exposed to these rumours. It is thought that the gassings took the lives of as many as 8,000 inmates, mostly women and children. The seven Serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading the murdered inmates from the van were shot after the gassings stopped, but the gravedigger, a Serb named Vladimir Milutinović, survived. [...] "Eighty-one or eighty-two trenches were prepared and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> dig all of them," [...] he recalled. [...] "At least 100 people [...] into each trench These ones were only for those suffocated in the truck. We dug a different set for those who were shot." ...|$|E
