40|$|AbstractThe ATP-inhibited {{potassium}} (KATP) {{channel is}} assembled from four inward rectifier potassium (Kir 6. x) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SURx) subunits. The inhibitory action of ATP is mediated {{by at least}} two distinct functional domains within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Kir 6. 2. The G 334 D mutation of Kir 6. 2 virtually eliminates ATP-dependent gating with no effect on ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role in linkage of the site to the gate or in the ATP binding site, itself. The T 171 A mutation of Kir 6. 2 strongly disrupts both ATP-dependent and ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role for T 171 in the gating step. A neighboring mutation, I 182 Q, virtually eliminates ATP inhibition, but its effect on ligand-independent gating remained unknown. We have now characterized both the Ki values for inhibition by ATP and the ligand-independent gating kinetics of 15 substitutions at position 182.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the working brain as a network, it is essential to identify the mechanisms by which information is gated between regions. We here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8 – 13 [*]Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30 – 100 [*]Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas. In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework.

A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo, ketanserin (40 [*]mg p. o.), psilocybin (260 [*]μg/kg p. o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced order. Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (5 D-ASC), and the Color-Word Stroop Test. Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals (30 [*]ms), increased all 5 D-ASC scores, and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM 404 on three rat models of anxiety: elevated plus maze, defensive withdrawal and separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. AM 404 (1 - 5 mg kg - 1, intraperitoneal (i. p.)) exerted dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in the three models. These behavioral effects were associated with increased levels of anandamide, but not 2 -AG, in the prefrontal cortex and were prevented by the CB 1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (SR 141716 A), suggesting that they were dependent on anandamide-mediated activation of CB 1 cannabinoid receptors. We also evaluated whether AM 404 might influence motivation (in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test), sensory reactivity (acoustic startle reflex) and sensorimotor <b>gating</b> (prepulse <b>inhibition</b> (PPI) of the startle reflex). In the CPP test, AM 404 (1. 25 - 10 mg kg - 1, i. p.) elicited rewarding effects in rats housed under enriched conditions, but not in rats kept in standard cages. Moreover, AM 404 did not alter reactivity to sensory stimuli or cause overt perceptual distortion, as suggested by its lack of effect on startle or PPI of startle.

A number of different structures like the cerebral cortex, the red nucleus and the cerebellum have been suggested as candidate structures for mediating this <b>gating.</b> The <b>inhibition</b> of the responses of the inferior olivary neurons from the red nucleus has been studied extensively and anatomical studies have found specific areas within the cuneate nucleus to be target areas for projections from the magnocellular red nucleus. In addition, GABA-ergic cells projecting from the cuneate nucleus to the inferior olive have been found. We therefore tested if direct stimulation of the cuneate nucleus had inhibitory effects on a climbing fiber field response, evoked by electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract, recorded {{on the surface of the}} cerebellum. When the pyramidal tract stimulation was preceded by weak electrical stimulation (5 - 20 A) within the cuneate nucleus, the amplitude of the climbing fiber field potential was strongly suppressed (appx. 90 % reduction). The time course of this suppression was similar to that found after red nucleus stimulation, with a peak suppression occurring at 70 ms after the cuneate stimulation. Application of CNQX (6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione, disodium salt) on the cuneate nucleus blocked the suppression almost completely.

Here, we report that a point mutation at position 204 in the S 2 –S 3 loop of Rolf and a mouse CNG channel (Molf) found in olfactory epithelium and heart, increased DAG sensitivity to that of the Brod channel. Mutation of this residue from the wild-type glycine to a glutamate (Molf G 204 E) or aspartate (Molf G 204 D) gave dramatic increases in DAG sensitivity without changing the apparent cGMP or cAMP affinities or efficacies. However, unlike the wild-type olfactory channels, these mutants demonstrated voltage-dependent gating with obvious activation and deactivation kinetics. Interestingly, the mutants were also more sensitive to inhibition by the local anesthetic, tetracaine. Replacement of the position 204 glycine with a tryptophan residue (Rolf G 204 W) not only gave voltage-dependent gating and an increased sensitivity to DAG and tetracaine, but also showed reduced apparent agonist affinity and cAMP efficacy.

These studies indicate a clear dose-response relationship for tumor control with escalating dose of SBRT. While late toxicity requires further careful assessment, acute and subacute toxicity are generally acceptable. Radiographic and local tissue effects consistent with bronchial or vascular damage and downstream collapse with fibrosis are common. While such radiographic changes are most often asymptomatic, more frequent and sometimes debilitating toxicity has been observed for patients with tumors near the central airways. ConclusionsProspective trials using SBRT in North America have been able to identify potent tolerant dose levels and confirm their efficacy in patients with medically inoperable disease. Although mechanisms of this injury remain elusive, ongoing prospective trials offer the hope of finding the ideal application for SBRT in treating pulmonary targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{liability}} genes of the world’s 2 major psy-chotic disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder I (BP-I), {{has been extremely}} difficult even though evidence suggests that both are highly heritable. This difficulty {{is due to the}} complex and multifactorial nature of these dis-orders. They encompass several intermediate phenotypes, some overlapping across the 2 psychotic disorders that jointly and/or interactively produce the clinical manifesta-tions. Research of the past few decades has identified sev-eral neurophysiological deficits in schizophrenia that frequently occur before the onset of psychosis. These in-clude abnormalities in smooth pursuit eye movements, P 50 sensory <b>gating,</b> prepulse <b>inhibition,</b> P 300, mismatch negativity, and neural synchrony. Evidence suggests that many of these physiological deficits are distinct from each other. They are stable, mostly independent of symp-tom state and medications (with some exceptions) and are also observed in non-ill relatives. This suggests a familial and perhaps genetic nature. Some deficits are also observed in the BP-I probands {{and to a lesser extent}} their relatives. These deficits in physiological measures may represent the intermediate phenotypes that index small effects of genes (and/or environmental factors). The use of these measures in genetic studies may help the hunt for psychosis liability genes and clarify the extent to which the 2 major psychotic disorders share etio-pathophysiology. In spite of the rich body of work describing these neurophysiological measures in psychotic disorders, challenges remain: Many of the neu-rophysiological phenotypes are still relatively complex and are associated with low heritability estimates. Further re-finement of these physiological phenotypes is needed that could identify specific underlying physiological deficits and thereby improve their heritability estimates. The extent to which these neurophysiological deficits are unique or overlap across BP-I and schizophrenia is unclear. And fi-nally, the clinical and functional consequences of the neu-rophysiological deficits both in the probands and their relatives are not well described...|$|R
40|$|As quantum {{computers}} edge {{closer to}} viability, it becomes necessary to create logic synthesis and minimization algorithms that {{take into account}} the particular aspects of quantum computers that differentiate them from classical computers. Since quantum computers can be functionally described as reversible computers with superposition and entanglement, both advances in reversible synthesis and increased utilization of superposition and entanglement in quantum algorithms will increase the power of quantum computing. One necessary component of any practical quantum computer is the computation of irreversible functions. However, very little work has been done on algorithms that synthesize and minimize irreversible functions into a reversible form. In this thesis, we present and implement a pair of algorithms that extend the best published solution to these problems by taking advantage of Product-Sum EXOR (PSE) gates, the reversible generalization of <b>inhibition</b> <b>gates,</b> which we have introduced in previous work [1, 2]. We show that these gates, combined with our novel synthesis algorithms, result in much lower quantum costs over a wide variety of functions as compared to our competitors, especially on incompletely specified functions. Furthermore, this solution has applications for milti-valued and multi-output functions...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been made}} on the <b>inhibition</b> <b>gate</b> and ATP site of the K ir 6. 2 subunit of the K ATP channel, but {{little is known about}} conformational coupling between the two. ATP site mutations dramatically disrupt ATPdependent gating without effect on ligand-independent gating, observed as interconversions between active burst and inactive interburst conformations in the absence of ATP. This suggests that linkage between site and gate is conditionally dependent on ATP occupancy. We studied all substitutions at position 334 of the ATP site in K ir 6. 2 �C 26 that express in Xenopus oocytes. All substitutions disrupted ATP-dependent gating by 10 -fold or more. Only positive-charged arginine or lysine at 334, however, slowed ligand-independent gating from the burst, and this was in some but not all patches. Moreover, the polycationic peptide protamine reversed the slowed gating from the burst of 334 R mutant channels, and speeded the slow gating from the burst of wild-type SUR 1 /K ir 6. 2 in the absence of ATP. Our results support a two-step ligand-dependent linkage mechanism for K ir 6. 2 channels in which ATP-occupied sites function to electrostatically dissociate COOH-terminal domains from the membrane, then as in all K ir channels, free COOH-terminal domains and inner M 2 helices transit to a lower energy state for gate closure...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{operations}} in sensory processing is the computation of the tempo-ral order of excitation of sensors. Motivated by the discrepancy between models and experiments at high signal contrast, we obtain families of algorithms by solutions of a general set of equations that define temporal order detection as an input-to-output relationship. Delays and nonlinear operations are the basis of all algorithms found, but different algorithmic structures exist when the operations are multiplications, OR gates, different types of AND-NOT logical gates or concatenated AND-NOT gates. Among others, we obtain the Hassenstein-Reichardt model, a network using a multiplicative operation that has been proposed to explain fly optomotor behavior. We also find extensions of the Barlow-Levick model (based on a AND-NOT <b>gate</b> with delayed <b>inhibition</b> and non-delayed excitation as inputs), originally proposed to explain the bipolar cell response of the rabbit retina to motion stimuli. In the ex-tended models there are two more steps, another AND-NOT gate and a subtraction or two subtractions, that make the model responsive only to motion. In response to low-contrast inputs, the concatenated AND-NOT gates or the AND-NOT gate followed by a subtraction in these new models act as the multiplicative operation in the Hassenstein-Reichardt model. At high contrast the new models behave like the Hassenstein-Reichardt model except that they are independent of contrast as observed experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) enhance cAMP and/or cGMP {{signaling}} via {{reducing the}} degradation of these cyclic nucleotides. Both cAMP and cGMP signaling are essential {{for a variety of}} cellular functions and exert their effects both pre- and post-synaptically. Either of these second messengers relays and amplifies incoming signals at receptors on the cell surface making them important elements in signal transduction cascades and essential in cellular signaling in a variety of cell functions including neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection. Consequently, these processes can be influenced by PDE-Is as they increase cAMP and/or cGMP concentrations. PDE-Is have been considered as possible therapeutic agents to treat impaired memory function linked to several brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease (AD). This review will, however, focus on the possible role of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in cognitive decline beyond the memory domain. Here we will discuss the involvement of PDEs on three related domains: attention, information filtering (sensory- and sensorimotor <b>gating)</b> and response <b>inhibition</b> (drug-induced hyperlocomotion). Currently, these are emerging cognitive domains in the field of PDE research. Here we discuss experimental studies and the potential beneficial effects of PDE-I drugs on these cognitive domains, as effects of PDE-Is on these domains could potentially influence effects on memory performance. Overall, PDE 4 seems to be the most promising target for all domains discussed in this review...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{amygdala}} {{is involved}} in the coordination of stress but is also an important gatekeeper involved in the regulation of vigilance. The amygdala is structurally complex, consisting of several nuclei with specific functions in the affective response to environmental stimuli. There are indications that the medial amygdaloid nucleus may be a pivotal player in acute responses to emotional environmental stimuli. METHODS: The present study therefore aimed to study the effects of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the medial amygdala on unconditioned anxiety-related behavior as well as a sensorimotor <b>gating</b> parameter (prepulse <b>inhibition,</b> PPI) in rats. Anxiety-related behavior was assessed with the use of stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH), light-enhanced startle (LES) and open field behavior. RESULTS: Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the medial amygdala decreased the SIH response and anxiety-related open field behavior. In contrast, lesioned animals displayed augmented LES and disrupted PPI. No changes in basal locomotor activity, body temperature and acoustic startle were found between lesioned and sham animals. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the medial amygdala is an important player in response to acute environmental stimuli. Decreased unconditioned psychological stress responses were found, whereas LES was enhanced and sensorimotor processing was disrupted. However, considering the existing data on basolateral amygdala involvement in PPI and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis involvement in LES, local infusion studies into the MeA should be performed to further substantiate these findings...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoEKO) mice were {{characterized}} behaviorally {{to evaluate the}} impact of apolipoprotein E deficiency on spatial learning and memory function at different ages. Wild type and knockout mice were tested in two tasks assessing spatial memory function, Morris water maze (MWM) and Radial arm maze (RAM). Both young and aged apoEKO mice backcrossed six generations displayed deficits in the MWM. However, young and aged 10 th generation apoEKO mice did not display any deficits in the MWM or the RAM when spatial cues {{that could be used}} to solve these tasks were provided. Removal of spatial cues after training had occurred also did not result in an impairment. In contrast, apoEKO mice were impaired when spatial cues were removed from the beginning of training. This result suggests that these mice are less able to utilize non-spatial cues to solve these tasks. The impairments observed in the MWM and RAM were not the result of impaired reference memory function, but rather appeared to arise from a dysfunction in working memory. Additional tests assessing sensorimotor <b>gating</b> function (Prepulse <b>inhibition),</b> and emotionality (the Open field, the Elevated plus maze) suggested that these cognitive deficits did not arise from alterations in sensorimotor gating function or emotionality, as both young and aged apoEKO mice performed at levels similar to those observed in their aged C 57 BL/ 6 J control groups...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) and its {{structurally}} related proteins {{are involved in}} the developmental regulation of various brain neurons, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We have reported that EGF and EGF receptor abnormalities in both the brain tissues and peripheral blood of schizophrenic patients, which might be implicated in dopaminergic dysfunction of this disease. EGF overexpression in transgenic (Tg) mice displayed alterations in physical development, behavioral abnormalities in sensorimotor <b>gating</b> and prepulse <b>inhibition</b> of acoustic startle at the adult stage. In the present study, weinvestigated psychostimulant sensitivity of EGF Tg mice. At the adult stage, mice were challenged with cocaine (20 mg/kg, i. p. for 5 days), and locomotor activity was examined (day 1, 3, 5). EGF Tg mice enhanced behavioral responses to cocaine. Control mice gradually increased locomotor responses to cocaine during their daily injections, whereas EGF Tg mice required repeated injections and exhibited time delay in cocaine responses. Repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine was induced behavioral sensitization in EGF Tg mice. In addition, the expression of monoamine transporter in the globus pallidus of EGF Tg mice altered compared to that of control animals. These results suggest that drug addiction might be implicated in dopaminergic neuron as monoamine transporter. Our findings indicate a potential link between EGF receptor activation and drug addiction. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
