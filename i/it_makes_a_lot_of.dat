Well, on that red stone there was something cut; and father he took it to a chap as understands about those things, who got some red wax, and hotted it, and dropped some of it on a paper, and then squeezed this 'ere stone down on it, and looks at the mark through a eye-glass, and he tells father that it was a hand with three lingers holding a dagger." ...|$|E

5000|$|Toby Manning, {{the match}} referee for AlphaGo vs. Fan Hui, has {{described}} the program's style as [...] "conservative". AlphaGo's playing style strongly favours greater probability of winning by fewer points over lesser probability of winning by more points. Its strategy of maximising its probability of winning is distinct from what human players tend to do which is to maximise territorial gains, and explains some of its odd-looking moves. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> opening moves that have never or seldom been made by humans, while avoiding many second-line opening moves that human players like to make.

Ellen Jones of The Independent said: [...] "The laboriously regional script didnt make it any easier.

5000|$|.....without {{a guitar}} player you can't {{rely on the}} {{standard}} hooks that punk rock and rock n' roll in general relies on. The guitar player - the guitar god quote unquote - was such a focus {{for so long that}} by the nature of not having a guitar player, the bass and the drums have to do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more. <b>It</b> also <b>makes</b> the vocals more important, or at least <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more room for the vocals. You don't have guitar solos, you don't have the wash of high end. And the things you do on the drums are different, if you just did a straight four beat on the drums it would get kinda dull after awhile. It isn't as though bass guitar hasn't been a prominent instrument at times in other bands but it made us approach things differently, our song structure couldn't just be verse-chorus-verse. It had everything to do with how our sound got off to a unique start.|$|R

5000|$|Carr deplored {{the rise}} of Structuralism. Carr wrote there was the structuralist approach, which Carr called a [...] "horizontal" [...] way of {{understanding}} history [...] "which analyses a society {{in terms of the}} functional or structural inter-relation of its parts". Against it, there was what Carr called the [...] "vertical" [...] approach [...] "which analyses it society in terms of where it has come from and where it is going". Through Carr was willing to allow that a structural approach had some advantages, he wrote: [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> difference which attracts historian's main emphasis and concern. This depends partly, no doubt, on his temperament, but largely on the environment in which he works. We live in a society which thinks of change chiefly as change for the worse, dreads it and prefers the [...] "horizontal" [...] view which calls only for minor adjustments".|$|E
5000|$|Another trend among craft brewers is {{to package}} {{at least some}} of their {{products}} in aluminum cans instead of traditional bottles including the large Growler (jug). For example, Ottawa’s Beyond The Pale Brewing Co. once used only bottles, including one and two litre growlers, but the company added a canning system in 2015. [...] "If you are trying to put out a premium product, it’s better for the beer to be in cans. It’s more convenient, it’s better for the environment, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sense," [...] said co-owner Rob McIsaac. Most of their beer is now sold in cans. Cameron’s Brewing Company in Mississauaga, Ontario also sell the majority of their beer in cans. Craft brewer Black Bridge in Saskatchewan is strongly in favour of cans, due to the lower weight ("we can transport more beer while reducing our carbon footprint") and much greater resistance to light and oxygen that can reduce shelf life in addition to lower packaging and shipping costs.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Darlan deal" [...] proved highly controversial, as Darlan {{had been}} a notorious {{collaborator}} with Germany. General de Gaulle and his Free France organization were outraged; so were the pro-Allied conspirators who had seized Algiers. Some high American and British officials objected, and there was furious criticism by newspapers and politicians. Roosevelt defended it (using wording suggested by Churchill) as 'a temporary expedient, justified only by the stress of battle'. Churchill won round a secret session of the House of Commons, saying that Eisenhower's recognition of Darlan was right, and even it was not quite right, it had meant French rifles being pointed not at the Allies, but at the Axis: [...] "I am sorry to have to mention a point like this, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> difference to a soldier whether a man fires his gun at him, or at an enemy..." [...] Later, American historian Arthur Funk maintained that the [...] "deal with Darlan" [...] was misunderstood by the critics {{at the time as}} an opportunistic improvisation. Funk claimed Darlan had been in talks with American diplomats for months about switching sides, and when the opportunity came he did so promptly. The [...] "deal" [...] thus {{was the result of a}} long and carefully considered Allied plan for reaching a political and military accord with Vichy. It followed a model drawn up in London and already approved at the highest levels.|$|E

5000|$|Cantrell told RIP {{magazine}} in 1993 {{that not all}} of the lyrics have drugs reference:I think [...] "Sickman" [...] is not that bad. I thought most of the hassle would come from [...] "Junkhead" [...] and [...] "Godsmack". Those songs are put in sequence on the second side those five songs from [...] "Junkhead" [...] to [...] "Angry Chair" [...] for a reason: Because it tells a story. It starts out with a really young naive attitude with [...] "Junkhead", like drugs are great, sex is great, rock'n' roll, yeah! Then, as it progresses, there's a little bit of growing up {{and a little bit of}} a realization of what it's about, and that ain't what it's about. I've been using this phrase a lot, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sense: It's really easy to die; it's really hard to live. It takes a lot of guts to live. It doesn't take a lot of guts to die. Those five and [...] "Sickman" [...] are the only ones talking about that typeof mentality drugs. The rest of the stuff is not like that at all. [...] "Rain When I Die" [...] is a song to a girl. There's a lot of stuff on it. A good portion of it is a story, and it's meant to be that way. It's kind of overwhelming and unpleasant at times, unsettling maybe, but that's why all those songs are together. Even if it's disturbing, it's not something anybody else needs to worry about or the way somebody else needs to live their life.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{continued}} to regularly perform around the UK, and in promotion of Quirk Out, underwent a promotional national tour. When {{the album was}} released on cassette, the band played seventeen gigs in April and May 1987. Roy Weard became the band's tour manager for this era, with Weard later reflecting: [...] "I knew Rich Bishop, who was managing the band {{at the time and}} he suggested me for the first big Stump tour. It was immediately after Quirk Out came out. I went along to the studio to watch them rehearse, I thought, can these guys play, this doesn’t make any sense. I went home and listened to the album and I went back the following day and listened to them again and I went, oh, I see <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sense. It took a day to get my head around the music. The more I heard it, the more sense it made. The immediate impression was, what’s going on? The time signatures and the way it was all put together, the way that the bass led most of it, and Chris filled in on guitar round the edges, and then there was this floating melody line over the top that Mick always used to do." [...] McKahey said [...] "we were headlining the Town & Country, Kentish Town which was big, the Astoria, big headline shows. We always did very well in Holland and Belgium, we did well in Germany, we always did well in cities like Manchester, Glasgow, Nottingham, Newcastle, and we did well in London." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "'Soul' is a {{word that}} has {{probably}} taken more of a beating {{in the past five years}} than most of the words in the English language have taken during the past one-hundred years. And still, no one has come up with a generally accepted definition of the term. Billy Paul says, 'Soul is just being me,' and I think that's the one definition I can accept without reservation.In trying to analyze the electrifying style of Billy Paul, the closest one can come to breaking it down is to say that the style is simply him - emotional, urgent, compelling and the sound of the times with a definite intertexture of the gospel mode.From the very beginning, Billy was always fascinated by the phrasings and seemingly limitless range of horns. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sense, because one of the first things that strikes a listener hearing him for the first time is the horn-like quality of his voice, particularly in the way he phrases the lyric. This is undoubtedly why musician Cecil Payne said that Billy Paul sounds 'just like a flute.'From the frenetic pace of Toots Thielemans' jazz standard, [...] "Bluesette," [...] to the haunting approach of [...] "Somewhere," [...] Billy Paul runs the gamut of versatility. [...] "Feeling Good," [...] a big production number, is notable for the dominating figure created by the piano, drums and bass which makes for an almost hymnal effect."Just in Time," [...] which starts off with Billy accompanied only by bassist Bill Collick, gives the whole group an opportunity to have a ball, as do [...] "That's Life," [...] "Billy Boy," [...] "Don't Think Twice," [...] and [...] "Missing You."But easily, the top number on this album has got to be [...] "On a Clear Day." [...] Arranged by pianist Stanley Johnson (as are all the numbers) [...] "Clear Day" [...] has been given an unusual Latin background, and so startling is the effect that one cannot help wondering why it was never done before.All in all, an auspicious introduction to a new and exciting talent, Billy Paul - a young man who will probably be making fine albums, like this one, forever.Joe HunterWHAT-FM RADIOPhiladelphia, Penna.|$|E
