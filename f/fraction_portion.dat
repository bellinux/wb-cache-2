Hemograms from all dogs showed leukocytosis with marked lymphocytosis. Lymphocytes {{were characterized by}} abundant basophilic cytoplasm containing distinct granules which varied in size and number. Electron microscopically the granules were membrane-bound with an electron-dense core. Lymphocytes from one dog were positive for alkaline phosphatase activity, and lymphocytes from another dog were positive for alpha naphthyl butyrate esterase activity. Lymphocytes from one dog were positive for surface receptors for the crystalline <b>fraction</b> <b>portion</b> of gamma immunoglobulins. Large granular lymphocytes (LGL's) in people rep-resent a morphologically distinct population of pe-ripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by abundant pale blue cytoplasm that contains prominent azuro-philic granules. zo These cells represent about 10 % of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and are respon-sible {{for the majority of}} natural killer cell activity and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity expressed by periph...|$|E
40|$|The proinflammatory {{consequences}} of obesity {{are thought to}} be due, in part, to macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. There are, however, potential antiinflammatory {{consequences of}} obesity that include obesity-associated up-regulation of IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 RA). Here we show that obesity-associated up-regulation of IL- 1 RA speeds recovery from hypoxia. We found that high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice recovered from acute hypoxia 5 times faster than normal-diet-fed (ND) mice. HFD mice had a 10 -fold increase in serum IL- 1 RA when compared with ND mice. White adipose tissue (WAT) was a significant source of IL-RA, generating 330 ± 77 pg/mg protein in HFD mice as compared with 15 ± 5 pg/mg protein in ND mice. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from HFD mice showed little difference in IL- 1 RA production when compared with ND mice, but WAT macrophages from HFD mice generated 11 -fold more IL- 1 RA than those from ND mice. When ND mice were given an ip transfer of the stromal vascular <b>fraction</b> <b>portion</b> of WAT from HFD mice, serum IL- 1 RA increased 836 % and recovery from acute hypoxia was faster than in mice that did not receive a stromal vascular fraction transfer. To determine whether IL- 1 RA was important to this accelerated recovery, ND mice were administered exogenous IL- 1 RA prior to hypoxia, and their recovery matched that of HFD mice. Inversely, when IL- 1 RA was immunoabsorbed in HFD mice with IL- 1 RA antiserum, recovery from acute hypoxia was attenuated. Taken together these data demonstrate that HFD-induced obesity speeds recovery from hypoxia due to obesity-associated up-regulation of IL- 1 RA...|$|E

Bacteriol. 89 : 1291 – 1298. 1965. —The highly immunogenic particulate fraction obtained from mechanically ruptured {{cells of the}} H 37 Ra strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was suspended and centrifuged at 20, 360 × g. The supernatant liquid from this centrifugation was centrifuged at 56, 550 × g to remove the larger particles, and the supernatant liquid from this was centrifuged at 144, 000 × g to obtain a ribosomal fraction. The sediments from the first two centrifugations were highly immunogenic, but the ribosomal fraction showed only slight capacity to immunize mice. However, when the ribosomal fraction was mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, the immunogenic activity was equivalent to the particulate fraction from which it was prepared. To test the hypothesis that some membranous substance in the particulate fraction was acting as an adjuvant for the smaller particles in the ribosomal <b>fraction,</b> <b>portions</b> of the particulate fraction were treated separately {{with each of the}} membrane-disrupting agents, sodium deoxycholate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and 1 m sodium chloride. The treated materials were then centrifuged at 144, 000 × g, and the sediments were tested for immunogenicity both with and without the addition of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Without the adjuvant, the immunizing activities were very weak or absent; with the adjuvant, they were equivalent to that of the particulate fraction from which they were prepared. Other factors which have been found to damage or destroy membranes, such as freezing and thawing, and heat, also significantly decreased the immunogenic {{activity of}} the particulate fraction unless it was incorporated into Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The larger particles which sedimented at 56, 550 × g were also treated with sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium chloride. Again, immunogenicity was greatly reduced but was fully restored by use of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The data suggest, then, that the immunizing component of the particulate fraction is a substance (ribosomal?) which sediments at 144, 000 × g, but for maximal immunizing activity a labile, possibly membranous, moiety of the mycobacterial cell, which has the properties of an adjuvant, is required...|$|R

30|$|At long {{distances}} (∼ 1 m to 10 m) {{from the fire}} front, the dominant component of the energy field is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 1.5 µm to 20 µm. This wavelength region is characteristic of radiators in the 1200 K to 1500 K maximum temperature range of flames from diffusion limited wildland fuel material (J. Cohen, Forest Service, personal communication). In recent laboratory and field experiments, the radiative <b>fraction,</b> that <b>portion</b> of the total energy released as electromagnetic radiation, {{was found to be}} in the range of 10 % to 30 % (Roberts et al. 2005; Smith and Wooster 2005; Wooster et al. 2005; Freeborn et al. 2008; R.L.

Although the radiative component of the fire energy field may not be the dominant mode of energy transport, it is certainly the most easily measurable, especially at long standoff distances, for example, using airborne or satellite remote sensing. Infrared (IR) radiation is also a direct physical measure (first order). Because long-wave IR penetrates smoke and can propagate over {{long distances}}, we will use this component of the fire energy field as a measurable analog for the entire energy field. This method is not without its drawbacks, however, because the radiative fraction may be a function {{of the nature of the}} fire (intensity, fuel moisture, etc.) and relating the radiated power to a parameter like fuel consumption may be problematic. More experiments are required to determine the radiative fraction as a function of fire type, fuel materials, and other combustion conditions.|$|R

40|$|A {{chemical}} dissolution method {{based on}} different leaching rates of kamacite, taenite and tetrataenite in concentrated HF {{was developed for}} isolating metal phases from non-magnetic minerals (mainly silicates) in chondritic meteorites, and for separating taenite from kamacite. This method was applied to an Antarctic chondrite, ALH- 77231 (L 6), to study the elemental distributions between metal and non-magnetic phases and between taenite and kamacite. The separated phases {{as well as the}} bulk metal were studied by Mossbauer spectrometry and by INAA. Mossbauer spectra of ^ Fe show that our procedure is efficient in removing silicates from metal and separating taenite from kamacite. The existence of tetrataenite and the absence of disordered taenite in ALH- 77231 metals imply that the parent body of ALH- 77231 has not experienced severe shock events that redistribute elements among different phases. Thus, element distributions among different phases reflect, in general, the metamorphic history of ALH- 77231. INAA results show that siderophile elements are differently distributed between taenite and kamacite. Most siderophiles have very strong to moderate affinities to taenite, while Co is enriched in kamacite. Refractory siderophile elements seem to behave as an individual group. Distribution of Ir between the metal and the non-magnetic fractions implies that a portion of Ir is present in the silicate <b>fraction.</b> This <b>portion</b> of Ir cannot be attributed to the contamination of FeNi metal in the silicates. While the Os/Ir rations in the metals of ALH- 77231 are in agreement with the CI value, the Re/Ir rations are significantly higher than the CI value, indicating that Re is fractionated from Ir and Os, between the metal and the non-magnetic fractions.

To be physiologically relevant, such proteins must either be present in high concentration in bile or have a potent promoting activity. The current study explored several of the more abundant but unexamined biliary proteins based upon their also having sufficiently high serum concentrations that antibodies were available for both their isolation and quantitation. Methods: Protein purification was accomplished by immunoaffinity chromatography of bile followed by delipidation. Con A affinity chromatography of bile was used to obtain the bound <b>fraction,</b> a <b>portion</b> of which was delipidated. Crystallization-promoting activity of both the purified proteins and Con A-bound glycoprotein fractions (CABG) was measured by a photometric crystal growth assay. A competitive antibody-capture ELISA assay was developed to measure concentrations of alpha(1) -antitrypsin, transferrin, and haptoglobin in native bile. Results: At their relevant physiological concentrations, biliary haptoglobin (15 mu g/ml) had a crystallization-promoting activity twice that of the biliary IgM (75 mu g/ml) used as a reference standard (P < 0. 05). Biliary transferrin (20 mu g/ml) had only modest promoting activity (P < 0. 05). Biliary alpha(1) -antitrypsin (50 mu g/ml), by contrast, showed no promoting activity. Delipidation of the CABG fraction decreased its promoting activity by 75 %. Biliary haptoglobin accounts for about 30 % of delipidated total CABG-promoting activity. Conclusions: Biliary haptoglobin at its physiological concentration has a highly potent crystallization-promoting activity and thus becomes a candidate for major attention in understanding gallstone pathogenesis. Biliary lipids associated with CABG account for a major portion of the cholesterol-crystallization-promoting activity of this fraction...|$|R

Fractions 12 and 13 exhibited significant (P< 0. 01) reduction in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, decreasing the number of writhes by 66. 67 % and 65. 22 % respectively and comparable with 100 mg/kg aspirin (65. 22 %). From fraction 12, a compound was isolated and identified as sitosteryl- 6 -β-D-glucoside- 6 ’-palmitate by 1 H, 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopies. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate antiplasmodial column fractions of P. niruri with analgesic activity and identify sitosteryl glucoside palmitate as a chemical marker of activity...|$|R
40|$|HDL has anti-atherogenic properties, and plasma {{levels of}} HDL {{cholesterol}} correlate inversely with risk of coronary artery disease. HDL reportedly {{functions as a}} cofactor to the anticoagulant activated protein C (APC) in the degradation of factor Va (FVa). The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the mechanism by which HDL functions as cofactor to APC. Consistent with a previous report, HDL isolated from human plasma by ultracentrifugation was found to stimulate APC-mediated degradation of FVa. However, further purification of HDL by gel filtration revealed that the stimulating activity was not a property of HDL. Instead, the stimulating activity eluted completely separately from HDL in the high-molecular-weight void volume <b>fractions.</b> The active <b>portion</b> of these <b>fractions</b> stimulated FVa degradation by APC and supported the assembly of factor Xa and FVa into a functional prothrombinase complex. Both the procoagulant and anticoagulant activities were blocked by addition of annexin V, suggesting that the active portion was negatively charged phospholipid membranes. These results demonstrate that HDL does not stimulate the APC/protein S effect and that the activity previously reported to be a property of HDL is instead caused by contaminating negatively charged phospholipid membranes...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{management}} systems have greater effect on soil chemical, physical and biological properties. Conversion of forest to grassland and cultivated land can alter carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the changes in biological and physical carbon and nitrogen fractions after conversion of native forest to grassland and cultivated land in the northern Turkey. Some soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured. Soil texture ranged from sandy clay loam through clay loam. The highest bulk density was observed in the grassland (1. 41 g cm- 3) and the lowest one was in the cultivated land (1. 14 g cm- 3). Soil pH was the similar (pH = 7) in the three land uses. Microbial biomass C and total organic carbon were almost two times greater in the forest than forest cleared grassland and four times greater than cultivated land. The greater portion of organic carbon was stored in macro aggregates (> 250 micron) in the three land uses. Physically unprotected organic carbon (light <b>fraction)</b> comprises smaller <b>portion</b> of soil organic carbon in the three land uses. Therefore, this study indicated that microbial biomass C, mineralizable C, and protected organic C decrease in forest cleared grassland and cultivated lands...|$|R

This research has a goal to know the quality of paving block by using the mixing gravels and roof tile fraction on the most optimum level. Paving block is designed by mixing comparison volume; cement : sand : gravel: 1 : 3 : 2, 5 with water cement factor 0, 5. The volume of roof tile <b>fraction</b> to gravel <b>portion</b> is various from 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. The test with compression strength, worn out resistance, water absorb and resistance from natrium sulfat is on the age of 28 days paving block The {{research shows that the}} mixing variation of gravel and roof tile fraction 60 % resulted compression strength on optimum to 162, 20 kg/cm or there is an increase 57 % to the normal mixing (103, 3 kg/cm); worn out resistance 0, 33 mm/menit; water absorb 8, 62 %, loss weight cause of natrium sulfat 4, 55 %. The conclusion, the use of roof tile fraction as mixing material together with gravels for paving block in comparison applied has not fulfilled Sll 0819 - 83 quality lll.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} implied that GPIb-IX-V {{as well as}} {{functioning}} as an adhesion receptor may also induce signaling to mediate binding of platelets to damaged vessel wall to prevent bleeding. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton and redistribution of platelet structural proteins and signaling molecules {{are thought to be}} important in this early activation process, though the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully defined. In this study, we have used mucetin, a snake venom lectin protein that activates platelets via GPIb, to study the redistribution of GPIb in platelets. In unstimulated platelets, a minor portion of GPIb localized to Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton <b>fractions</b> (TIC). This <b>portion</b> increased considerably after platelet activation by mucetin. We also find increased contents of the FcRgamma chain in TIC. Anti-GPIb antibodies, mocarhagin or cytochalasin D completely inhibited the cytoskeletal translocation. In addition, BAPTA-AM, a cytoplasmic calcium chelator, strongly inhibited this process. On the other hand, inhibitors of alphaIIbbeta 3, PLCgamma, PKC, tyrosine kinases, ADP receptor, PI 3 -kinase or EDTA are effective in preventing GPIb relocation in convulxin- but not in mucetin-activated platelets. We propose that cytoskeletal translocation of GPIb is upstream of alphaIIbbeta 3 activation and cross-linking of GPIb is sufficient to induce this event in mucetin-activated platelets...|$|R
40|$|With intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Vital R) chloroplasts, the {{activity}} of the NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase after activation by light was 30 micromoles of malate formed per milligram of chlorophyll per hour; an identical rate of O 2 evolution was obtained upon oxaloacetate reduction by the intact plastids. However, when {{the activity}} of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase was measured subsequently to maximal activation of the enzyme by dithiothreitol (DTT) an average rate of 113 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour was obtained. When membranes and stroma were separated after osmotic disruption of the chloroplasts, 28 % of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase activity inducible by DTT was found with the membranes and 72 % was found in the stromal <b>fraction.</b> The membrane-associated <b>portion</b> of the enzyme corresponds well with the activity achieved after activation by light. About 64 % of an activator system was found to be associated also with the membrane fraction. Washing the membranes with buffer removed more activator than enzyme. However, both were removed almost completely by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. It was concluded that both a portion of the enzyme and the total activator system are associated with the chloroplast membranes in vivo and that the activator is more loosely bound than the enzyme. A model describing the partial activation of chloroplastic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase by light and the total activation by DTT is presented...|$|R
40|$|Size-selective {{atmospheric}} aerosol samples, collected between March 28 and April 8 2002 in Changdao, {{a small island}} in eastern China, were characterized by analysis of elements, ions, organic and elemental carbon, lead isotopes, and single particles. On the basis of compositional differences and remote sensing information, three distinct aerosol pollution episodes were identified. The first was dominated by fine particles with a substantial contribution from biomass burning emissions and industrial lead-containing particles from inland China at least 800 kilometers away. The second was characterized by coarse and aged secondary calcium sulfate particles and primary calcium sulfate particles from local industrial sources as well as windblown mineral dust. The third was a typical Asian Dust event with a source region {{on the border between}} China and Mongolia at a distance of around 1000 kilometers. Abundant sulfate particles found {{at the beginning of the}} Asian Dust event were predominantly ammonium sulfates in the fine fraction and calcium and ammonium sulfates in the coarse <b>fraction.</b> The major <b>portion</b> of the pollutants and the dust front of the event arrived in separate air masses. Although the three events occurred in quick succession they were quite different in terms of size distribution, chemical composition, sulfate speciation, source types, and source geographic locations. Biomass burning, industrial emission, coal combustion, and mineral dusts were identified as sources of the Asian continental outflow...|$|R
40|$|At {{the western}} {{continental}} {{margin of the}} Barents Sea, 75 °N, hemipelagic sediments provide a record of Holocene climate change with a time resolution of 10 – 70 years. Planktic foraminifera counts reveal a very early Holocene thermal optimum 10. 7 – 7. 7 kyr BP, with summer sea surface temperatures (SST) of 8 °C and a much enhanced West Spitsbergen Current. There was a short cooling between 8. 8 and 8. 2 kyr BP. In the middle and late Holocene summer, SST dropped to 2. 5 °- 5. 0 °C, indicative of reduced Atlantic heat advection, except for two short warmings near 2. 2 and 1. 6 kyr BP. Distinct quasi-periodic spikes of coarse sediment <b>fraction</b> (with large <b>portions</b> of lithic grains, benthic and planktic foraminifera) record cascades of cold, dense winter water down the continental slope {{as a result of}} enhanced seasonal sea ice formation and storminess on the Barents shelf over the entire Holocene. The spikes primarily cluster near recurrence intervals of 400 – 650 and 1000 – 1350 years, when traced over the entire Holocene, but follow significant 885 –/ 840 – and 505 –/ 605 -year periodicities in the early Holocene. These non-stationary periodicities mimic the Greenland- 10 Be variability, which is a tracer of solar forcing. Further significant Holocene periodicities of 230, (145) and 93 years come close to the deVries and Gleissberg solar cycles...|$|R
