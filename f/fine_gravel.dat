5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as <b>fine</b> <b>gravel</b> or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E

Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or <b>fine</b> <b>gravel</b> to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras panda inhabits clear river {{waters that}} are {{relatively}} fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or <b>fine</b> <b>gravel.</b> These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The {{proximity of the}} home rivers of the fish to the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led the fish to be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes—the temperature range of the fish is 16°C to 28°C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for limited periods, survive temperatures as low as 12°C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|Recorded {{items in}} the broad whitefish's diet are chironomid midges, {{mosquito}} larvae, snails, bivalves, and crustaceans. It migrates upstream to spawn, except in some estuaries. These migrations are difficult for it, and many individuals become heavily scarred from infestations, lampreys, and fishing nets. It prefers streams with gravel bottoms, especially those with <b>finer</b> <b>gravel,</b> for spawning. After hatching, larval fish move downstream. In Russia, spawning occurs between July and November in various populations.|$|R

50|$|The Environment Agency {{are hoping}} to achieve good overall status by 2027. The river channel is heavily modified, and this {{contributes}} to its biological status. The reservoirs at the upper end trap sediments, and prevent the recharge of gravel beds further downstream. Additionally, there are no major tributaries on the upper and middle section, to provide alternative sources of sediment. The controlling of the flow by releases from Damflask Reservoir and some high flow or spill events have further removed <b>finer</b> <b>gravels,</b> leaving larger rocks and boulders, which are not ideal for fish propagation. The remaining weirs have a detrimental effect both on the movement of gravel and the migration of fish and other species. Some sections of the river have also been protected by hard banking, and near Hillsborough, by channellisation.|$|R
500|$|Jack jumper ants live in open habitats, such as damp areas, forests, pastures, {{gardens and}} lawns, preferring <b>fine</b> <b>gravel</b> and sandy soil. Colonies {{can also be}} spotted around light bushland. Their {{preferred}} natural habitats include woodlands, dry open forests, grasslands and rural areas, and less common in urban areas. Their nests are mounds built from finely granular gravel, soil and pebbles, measuring [...] in diameter and can be as tall as half of a metre (20in) in height. Two types of nests for this species have been described: one being a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, the other being a complex structure surrounded by a mound. These ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat in a quick duration, providing the nest with solar energy traps. They decorate their nests with seeds, soil, charcoal, stones, sticks, and even small invertebrate corpses. They also camouflage their nests by covering leaf litter, debris and long grass over the nest. Nests can be found hidden under rocks, where queens will most likely form their colony, or around small piles of gravel instead. Their range in southern Australia, like other regional ant species, appears {{like that of a}} relict ant. Jack jumpers have been found in dry sclerophyll forests, at elevations ranging from , averaging [...] Rove beetles in the genus Heterothops generally thrive in jack jumper nests and raise their brood within their chambers, and skinks have been found in some nests.|$|E
500|$|Spawning {{sites are}} usually {{a bed of}} <b>fine</b> <b>gravel</b> in a riffle above a pool. A female trout clears a redd in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 [...] eggs per {{kilogram}} of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. [...] As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin. In approximately two weeks, the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and {{quality and quantity of}} food. As fry grow, they begin to develop [...] "parr" [...] marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called [...] "parr" [...] because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger. [...] In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or [...] "carryover" [...] for several seasons before they are caught or perish.|$|E

During the research it was founded that the oldest cultural layer, formed at the site, was from {{the time when the}} church was constructed. Lonely discovery of a Byzantine fibula, then discovery of bricks mostly of their fragments incorporated as spoils, embossed altar as a base of recent altars, does not indicate the existence of an ancient layer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} density {{inhomogeneity}} on the YORP effect {{for a given}} shape model is investigated. A density inhomogeneity will cause an offset between the center of figure {{and the center of}} mass and a reorientation of the principal axes away from those associated with the shape alone. Both of these effects can alter the predicted YORP rate of change in angular velocity and obliquity. We apply these corrections to the Itokawa shape model and find that its YORP angular velocity rate is sensitive to offsets between its center of mass and center of figure, with a shift on the order of 10 meters being able to change the sign of the YORP effect for that asteroid. Given the non-detection of YORP for Itokawa as of 2008, this can shed light on the density distribution within that body. The theory supports a shift of the asteroid center of mass towards Itokawa’s neck region, where there is an accumulation of <b>finer</b> <b>gravels.</b> Detection of the YORP effect for Itokawa should provide some strong constraints on its density distribution. This theory could also be applied to asteroids visited by future spacecraft to constrain density inhomogeneities. ...|$|R
