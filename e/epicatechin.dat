5|$|Apples are a {{rich source}} of various phytochemicals {{including}} flavonoids (e.g., catechins, flavanols, and quercetin) and other phenolic compounds (e.g., <b>epicatechin</b> and procyanidins) found in the skin, core, and pulp of the apple; they have unknown health value in humans.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of heart disease. In a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of <b>epicatechin</b> equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{polyphenols}} in chokeberries {{has identified}} the following individual chemicals (among hundreds known {{to exist in}} the plant kingdom): cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, quercetin-3-glycoside, <b>epicatechin,</b> caffeic acid, delphinidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin. All these except caffeic acid are members of the flavonoid category of phenolics.|$|E
40|$|Many {{thousand}} polyphenolics in {{the plant}} world contribute importantly to the human food supply. Probably the most abundant are the flavonoids, which comprise the isoflavones in soybean, the flavonol catechins and <b>epicatechins</b> in grapes and tea, quercetin in onions and apples, naringin in citrus, and oth-ers. The role of flavonoids as likely mediators of {{the health benefits of}} eating fruit and vegetables and the potential of flavonoids in promoting health as individual nutrients has stimulated substantial research as well as speculation. On occasion, epidemiologic associations and preliminary research have led to overly simplistic extrapolations; eg, the Japanese paradox is based on soy and green tea, the French paradox is based on red wine, and the benefits of the Mediterranean diet are based on olive oil.

25|$|In general, cocoa is {{considered}} to be a rich source of antioxidants such as procyanidins and flavanoids, which may impart antiaging properties. Cocoa also contain a high level of flavonoids, specifically <b>epicatechin,</b> which may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Cocoa is a stimulant and contains the compounds theobromine and caffeine. The beans contain between 0.1% and 0.7% caffeine, whereas dry coffee beans are about 1.2% caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Wet pile {{fermented}} pu'er has {{higher levels}} of caffeine and much {{higher levels of}} gallic acid compared with traditionally aged raw pu'er. Additionally, traditionally aged pu'er has higher levels of the antioxidant and carcinogen-trapping epigallocatechin gallate as well as (+)-catechin, (–)-epicatechin, (–)-epigallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, and <b>epicatechin</b> gallate than wet pile fermented pu'er. Finally, wet pile fermented puer has much lower total levels for all catechins than traditional pu'er and other teas except for black tea which also has low total catechins.|$|E
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, <b>epicatechin</b> and <b>epicatechin</b> gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, <b>epicatechin,</b> gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E
50|$|Catechins and <b>epicatechins</b> {{are found}} in cocoa, which, {{according}} to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). Açaí oil, obtained from {{the fruit of the}} açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg). (-)-Epicatechin and (+)-catechin are among the main natural phenols in argan oil.|$|R

50|$|Phytochemicals {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} research compounds rather than essential nutrients because proof of their possible health effects has not been established yet. Phytochemicals under research can be classified into major categories, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, which include phenolic acids, flavonoids, and stilbenes/lignans. Flavonoids can be further divided into groups based on their similar chemical structure, such as anthocyanins, flavones, flavanones, and isoflavones, and flavanols. Flavanols further are classified as catechins, <b>epicatechins,</b> and proanthocyanidins.|$|R
2500|$|The {{stimulant}} {{activity of}} cocoa {{comes from the}} compound theobromine which is less diuretic as compared to theophylline found in tea. Prolonged intake of flavanol-rich cocoa {{has been linked to}} cardiovascular health benefits, though this refers to raw cocoa and to a lesser extent, dark chocolate, since flavonoids degrade during cooking and alkalizing processes. Short-term benefits in LDL cholesterol levels from dark chocolate consumption have been found. The addition of whole milk to milk chocolate reduces the overall cocoa content per ounce while increasing saturated fat levels. [...] Although one study has concluded that milk impairs the absorption of polyphenolic flavonoids, e.g. <b>epicatechin,</b> a followup failed to find the effect.|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{green tea}} is 99.9% water, {{provides}} 1 Calorie per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table) and contains phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and caffeine. Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), <b>epicatechin</b> gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which have antioxidant, anticarcinogen, anti-inflammatory, and anti-radiation biochemical effects in vitro. [...] Other components include {{three kinds of}} flavonoids, known as kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. A remarkably higher content of myricetin is detected in tea and its extracts than in many other plants, and this high concentration of myricetin may have some implications for the experimentally-observed bioactivity of tea and its extracts in vitro.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, <b>epicatechin,</b> quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E

30|$|Polyphenolic compounds, {{which are}} widely {{distributed}} in plants, contribute to color (Tsuda et al. 2004) and flavor (Lea 1992) and {{are involved in}} pigment biosynthesis (Kurauchi et al. 2011), plant disease defense (Matern and Kneusel 1988) and damage caused by abiotic stress (Solovchenko and Schmitz-Eiberger 2003). Notably, polyphenols {{are responsible for the}} protective effects of plants against a variety of human diseases including cancer (Thomasset et al. 2007). Tea, which contains abundant polyphenols (Mukhtar and Ahmad 2000; Higdon and Frei 2003), {{is one of the most}} popular beverages in the world. Among the polyphenols, catechins are the major components, occupying more than 10  % of dry tea leaves (Wei et al. 2011). Catechins in tea can be separated into <b>epicatechins</b> (GTE) and GTE epimers. GTE include (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (−)-epicatechin (EC); while major GTE epimers include (−)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (−)-gallocatechin (GC) and (−)-catechin (C).

40|$|Tea, {{the major}} source of dietary flavonoids, {{particularly}} the <b>epicatechins,</b> signifies the second most frequently consumed beverage worldwide, which varies its status from a simple ancient cultural drink to a nutrient component, endowed possible beneficial neuro-pharmacological actions. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress, resulting in reactive oxygen species generation, plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases, supporting the implementation of radical scavengers and metal chelating agents, such as natural tea polyphenols, for therapy. Vast epidemiology data indicate a correlation between occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and green tea consumption. In particular, recent literature strengthens the perception that diverse molecular signaling pathways, participating in the neuroprotective activity of the major green tea polyphenol, (−) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), renders this natural compound as potential agent {{to reduce the risk of}} various neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|AIM: Procyanidins (Pcy) are {{oligomers}} of catechins and <b>epicatechins.</b> In {{order to}} get more insight into the apoptotic effects of Pcy, we aimed to compare the death signaling pathways triggered by Pcy in TRAIL-sensitive human colon cancer cells (SW 480) and in their derived TRAIL-resistant metastatic cells (SW 620). METHODS: Cell death, DR 4 /DR 5, Bcl- 2 /Bax proteins, mitochondrial membrane po-tential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analyzed by flow cytome-try. Bid and cytochrome c were studied by immunoblotting and ELISA. RESULTS: Pcy (80 µg/ml) combined with exogenous TRAIL (30 ng/ml) enhanced the apoptotic effects of TRAIL in SW 480 but also in SW 620 cells, indicating that Pcy sensitized SW 620 cells to TRAIL treatment. Pcy up-regulated the expression of death receptors DR 4 /DR 5 of TRAIL. Activation of caspase- 8 and- 3 was observed in both cell lines but caspase- 9 was activated only in SW 620 cells.

40|$|Catechin {{epimerization}} is {{an important}} factor affecting tea catechin compositions and thereby tea quality. However, a lack of tea germplasms with high non-epicatechins limits relative research. Here, a tea cultivar Y 510 with high non-epicatechins was firstly reported and used for catechin and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Results showed that the (-) -gallocatechin gallate and (+) -catechin (C) contents in Y 510 were at least 136 and 6 times higher than those in Fudingdabaicha and 0306 I, but the <b>epicatechins</b> (-) -epigallocatechin and (-) -epicatechin (EC) were significantly lower. Eleven unigenes potentially involved in catechin epimerization were identified by RNA-Seq analysis. Based on a combination of catechin and gene expression analysis, it was hypothesized that two anthocyanidin reductase genes (CsANR 1, CsANR 2) and an anthocyanidin synthase gene (CsANS) are the key genes affecting catechin epimerization in tea. Non-epicatechin formations were hypothesized to be mainly influenced by the expression ratio of CsANR 2 to CsANR 1 and the expression of CsANS. Overexpression of CsANS in an Arabidopsis mutant tds 4 - 2 led to a significant increase of EC accumulation in seeds, revealing CsANS is important for catechin epimerization.

40|$|Despite over 50 {{years of}} research, {{the field of}} sports {{nutrition}} continues to grow at a rapid rate. Whilst the traditional research focus was one that centred on strategies to maximise competition performance, emerging data {{in the last decade}} has demonstrated how both macronutrient and micronutrient availability can play a prominent role in regulating those cell signalling pathways that modulate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and resistance training. Nonetheless, in the context of exercise performance, it is clear that carbohydrate (but not fat) still remains king and that carefully chosen ergogenic aids (e. g. caffeine, creatine, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanine, nitrates) can all promote performance in the correct exercise setting. In relation to exercise training, however, it is now thought that strategic periods of reduced carbohydrate and elevated dietary protein intake may enhance training adaptations whereas high carbohydrate availability and antioxidant supplementation may actually attenuate training adaptation. Emerging evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a regulatory role in muscle regeneration and subsequent hypertrophy following damaging forms of exercise. Finally, novel compounds (albeit largely examined in rodent models) such as <b>epicatechins,</b> nicotinamide riboside, resveratrol, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, phosphatidic acid and ursolic acid may also promote or attenuate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and strength training.

40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} apple procyanidins (Pcy), oligomers of catechins and <b>epicatechins</b> on Fas receptor expression and function in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (SW 480) and in their derived metastatic cells (SW 620). Methods: Pcy were characterized by reverse-phase HPLC. Cell death, Fas proteins, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fas mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR in real time. Results: Pcy up-regulated {{the expression of the}} Fas receptor at the cell surface of both cell lines but activated Fas gene transcription only in SW 620 cells. In SW 480 cells, Pcy combined with Fas agonist CH- 11 enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis involving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation, which were abrogated by the antagonist antibody of Fas receptor, the anti-Fas ZB 4. On the contrary, in SW 620 cells, CH- 11 was not able to enhance Pcy-triggered apoptosis indicating that Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis was not activated in these cells despite an up-regulation of Fas receptor gene expression. However, it was observed in SW 620 cells that Pcy activated the Fas receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway after a specific blockage of TRAIL-death DR 4 /DR 5 receptors. Conclusions: The present data showed that Pcy were able to activate the Fas receptor apoptotic pathway in SW 480 cells and favored a cross-talk between TRAIL and Fas receptors in SW 620 cells because specific blocking of TRAIL death receptors favored activation of the Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. These important data may allow the emergence of new therapeutic protocols targeting death receptors against resistant metastatic cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Catechins and <b>epicatechins</b> are {{monomers}} of {{naturally occurring}} proanthocyanidins, {{which have been}} reported with free radical scavenging, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiallergic, and vasodilatory properties. Plant parts rich in proanthocyanidins {{have been used for}} years in treatment of various ano-rectal diseases. This study compares the efficacy of two herbal preparations, Daflon® 500 mg and Roidosanal®, in ameliorating the signs and symptoms associated with hemorrhoids. Objective: To evaluate the safety and to compare the efficacy of a herbal preparation, Roidosanal® versus Daflon® 500 mg, on signs and symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease. Materials and Methods: In this pilot, active controlled, open-labeled multicentre study, 73 patients with proctoscopy proven hemorrhoids (Grade I to III) were randomly assigned to receive either Roidosanal® (Gr R; n = 37) or Daflon® 500 mg (Gr D; n = 36), for 15 days, at three centers in India. Assessment of hemorrhoidal symptoms was carried out in all patients at different time points. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed for both primary and secondary endpoints. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Both products were found to be equally effective in improving the ano-rectal conditions in Grade I and Grade II hemorrhoids; however, Roidosanal® demonstrated better efficacy in patients with Grade III hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids associated symptoms like bleeding, pain, etc., improved in both groups, although intergroup comparisons were comparable. Conclusion: Both Roidosanal® and Daflon® 500 mg were equally effective in resolving signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids.
