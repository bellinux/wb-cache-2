40|$|This {{article focuses}} on matters related to {{globalization}} and diversity management. One of the managerial challenges of trading in a globalized marketplace {{is the need to}} service an increasingly sophisticated, differentiated and competitive market. It is told that customers have become more educated, affluent and discerning in their choices. This has led, in turn, to demands that companies tailor their products and services more closely to customer needs and tastes. Since globalization has opened up competition across all sectors of an economy, no enterprise, whether large or small, appears to be exempt from such pressures. This is true whether companies trade domestically or internationally. Customization and niche marketing rely heavily on an intimate understanding of customer needs and the marshalling of a range of 'soft' people skills such as cultural knowledge, empathy and interpersonal communication. Managers are increasingly exhorted to identify and nurture such skills among employees and develop their own people management skills. Cross-cultural communication and <b>diversity</b> <b>skills</b> {{are an important part of}} this skill set...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{a diverse}} {{workforce}} {{is a business}} imperative yet challenges exist. Organizational members might neither recognize the impact they have on others nor how to build their toolkit of inter-cultural competence. If the organizational goal of embedding an inclusive environment {{is at odds with}} the values, behaviors, and attitudes of its employees, then inclusion will not be fully achieved and organizational performance will be impacted. While it is imperative to understand diverse attitudes, the next step in organizational diversity competence is identification of skills gaps and remediation. To accomplish these organizational outcomes we propose the further development and validation of an instrument, the Inclusion Skills Measurement Profile (ISM) The instrument will provide organizations with the information necessary to move diversity to the next level. The instrument will identify <b>diversity</b> <b>skills</b> gaps, thus enabling individual, teams and organizations to enhance their competence in this area. The instrument will provide feedback in seven areas: diversity sensitivity, integrity with difference, interacting with difference, valuing difference, team inclusion, managing conflict over difference, and embedding inclusion. The seven categories are based on experience of experts, and grounded firmly in relevant theory. Additionally, the article will present implications for practice and suggestions for future research...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} two columns, we examine the {{relationship}} between specialized and general skills and earnings by occupation. Column (4) focuses on the earnings of persistent laborers and column (5) examines the earnings of persistent entrepreneurs, respectively, and test whether entrepreneurs benefit from <b>skill</b> <b>diversity</b> more than specialists. As shown in {{the last two}} columns, individual entrepreneurs obtain a significant positive return to academic <b>skill</b> <b>diversity</b> (AC_SPEC), while persistent laborers do not. This confirms that individuals become entrepreneurs because their <b>skill</b> <b>diversity</b> generates higher entrepreneurial productivity, not because individuals have taste in variety, in which case we expect a negative return on <b>skill</b> <b>diversity.</b> Furthermore, experience in more industries is negatively related to laborer’s income but positively related to entrepreneur’s income. It confirms that entrepreneurs earn more from having more diverse work experience, but laborers maximize income from specialization. Therefore, we complete the test of hypotheses from the dynamic occupation choices model. And we confirm that higher level of unobserved entrepreneurial abilities induces individuals to consistently invest in human capital diversely and benefit from this diversity. Switching occupations due to exogenous shock will lower income because of sunk human capital that is not reversible.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Verbal {{communication}} impairments {{are prominent}} features of schizophrenia. The grammatical and pragmatic components of expressive and receptive verbal abilities were systematically examined, {{for the first}} time, in Italian patients with schizophrenia. Indeed, most of the language literature is composed of studies on English speaking people. Method: Elicited narrative production, and syntactic and pragmatic receptive abilities were analyzed in a cohort of 37 patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy controls. Furthermore, a conversational speech production task was administered to an age- and gender- matched subset of this population. The level of significance was set at p à 0. 01. Results: Participants with schizophrenia produced significantly less words on the narrative task and were less fluent on the conversational task than healthy controls. In both narrative and conversational speech they showed significantly poorer syntactic <b>diversity</b> <b>skills.</b> Errors at word level did not distinguish the two groups. At a receptive level, syntactic abilities were selectively impaired in patients with schizophrenia, who were also slower than controls in providing their answers. Metaphor and idiom explanations revealed consistent deficits in patients with respect to controls. Conclusions: Reduced syntactic diversity characterized expressive language skills in schizophrenia. Syntactic abilities were selectively impaired also at the receptive level, suggesting an underlying processing deficit. On the pragmatic test schizophrenia patients were significantly less able to produce appropriate interpretations, indicating the presence of abnormal pragmatic inferential abilities. These findings confirm that language impairment is a key feature of schizophrenia independent of mother language and suggest a possible deficit involving hemispheric lateralization processes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – One of {{the most}} {{important}} considerations in any research project is a compelling research question, the addressing of which will produce socially and/or economically relevant and beneficial insights based on high-quality evidence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explain that each possible research question requires use of the particular research methods that will produce the high-quality evidence relevant to that question, with the nature of the evidence and the methods required varying from research question to research question. Design/methodology/approach – This discussion paper explores and explains the role and function of interpretive accounting research advocates its adoption. Findings – As the research method needs to be suited to the research question, any restriction imposed on the credible research methods that are considered acceptable severely limits the ability of the accounting academy to serve the needs of society and the economy by addressing the broadest possible range of research questions. From this perspective it is vital for academics to recognize that both positivist/quantitative and interpretive/qualitative methods produce high-quality credible research evidence. Research limitations/implications – Any preconceptions within a nation's accounting academy over the unacceptability of either positivist or interpretive research will damage the health and relevance of that academy in the longer term. Originality/value – The paper argues that both positivist and interpretivist research are needed, drawing on notions of subjectivity, objectivity and inter-subjectivity in the context of the social construction of both accounting information and research data, and in the context of the socially constructing nature of research evidence.

Respondents included 41 sixth graders, 24 parents, 2 teachers, and 2 principals from 2 elementary schools. ^ The research data answered four questions: (1) To what extent do the attitudes and beliefs held by adolescents reflect multiculturalism? (2) Can multiculturalism {{be a factor in}} influencing interracial sociability and in encouraging adolescent cross-race friendship choices? (3) To what extent do the attitudes and beliefs held by parents, teachers, and administrators reflect multiculturalism? (4) Can a multicultural viewpoint help manage diversity in a school setting complicated by racism?^ The results of the study showed adolescents, parents, teachers, and administrators believing that an evolution of critical understanding about multiculturalism and diversity will lead to positive race relations among racial and ethnic groups. For instance, {{the results of the study}} showed that while both sixth grade classes value differences they strongly believe that they learn a lot from friends of different ethnic, racial, and class backgrounds. Further, the results of the study showed that these adolescents believe that an understanding about diversity will lead to interracial sociability and in encouraging cross-race friendship choices. ^ All parents, teachers, and administrators believe that multiculturalism enhances adolescents 2 ̆ 7 <b>diversity</b> <b>skills</b> in a profoundly positive way.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Human Resource Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 South Africa is a country, {{which is}} rich in history and has a young democracy, which {{continues}} to evolve. The new democratic Government has envisioned a Higher Education (HE) system that would be accessible to all who wants to further their tertiary studies. The White Paper on the Transformation of Higher Education of 1997 reaffirms the purpose of HE with regard to social responsibility, since it incorporates community engagement as a scholarly activity, which places emphasis on developing students as future citizens of South Africa. HE can produce different forms of community engagement, which include but {{is not limited to}} distance education, community based research, participatory action research, professional community service and service learning. The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) accepts that South Africa has social and economic challenges, as any young democracy has, and incorporates Service Learning as a mechanism, which may contribute to the solutions of such challenges. In this research study, emphasis is placed on Service Learning as a teaching methodology to enhance students’ interpersonal and <b>diversity</b> <b>skills,</b> while it also develops their professional learning experience, as well as their corporate social responsibility.

Traditionally {{leadership}} {{is associated with}} cognitive skills such as critical thinking and effective decision-making. Recently, research has determined the even greater importance of emotional intelligence (EQ) in business leadership generally, and specifically in diversity management. This applies equally to industry. Psychometric assessments of sixty middle managers at Assmang Manganese, a large ferromanganese producer in KZN, revealed a major deficiency in <b>diversity</b> management <b>skills,</b> linked to low levels of EQ. In an empirical study, ten of these managers were re-assessed, using a multi-rating system, with regard to five specific categories of EQ considered most relevant to diversity management. The conclusions drawn from this study indicate: • significant discrepancies between the self-perception of the ten managers and the perceptions of their senior manager and subordinates • discrepancies between the scores obtained in this assessment {{and those of the}} earlier psychometric tests • that eight of the ten managers displayed low levels of diversity management, especially with regard to tolerance and empathy, and • that an urgent need exists for training and development in emotional intelligence as a means of enhancing the <b>diversity</b> management <b>skills</b> of middle managers at Assmang Manganese.

40|$|Project work, group work, and {{teamwork}} are recognised as being {{central to the}} field of Information Systems practice. Academic institutions, in response, recognise the importance of ensuring students are exposed to this environment during their studies. Guided practice and exposure to teamwork has mainstream acceptance, as is evidenced by its inclusion within `IS 97 (used extensively in local curriculum design). The particular impact of the dimensions of personality and cultural background on team effectiveness has been identified within industry and tertiary educational institutions. Unfortunately, in contrast to industry, where teams normally contain a <b>diversity</b> of <b>skills,</b> academic study teams tend towards homogeneous skillbases {{due to the nature of}} university degree programmes.
