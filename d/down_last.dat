25|$|After a late-season {{implosion}} in 2009, {{head coach}} Mike Thibault {{had to make}} some crucial decisions for a team whose culture completely broke <b>down</b> <b>last</b> year. Connecticut started its rebuilding process quickly, acquiring DeMya Walker in the Monarchs' dispersal draft. The Sun then snagged the first overall pick in the 2010 collegiate draft in a trade with the Minnesota Lynx; a trade that would have the Sun's most recognizable face in starting point guard Lindsay Whalen, along with the second overall pick, shipped to Minneapolis. This package netted the Sun Montgomery, who {{would prove to be}} luxury in the deal. Thibault continued to reshape his roster after introducing Kara Lawson at a press conference as a new member of the Sun. Lawson was formerly a member of the Monarchs' team that decimated the Sun's chances of a WNBA title. Lawson, along with Montgomery, formed a backcourt that would be able to dictate pace and bolster the Sun's perimeter arsenal attack. The Sun also signed reserves Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota and Tan White to multiyear contracts to solidify the Sun's revamped backcourt.|$|E
500|$|The Sex Pistols {{film was}} {{completed}} by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of [...] "My Way") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a [...] "very stylised...polemic". They were reacting {{to the fact that}} the Pistols had become the [...] "poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel <b>down</b> <b>last</b> thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans". In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of [...] "lessons" [...] to be learned from [...] "an invention of mine they called the punk rock".|$|E
500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it <b>down</b> <b>last</b> spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E
