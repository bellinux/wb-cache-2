500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams.

Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1986, Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: [...] "I wasn't making any money. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> we were gonna {{be doing this}} professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] for the film Less Than Zero. Although the band was {{not happy with the}} final product, Hanneman deeming it [...] "a poor representation of Slayer" [...] and King labeling it [...] "a hunk of shit," [...] it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.|$|E

5000|$|Cancer is rot {{of tissue}} {{in a living}} organism. In junk {{sickness}} the junk dependent cells die and are replaced. Cancer is a premature death process. The cancer patient shrinks. A junkie shrinks—I have lost up to fifteen pounds in three days. So <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>if</b> the accumulator is a therapy for cancer, it should be therapy for the after-effects of junk sickness.|$|R
2500|$|... about {{claiming}} the passionate aspect of womanhood {{that the church}} teaches is wrong, [...] "the idea of speaking my truth, no censorship, {{in a place that}} did not honor anyone's truth unless it was the church's truth," [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> I was going to claim my womanhood, my passion, and sing this record - which, for me, was claiming fragments that I had suppressed for a long time - then I was {{going to go back to}} a church, back to the old world, to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the dial}} you could crank {{it up to}} 140 volts or down to zero. So <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> <b>if</b> it’s on 220 and it’s that quiet, if I take the voltage and lower it, I wonder how low I can go and it still work. Well, it enabled me to turn my amp all the way up, save the tubes, save {{the wear and tear}} on the tubes, and play at clubs at half the volume. So, my Variac, my {{variable}} transformer was my volume knob. Too loud, [...] I’d lower it down to 50.|$|E
5000|$|By 1994, Chris Rock's {{career had}} {{experienced}} a downslide: [...] "I was a has-been.

6000|$|... "Anyway," [...] Lewson went on, [...] "we killed seals all {{the open}} season with that Russian, and I've no fault to find with him. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>if</b> {{he could have}} fixed it he'd have left us on the island that winter, but when a {{schooner}} came to take the killers off and collect the skins Smirnoff was on board of her. That"--and an ominous gleam crept into Lewson's eyes--"was the real beginning of the trouble." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} for the 2D/3D {{aesthetic}} really just started with the Trixel idea. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that <b>if</b> we built our entire game world from these little cubes, all perfectly aligned on a 3D grid, we'd get this [...] "3D Pixel" [...] look.

5000|$|Rex Garrett - We had the 1990 reunion {{under our}} belt. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> we could {{pull it off}} live we can damn sure {{do it in the}} studio!

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} created during Schultz and Fraites' time in New York as a kiss-off to disinterested concert-goers. [...] "That song {{was an effort}} to get under people's skin at shows in Brooklyn, where everyone is pretty indifferent," [...] Schultz told American Songwriter. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> we could punctuate it with shouts we might get someone's attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, {{the tabloid}} {{television}} show Hard Copy broadcast a secretly videotaped conversation between Fisher and Paul Makely, {{the owner of}} a gym in Massapequa. In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to get married to Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional, and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: [...] "That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why?

2500|$|... "Let me {{tell you}} the story of 'Please Please Me'. The record was {{released}} on the Vee-Jay label. It was a local Chicago recording company. The owner, Ewart Abner, brought a copy of the record to WLS. I was the music director at the time and listened to his story about a group, and looked at pictures in teen magazines he brought back from England. <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> what <b>if</b> this group would get as popular in the United States as they were in England and Europe. So I added the record to the list." ...|$|R
5000|$|Okoye {{enrolled}} in fall 2009 at VMI {{to play for}} the Keydets. He had initial struggles coping with college life, especially at a military school where upperclassmen put mental and physical pressures on freshmen. At one point he contemplated dropping out before having played in a single college basketball game, but Okoye stuck with it because of support from his teammates. He said, [...] "I stuck it out because of the other guys. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> they could take it, I could too." ...|$|E

5000|$|Wild started Retronaut in January 2010, sharing daily archival {{images that}} show [...] "the past like you wouldn't believe". As Wild has described, {{during his time}} working in museums and archives: [...] "there were some objects and {{pictures}} I saw that for me had an enormous and seemingly untapped power - a power to disrupt our sense of time, to dissolve the barrier between present and past. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could harness that power, I {{might be able to}} build something akin to a time-machine.

The 1980 US Hockey Team, which won the gold medal at the 1980 games, was given the honor instead. Said Heiden [...] "I was probably just too stubborn. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> they don’t appreciate what I did as a skater, if they don’t appreciate now what I am doing as a human being, I’d just as soon hang out with my buddies and watch it.

However, the updated version doesn't even meet the lowest of expectations and blows past mediocre to land at downright terrible. The film is slow and dull, the lead actors have absolutely no chemistry, and the musical aspect doesn't add anything to the film." ...|$|R

It was initially a cassette only release and it took all the money I had. Later, a short run was made on LP in Canada and then it went out of print. So here it is again, first time on CD. It's just awful. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>if</b> I put it in for free you couldn't get too mad about how wretched it is. As for Big Ugly Mouth, we sent it to engineer supreme Phil Klum to even out the levels of the tracks and clear it up some so it should sound better this time around. Enjoy...or something.|$|E
