30|$|Carcinogenesis {{and energy}} {{metabolism}} {{can be both}} influenced by the environment. Growing evidence has demonstrated that several environmental factors, including physical, chemical, and biological environmental factors, can <b>disturb</b> cellular <b>energy</b> metabolism. When energy metabolic dysfunction occurs, the living cell microenvironment and surroundings encounter alterations, which may become conducive to cancer cell proliferation. Leading alterations include acidity [6] and interstitial fluid pressure [7] in the microenvironment, such alterations can promote risks of carcinogenesis. Besides this, hypoxic microenvironment is tightly correlated with cancer progression as well [8]. Therefore, environmental pollution factors can <b>disturb</b> <b>energy</b> homeostasis by triggering microenvironment alteration, thereby increasing carcinogenic risks.|$|R

Based on {{the field}} theory in physics {{and in order to}} improve the {{effectiveness}} of ideological and political education, this paper analyzes the <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> of ideological and political education. <b>Energy</b> <b>field</b> of ideological and political education belongs to the education field. It overlaps moral field and cultural field in some aspects and differs from them in other aspects. Composed of <b>energy</b> source, <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> force and <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> factors, <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> have three function mechanisms: psychology and emotion; information and culture; environment and institution. It could be divided into positive and negative energy. The creation of ideological and political education <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> could get the thinking way of “subject and object dichotomy ” in present ideological and political education research out of dilemma, broaden the study horizon and innovate education methods...|$|R

Brennan claims to receive intuitive information about her clients during sessions, and to see repetitive patterns in the <b>energy</b> <b>fields</b> of her clients indicating common roots underlying their difficulties. Brennan's books contain drawings of auras and <b>energy</b> <b>fields,</b> and descriptions of how human <b>energy</b> <b>fields</b> interact with each other. She has popularized a seven-layer model of the <b>energy</b> <b>field,</b> each layer being structured of differing frequencies and kinds of energy and performing different functions. Brennan views the chakras as transformers that receive and process universal energy, as well as enabling expression and healthy functioning of the individual's own consciousness and psycho-physical make-up. She is best known for taking a methodical approach to energy healing.|$|R

25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified <b>energy</b> <b>fields.</b> Taking light as an example, receptors in our eyes turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in our eye is triggered our brain <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> merges with the <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events at the source and at the receiver are happening at the same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement at the source. It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|R

30|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} the fire <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> as a way to characterize the radiant, conductive, and convective energy flows produced by a wildland fire.

It is impractical to measure the field at all points in space and not yet practical to implement a 3 -dimensional time-resolved transport model (Mell et al. 2009). Lacking these details, we must resort to simplifications or analogs that are physically relevant and also measurable.|$|R

30|$|Measurements using {{temperature}} {{measuring devices}} such as thermocouple probes {{can be used to}} estimate fireline intensity and related parameters, like fuel consumption, if careful calibration is performed by comparison with field measurements (Bova and Dickinson 2008). Derivation of heat flux through physical modeling of both the thermocouple and the <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> in which the thermocouple is immersed has also shown promise (Bova and Dickinson 2008). The problem here is to infer the <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> from the fire using only the heating of the thermocouple probe. Because of the availability and simplicity of the measuring apparatus, this measurement and modeling scheme may be useful as a way to measure the <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> at many points within the fire.|$|R

40|$|Between 1983 and 1989, {{employment}} of nuclear engineers {{in the nuclear}} <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> increased almost 40 percent while the annual number of nuclear engineering degrees awarded decreased by almost one-fourth. There were, on average, more job openings for new graduates than there were new graduates available to fill the jobs during the 1980 s. This trend reversed in the l 990 s as nuclear engineering employment in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> decreased from 11, 500 in 1991 to 9, 400 in 1995. During roughly the same period, the annual number of nuclear engineering degrees increased by 11 percent. As a result, from 1990 through 1995, {{the number of new}} graduate nuclear engineers available in the labor supply far exceeded the number of job openings for new graduates in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field.</b> This oversupply of new graduates was particularly acute for 1993 through 1995. During 1996 [...] 1997, a relative improvement is expected in job opportunities in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> for new graduates; however, a large oversupply is still expected (almost twice as many graduates available for employment as there are job openings). For 1998 through 2000, some improvement is expected in the relative number of job opportunities for new graduates in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field.</b> Nuclear engineering jobs in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field</b> are expected to decrease only slightly (by less than 150) during this period. Also a 10 [...] 15 % decrease in the annual number of degrees and available supply of new graduates is expected. Overall, an oversupply is expected (140 graduates available per 100 job openings for new graduates in the nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>field),</b> but this is still a substantial improvement over the current period. For 2001 through 2005, if enrollments and degrees continue to decline, the labor market for new graduates is expected to be approximately balanced. This assumes, however, that the number of degrees and the available supply of new graduates will decrease by 25 % from 1995 levels...|$|R
50|$|In {{communication}} systems, {{noise is}} an error or undesired random disturbance of a useful information signal. The noise is a summation of unwanted or <b>disturbing</b> <b>energy</b> from natural and sometimes man-made sources. Noise is, however, typically distinguished from interference, {{for example in}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) measures. Noise is also typically distinguished from distortion, which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).|$|R
