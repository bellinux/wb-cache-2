40|$|The {{overtopping}} empirical formulas {{calculate the}} discharge {{only at the}} top of the crest of a coastal protection structure. On the other hand, the tolerable overtopping discharges are defined at certain points behind the crest where the total overtopping is reduced. The scope of this thesis is to find an empirical formula to describe the distribution of overtopping at the space behind the crest. This thesis comes as a further investigation on the work conducted by v. Kester [2009] for regular waves. In this research, a physical model was developed on which irregular waves are tested. Because of the duration of the tests and the amount of collected water (significant lose of water during the test), a completely new measuring system was designed. Five influencing parameters (variables) are considered on this research: wave height, wave period/steepness, slope angle, crest freeboard and crest permeability. The entire overtopping process is analysed separately for the total overtopping discharge, the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest and the distribution of overtopping behind the structure. In the analysis of the data collected from the measurements, the impact of the varying parameters is investigated leading to useful conclusions and better understanding of the entire process. Additionally, the experimental findings are analysed and compared to the relative existing methods. Based on the TAW [2002] method which is proposed by the EurOtop Manual [2007], a prediction formula is developed. This formula is a generic version of TAW [2002] formula in which a new reduction factor ?c is introduced in order to describe the decay of the overtopping and thus predict the discharge at any certain distance behind the crest. Other relevant methods are also analysed (Juul Jensen [1984], Steenaard [2002], Besley [1999] and v. Kester [2009]) and conclusions for their applicability are drawn leading to suggested improvements or corrections. Apart from the distribution of overtopping, on this thesis the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> crest <b>freeboard</b> (which is an ambiguous issue) is also investigated. Finally, suggestions of further research on this topic are discussed. The entire work has been perfomed in close cooperation with van Oord.

40|$|Based on {{variation}} {{characters of}} sea surface height and parameters of ICESat return pulse waveform, a method is proposed for estimating Arctic sea ice freeboard with ICESat observation.

40|$|Satellite {{platforms}} utilize altimeters {{to estimate}} the elevation <b>of</b> sea ice (<b>freeboard)</b> above the ocean surface, which can be converted into ice thickness. This work analyzes the characteristics and accuracy of these measurements. As a reference, ice thickness can be measured with helicopter-based electromagnetic induction sounding directly. This method assumes, that sea ice {{can be described as}} a level plate. Case studies of different types of ice deformations, using a 3 D EM forward model, show a local underestimation of true thickness between 40 and 80 %, but only a neglible error of mean ice thickness, when using this 1 D approach. The comparisons of radar and laser freeboard data show varying penetration depths of radar waves into the snow layer of arctic sea ice. A parametric snow depth is used for the freeboard to thickness conversion, where the difference of laser and radar altimeter did not yield the thickness of the snow layer. The error of mean ice thickness is generally lower than 20 % compared to results of the induction method. Spatial averaging <b>of</b> <b>freeboard</b> values at different scales resulted in an insignificant change <b>of</b> the <b>freeboard</b> to ice thickness ratio...|$|R
40|$|Ocean and sea ice models {{require a}} {{specification}} of the drag coefficients, which relate the turbulent fluxes {{of heat and}} momentum to atmospheric wind and temperature. Thedrag coefficients of sea ice depend {{on the structure of}} the surface and on atmospheric conditions. Observational programs with aircraft and boundary layer modeling work havebeen performed to obtain new parameterizations of the drag coefficients for wide ranges of sea ice conditions and atmospheric stabilities. The geometric surface roughness and the size distribution of sea ice floes have been investigated by airborne laser altimetry and camera surveys in the marginal ice zone ofthe Greenland sea. Downward looking scanning cameras in the visible and thermal infrared and a laser altimeter have been used. The 50 flight legs at a height of 30 m coveredan area of about 90 km 2. The total length of the flight track has been 1500 km. The measurements have been analysed to derive the heights <b>of</b> <b>freeboards</b> and pressure ridgesas well as the floe sizes and ridge spacings. Freeboard heights range from 0. 2 m close to the ice edge up to 0. 6 m deep in the pack-ice, where multiyear ice floes prevail. Themean ridge height of 0. 8 m is independent of the location in the marginal ice zone. Frequency distributions of ice ridge heights and separations are in good agreement withprevious results from the Arctic and Antarctic. Statistics of the sea-ice surface geometry have been used to evaluate the aerodynamic roughness of the pack-ice which is acombination of form and skin drag. Direct measurements of the turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat have been simultaneously performed and allow a direct <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the aerodynamicroughness. Both experimental and model results clearly reveal a dependency of the drag coefficient on the geometric surface roughness of sea-ice. The stability correcteddrag coefficient at a height of 10 m increases from 1. 1. 10 - 3 to 2. 4. 10 - 3 as the product h. r <b>of</b> <b>freeboard</b> height h and mean floe radius r increases from 0 to 0. 03.
