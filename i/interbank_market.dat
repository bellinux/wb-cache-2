5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the <b>interbank</b> <b>market,</b> their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
25|$|MMT economists {{regard the}} concept of the money multiplier, where a bank is {{completely}} constrained in lending through the deposits it holds and its capital requirement, as misleading. Rather than being a practical limitation on lending, the cost of borrowing funds from the <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> (or the central bank) represents a profitability consideration when the private bank lends in excess of its reserve and/or capital requirements (see interaction between government and the banking sector).|$|E
25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the <b>interbank</b> <b>market,</b> and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to study how <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> affect real economic activities, and to find the monetary policy implications. The model shows that, in a stationary equilibrium, the economy with <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> attains higher capital stock than the economy without the markets, because of precautionary money savings. In addition, I find that inflationary policy is more desirable in the economy without well-functioning <b>interbank</b> <b>markets.</b> overlapping generations, random relocation, inflation, <b>interbank</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

In {{the presence of}} regional or sectoral asset and liquidity shocks, <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> can distribute liquidity efficiently, but fail to respond efficiently to asset shocks. Broad banks can condition on the joint distribution of both shocks and, hence, achieve an efficient internal allocation of capital. This allocation involves the cross-subsidization of loans across regions or sectors. Compared to regional banks that are linked through well-functioning <b>interbank</b> <b>markets,</b> broad banks lead {{to higher levels of}} aggregate investment, higher output, and less fluctuations within regions. However, broad banks generate endogenously aggregate uncertainty. <b>Interbank</b> <b>markets</b> Broad banks Endogenous uncertainty Banking restrictions...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike a stock market, {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market is divided into levels of access. At the top is the interbank {{foreign exchange market}}, which {{is made up of}} the largest commercial banks and securities dealers. Within the <b>interbank</b> <b>market,</b> spreads, which are the difference between the bid and ask prices, are razor sharp and not known to players outside the inner circle. The difference between the bid and ask prices widens (for example from 0 to 1 pip to 1–2 pips for currencies such as the EUR) as you go down the levels of access. This is due to volume. If a trader can guarantee large numbers of transactions for large amounts, they can demand a smaller difference between the bid and ask price, which is referred to as a better spread. The levels of access that make up the foreign exchange market are determined {{by the size of the}} [...] "line" [...] (the amount of money with which they are trading). The top-tier <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> accounts for 51% of all transactions. From there, smaller banks, followed by large multi-national corporations (which need to hedge risk and pay employees in different countries), large hedge funds, and even some of the retail market makers. According to Galati and Melvin, “Pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and other institutional investors have played an increasingly important role in financial markets in general, and in FX markets in particular, since the early 2000s.” (2004) In addition, he notes, “Hedge funds have grown markedly over the 2001–2004 period in terms of both number and overall size”. Central banks also participate in the foreign exchange market to align currencies to their economic needs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monetary {{model in which}} <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> bear limited commitment to contracts.

I show that the constrained-efficient allocation can be decentralized by controlling only the money growth rate if commitment to interbank contracts is not limited. Otherwise, a proper combination of central bank loans and monetary policy is needed to bring the market equilibrium into a state of constrained efficiency.

50|$|Allen and Gale {{introduced}} an <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> into the Diamond-Dybvig model to study contagion of bank panics from one region to another. An <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> {{is created by}} banks because it insures them against a lack of liquidity at certain banks {{as long as the}} overall amount of liquidity is sufficient. Liquidity is allocated by the <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> so that banks that have excess liquidity can provide this to banks that lack liquidity. As long as the total demand for liquidity does not exceed the supply, the <b>interbank</b> <b>market</b> will allocate liquidity efficiently and banks will be better off. However, if demand exceeds supply, it can have disastrous consequences. The interregional cross-holdings of deposits cannot increase the total amount of liquidity. Thus, long-term assets have to be liquidated, which causes loss.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{tension in}} the <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> {{following}} the global financial crisis has raised concerns about the turbulence in <b>interbank</b> <b>markets.</b> This paper utilises two widely used indicators for measuring interbank stress (the interbank rate less the Overnight Index Swap rate and the interbank rate less the yield of government securities) to examine the transmission of interbank tension from the US dollar to nine <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> in the EMEAP economies. Using a vector autoregression model, we show that during the credit crisis of 2007 - 2008, the distress in the US dollar money market had a material impact with durations of seven to 13 days on the <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> for the Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar. Moreover, based on a bivariate regime switching ARCH model, we also find evidence of volatility co-movement between the interbank stress indicator of the US dollar {{and that of the}} Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Korean won and Singapore dollar during the crisis. The expected duration when two money markets are both in a high-volatility state is estimated to be as long as seven days.

In this paper we investigate which influence central bank activity has on <b>interbank</b> <b>markets.</b> In our model, banks optimize a portfolio of risky investments and riskless excess reserves according to their risk and liquidity preferences. They are linked via interbank loans and face a stochastic supply of household deposits. We then introduce a central bank into the model and show that central bank activity enhances financial stability. We model the default of a large bank and analyse the resulting contagion effects. This is compared to a common shock that hits banks who have invested in similiar assets. Our results indicate that common shocks are not subordinate to contagion effects, but are instead the greater threat to systemic stability. systemic risk, <b>interbank</b> <b>markets,</b> monetary policy, contagion, common shocks...|$|R

40|$|How do market-based {{channels}} for {{the provision of}} liquidity affect financial liberalization and contagion? In order to answer this question, I extend the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model of financial intermediation to a two-country environment with unobservable markets for borrowing and lending and comparative advantages in the investment technologies. I demonstrate that the role of hidden markets crucially depends on the level of financial integration of the economy. Despite always imposing a burden on intermediaries, unobservable markets allow agents to partially enjoy gains from financial integration when <b>interbank</b> <b>markets</b> are autarkic. In fully liberalized systems such effect instead disappears. Similarly, in autarky the distortion created by hidden markets improve the resilience of the system to unexpected liquidity shocks. With fully integrated <b>interbank</b> <b>markets,</b> such effect again disappears, as unexpected liquidity shocks always lead to bankruptcy and contagion. ...|$|R
