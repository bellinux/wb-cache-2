The quantitative interpretation of thermal desorption spectra was developed with the goal to obtain information on the interactions in adsorption layers. Work function measurements were developed and used for {{the determination of the}} thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional systems with attractive lateral interactions. For the study of two-dimensional systems with repulsive or oscillatory interactions, his group developed LEED-diffractometry that allows the determination of critical exponents in chemisorbed layers with accuracy comparable to that achieved with x-rays in physisorbed layers. He developed <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption (ESD) and static SIMS for the study of adsorbed layers and ultrathin films on single crystal surfaces; alkali ion scattering (ISS) for structural analysis of surfaces; field ion microscopy (FIM) of single atoms and clusters; UHV-SEM studies of surface melting.|$|E
40|$|The {{modifications}} to technological copper and niobium surfaces induced by 2. 5 keV electron irradiation {{have been investigated}} {{in the context of}} the conditioning process occurring in particle accelerator ultra high vacuum systems. Changes in the elemental surface composition have been found using Scanning Auger Microscopy (SAM) by monitoring the carbon, oxygen and metal Auger peak intensities as a function of electron irradiation in the dose range 10 - 6 to 10 - 2 C mm- 2. The surface analysis results are compared with electron dose dependent secondary electron and <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption yield measurements. Initially the electron irradiation causes a surface cleaning through <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption, in particular of hydrogen. During this period both the <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption and secondary electron yield decrease as a function of electron dose. When the electron dose exceeds 10 - 4 C mm- 2 <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption yields are reduced by several orders of magnitude and the electron beam induced growth of a carbon layer becomes the dominant process. Simultaneously the secondary electron yield is further reduced to values which are below those of an atomically clean metal surface...|$|E

40|$|Electron cloud {{parameters}} and vacuum design are tightly bounded to each other. Input parameters for the e-cloud {{depend on the}} shape of the vacuum chamber and surface properties. Beam induced electron multipacting in the vacuum chamber causes the <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> gas desorption and may require modification of the vacuum system to deal with it. This paper describes the e-cloud modelling performed in a way to optimise ILC positron DR vacuum design and to have a clear understanding of what modifications in the vacuum chamber are required. Three parameters of e-cloud were varied in turn: photo-electron emission, secondary electron yield and gas pressure. It was found that all three parameters should not exceed a certain value to keep the e-cloud density down to an acceptable level. The energy and intensity of electron bombardment of the vacuum chamber walls and <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> gas desorption were also calculated.

40|$|Probing Defects and Electronic Processes on Gadolinia-doped Ceria Surfaces Using <b>Electron</b> <b>Stimulated</b> Desorption Haiyan Chen 133 Pages Directed by Professor Thomas M. Orlando Polycrystalline gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) {{has been}} widely {{investigated}} as a promising low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte {{and as part of}} composite electrodes. In this thesis, <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption (ESD) has been used to probe the defect related electronic properties of GDC surfaces and the interactions of water and molecular oxygen with these surfaces. In particular, the electron irradiation induced surface charging of GDC {{has been found to be}} dependent on the incident electron energy: negative at lower energy and positive at higher energy. Trapping of electrons and holes by the gadolinium aggregated, oxygen vacancy rich grain boundaries has been considered as the origin of surface charging. Depending on the sample treatment, there can be various defects, hydroxyl groups, chemically adsorbed water molecules, or water dimers on GDC surfaces. Water and molecular oxygen interact primarily with defect sites. Systematic investigations of <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> O+ desorption have yielded activation energies relevant to oxygen vacancy production on ceria surfaces, and to surface positive charge dissipation related to ionic conduction of GDC. Highly efficient <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> O+ desorption from GDC surfaces has been attributed to the lowered charge density on oxygen ions coordinated with oxygen vacancy clusters and thus may be used as a probe for surface defect types. <b>Electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption of O 2 + from GDC surfaces during molecular oxygen adsorption has shown the ability of ESD to detect chemically adsorbed O 2. The velocity distributions of O 2 + can be used to probe intermediate adsorption species such as O 2, as well as the positive charge of the surface. Overall, this thesis has demonstrated that ESD can provide important information on the kinetics and dynamics of surface charging, charge transport, adsorption and reactions occurring at defective insulating metal oxides materials. The abilities to probe the defects and their roles in surface processes make ESD a valuable technique for surface chemistry and catalysis studies. Ph. D.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of high-powered lasers to produce 50 - 100 keV x-ray sources for applications for programs such as Stockpile Stewardship and nuclear weapons effects testing (NWET). To produce these x-ray sources requires irradiating targets with intense laser light to efficiently generate high-energy <b>electrons.</b> <b>Stimulated</b> Raman scattering (SRS) of intense laser light produces electron plasma waves, which in turn generate high-energy electrons. To make a high-energy x-ray source, the maximization of this laser- driven instability is desired. Using computer simulations, we show that SRS can be driven by {{using a combination of}} frequency-tripled and a 'seed' beam of frequency doubled Neodymium laser light in a plasma of the appropriate density. Electron plasma waves with a high phase velocity are produced, which trap electrons and accelerate them to high energy. These energetic electrons will in turn generate high energy x-rays via collisions with nearby dense material. By adjusting the angle between the 0. 35 micrometers and 0. 53 micrometers laser beams, the characteristic temperature of the heated electrons (and the x-rays) can be varied. We show one and two-dimensional simulations and illustrate the important role that laser-driven ion fluctuations play...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultraviolet}} absorption properties of solvated halide ions are interpreted {{in terms of}} "charge-transfer to solvent", electronic transitions. Details of the optical absorption characteristics of solvated bromide and chloride anions extend the rigour of the accepted models. The apparent similarity between excited states of these ions and the ground states for solvated <b>electrons</b> <b>stimulated</b> an examination, by electron spin resonance (e. s. r.) and optical spectroscopy, of solvated electrons in hydroxide glasses and rigid organic solvents produced by ?-irradiation at 77 K.

The design and construction of a system with capabilities for the techniques mentioned, being an integral part of this project, are discussed. Two total removal cross-sections of hydrogen from Si(100) were obtained by analyzing <b>electron</b> <b>stimulated</b> desorption (ESD) data. By comparing the ESD data to the TPD traces obtained from disilane/Si(100), the cross-sections obtained were assigned to two adsorption states of hydrogen on Si(100).

In addition, the HREELS data unambiguously confirmed that the silicon dihydride state does not form on TMS-covered Si(100) surfaces. Similarly, TPD and HREELS data indicate that electron irradiation of digermane overlayers on Si(100) dissociates the parent molecules and deposits germanium on the surface.
