5|$|After {{splitting}} from I-295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane {{divided road}} called Crown Point Avenue. The route passes past an oil refinery before forming {{the border between}} West Deptford Township {{to the north and}} Westville to the south, where <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> pass residences along {{the south side of the}} road. The road fully enters Westville before encountering the northern terminus of Route 45 at a Y-intersection. Past this intersection, the lanes of US 130 split briefly before rejoining.|$|E
5|$|As SR 89A {{moves to}} the northeast, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> ascend the Black Hills {{mountain}} range. The roadway follows the terrain {{through a series of}} hairpin turns as it climbs in elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.|$|E

5|$|At State Street, NY38 leaves US20 and NY5 {{and heads}} north through the city's north side, {{crossing}} the Owasco Outlet and serving the Auburn Correctional Facility. The route passes through several blocks {{of commercial and}} residential development up to Grant Street, where <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> taper off. It ceases almost entirely near the northern city line at York Street, where the homes along the highway become more sporadic and spaced apart.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{enters his}} ship, the fleet rows {{forward for the}} attack, and battle ensues. The weather becomes thick in the north, the clouds cover the sky, {{daylight}} becomes sparse, thunder and lightning ring out, and <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> rain. The Jomvikings fleet fights facing the storm and cold, and they have trouble standing due to the heavy wind. The Jomsvikings throw weapons, missiles, and stones at Haakon's fleet but the winds turn their projectiles back at them.|$|E
5|$|Later, Doggett confronts Kersh, {{who was not}} {{implicated in}} the conspiracy. Kersh {{explains}} to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett, {{and that he had}} told Mulder to flee, but ultimately it was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so. Meanwhile, Scully dreams of McMahon's and Rohrer's lifeless bodies below the harbor. Suddenly, she sees McMahon's eyes snap open. Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William's mobile; <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> move on its own accord.|$|E

5|$|North of the Long Island Expressway, CR101 {{passes by}} the Christopher Morley Park and Golf Course {{to the east}} and {{residential}} neighborhoods to the west. Past the park, CR101 enters an area with more residential development as <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> run along the western boundary of Roslyn Estates and the eastern edge of Manhasset. The homes give way to commercial developments as the highway approaches Flower Hill and NY25A (Northern Boulevard). Searingtown Road becomes Port Washington Boulevard and CR101 becomes NY101 upon intersecting NY25A.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut {{potassium}} is silvery in appearance, but <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air. In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E
5|$|The anime ends differently, with no {{life-threatening}} {{situation and}} Hazumu choosing Yasuna {{in order to}} help cure her worsening sight problem as <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> degrade so she can no longer see girls as well. Afterwards however, Yasuna, who becomes able to see all people again, decides to break up with Hazumu, saying she can stand on her own, and in the follow-up original video animation episode, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> collapse under its own gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a {{voracious}} predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> heat excessively.|$|E

Traditionally the Berber element of the army had the strongest sway over political affairs, but as the Turkish element grew more powerful, <b>it</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> challenge this, and by 1020 serious riots had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> break out among the Black African troops who were fighting back against a Berber-Turk Alliance.|$|R

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. <b>It</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> take in cool, moist {{air from the}} {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. <b>It</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|I-87 takes a northerly track from US11, {{crossing}} the Great Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past {{a series of}} homes and businesses built up along nearby US9. As both roads head north out of the village, US9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canadian border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as <b>it</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> run past the customs facilities on the American side of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canadian border, where the highway continues past the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15.|$|E
