A beam of <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> penetrates the brain tissue to a depth reaching the tumor.

50|$|Neutron {{tools are}} based on the {{measurement}} of a neutron cloud of different energy levels within the investigated volume. Epithermal-neutron tools measure <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> density with energy levels between 100eV and 0.1eV in the formation. Thermal-neutron tools only measure the population of neutrons with a thermal energy level, and Neutron-gamma tools measure the intensity of gamma flux generated by thermal neutron capture. The tools usually have two detectors (or more) with different spacings from the source to produce ratio of count rates, which theoretically reduce borehole effects.|$|E
5000|$|The neutron {{porosity}} log {{works by}} bombarding a formation with high energy <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> that lose energy through elastic scattering to near thermal levels before being {{absorbed by the}} nuclei of the formation atoms. Depending on the particular type of neutron logging tool, either the gamma ray of capture, scattered thermal neutrons or scattered, higher energy <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> are detected. [...] The neutron porosity log is predominantly sensitive to the quantity of hydrogen atoms in a particular formation, which generally corresponds to rock porosity.|$|R

This material is a scintillator, which measurably glows when it interacts with thermal and <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons.</b> LunaH-Map's neutron detector will consist of an array of sixteen 2.5×2.5×2 cm CLYC scintillators.|$|R
50|$|Cross {{sections}} {{for both}} capture and fission reactions often have multiple resonance peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range.These are of less significance in a fast neutron reactor, where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing {{down to this}} range, or in a well-moderated thermal reactor, where <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either fissile or fertile actinide nuclides.However, in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for transient changes in reactivity that might make reactor control more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Since both tumor and {{surrounding}} normal tissues {{are present in}} the radiation field, even with an ideal <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam, there will be an unavoidable, nonspecific background dose, consisting of both high and low LET radiation. However, a higher concentration of 10B in the tumor will result in it receiving a higher total dose than that of adjacent normal tissues, which is the basis for the therapeutic gain in BNCT. The total radiation dose in Gy delivered to any tissue can be expressed in photon-equivalent units as the sum of each of the high LET dose components multiplied by weighting factors (Gyw), which depend on the increased radiobiological effectiveness of each of these components.|$|E
5000|$|Neutrons are {{typically}} emitted by a radioactive source such as Americium Beryllium (Am-Be) or Plutonium Beryllium (Pu-Be), or generated by electronic neutron generators such as minitron. Fast neutrons are emitted by these sources with energy ranges from 4 MeV to 14 MeV, and inelastically interact with matter. Once slowed down to 2 MeV, {{they start to}} scatter elastically and slow down further until the neutrons reach a thermal energy level of about 0.025 eV. When thermal neutrons are then absorbed, gamma rays are emitted. A suitable detector, positioned at a certain distance from the source, can measure either <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> population, thermal neutron population, or the gamma rays emitted after the absorption.|$|E
50|$|BNCT of {{patients}} with brain tumors was resumed in the United States in the mid-1990s by Chanana, Diaz, and Coderre and their co-workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) and at Harvard/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) using the MIT Research Reactor (MITR). For the first time, BPA {{was used as the}} boron delivery agent, and patients were irradiated with a collimated beam of higher energy epithermal neutrons, which had greater tissue-penetrating properties than thermal neutrons. A research group headed up by Zamenhof at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and MIT was the first to use an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam for clinical trials. Initially patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated and this was expanded to include patients with brain tumors, specifically melanoma metastatic to the brain and primary glioblastomas (GBMs). Included in the research team were Otto Harling at MIT and the Radiation Oncologist Paul Busse at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. A total of 22 patients were treated by the Harvard-MIT research group. Five patients with cutaneous melanomas were treated using an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam at the MIT research reactor (MITR-II) and subsequently patients with brain tumors were treated using a redesigned beam at the MIT reactor which possessed far superior characteristics to the original MITR-II beam, and BPA as the capture agent. The clinical outcome of the cases treated at Harvard-MIT has been summarized by Busse. Although the treatment was well tolerated, {{there were no significant differences}} in the mean survival times {{of patients}} that had received BNCT compared to those who received conventional external beam X-irradiation.|$|E

40|$|Achieving {{agreement}} between measured and calculated neutron activation data resulting from Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb detonations {{has been a}} major problem since the early 1980 's. This has been particularly true for the materials that are activated by thermal and <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons.</b> Since thermal and <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> are not transported very far from the weapon, the local shielding environment around the measurement location can be very important. A set of calculations incorporating an average density local-environment material (mush) has been made to demonstrate that the local environment {{plays an important role in}} the calculation-measurement agreement process. The optimum solution would be to include the local environment in all thermal neutron response calculations...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} real time {{internal}} diagnostics of arcjet engines are described. One method uses cold, thermal, or <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutrons.</b> Cold neutrons {{are used to}} detect the presence and location of hydrogenous propellants. Thermal neutrons are used to delineate the edge contours of anode and cathode surfaces and to measure stress/strain. <b>Epithermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> are used to measure temperatures on arcjet surfaces, bulk material temperatures, and point temperatures in bulk materials. It is found that this method, with an exposure time of 10 min, produces at temperature accuracy for W or Re of + or - 2. 5 C.

50|$|The WSU TRIGA reactor has an {{external}} <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam facility. This beam is a well-collimated, high-flux, medium energy dry neutron beam. It {{can also be}} modified to generate low energy neutrons. This beam facility is enclosed in a special high-radiation area room, and was built {{in conjunction with the}} Idaho National Engineering Laboratory for cancer research. Ongoing projects include Boron-Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) research, especially that research for a cure for brain tumors, although the beam can be used for any neutron-capture therapy. This beam can also be used for neutron radiography, a non-destructive technique for examining 'heavy' materials such as steel for internal 'light' materials, such as cracks in castings, voids in welds, or fluid flows inside pipes.|$|E
50|$|Biological {{weighting}} {{factors have been}} used in all of the recent clinical trials in patients with high grade gliomas, using boronophenylalanine (BPA) in combination with an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam. The 10B(n,α)7Li component of the radiation dose to the scalp has been based on the measured boron concentration in the blood at the time of BNCT, assuming a blood: scalp boron concentration ratio of 1.5:1 and a compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor for BPA in skin of 2.5. A relative biological effectiveness (RBE) factor of 3.2 has been used in all tissues for the high LET components of the beam, such as alpha particles. The RBE factor is used to compare the biologic effectiveness of different types of ionizing radiation. The high LET components include protons resulting from the capture reaction with normal tissue nitrogen, and recoil protons resulting from the collision of fast neutrons with hydrogen. It must be emphasized that the tissue distribution of the boron delivery agent in humans should be similar to that in the experimental animal model in order to use the experimentally derived values for estimation of the radiation doses for clinical radiations. For more detailed information relating to computational dosimetry and treatment planning, interested readers are referred to a comprehensive review on this subject.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of boron {{delivery}} agents have been synthesized, but only two of these currently are being used in clinical trials. The first, which has been used primarily in Japan, is a polyhedral borane anion, sodium borocaptate or BSH (Na2B12H11SH), {{and the second is}} a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, referred to as boronophenylalanine or BPA. The latter has been used in clinical trials in the United States, Finland, Japan and more recently, Argentina and Taiwan. Following administration of either BPA or BSH by intravenous infusion, the tumor site is irradiated with neutrons, the source of which up until now has been specially designed nuclear reactors. Until 1994, low-energy (< 0.5 eV) thermal neutron beams were used in Japan and the United States, but since they have a limited depth of penetration in tissues, higher energy (>.5eV<10 keV) <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beams, which have a greater depth of penetration, have been used in clinical trials in the United States, Europe, Japan, Argentina, Taiwan, and China. In theory BNCT is a highly selective type of radiation therapy that can target tumor cells without causing radiation damage to the adjacent normal cells and tissues. Doses up to 60-70 grays can be delivered to the tumor cells in one or two applications compared to 6-7 weeks for conventional fractionated external beam photon irradiation. However, the effectiveness of BNCT is dependent upon a relatively homogeneous cellular distribution of 10B within the tumor, and this {{is still one of the}} main unsolved problems that have limited its success.|$|E
50|$|Some {{reactors}} {{are used}} for the neutron irradiation of samples for radioisotope production {{for a range of}} purposes.

5000|$|Finally, to {{conclude}} this section, {{the following is}} a brief summary of a clinical trial that was carried out by Stenstam, Sköld, Capala and their co-workers in Sweden using BPA and an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam at the Studsvik nuclear reactor, which had greater tissue penetration properties than the thermal beams originally used in Japan. This study differed significantly from all previous clinical trials in that the total amount of BPA administered was increased (900 mg/kg), and it was infused i.v. over 6 hours. This was based on experimental animal studies in glioma bearing rats demonstrating enhanced uptake of BPA by infiltrating tumor cells following a 6-hour infusion. The longer infusion time of the BPA was well tolerated by the 30 patients who were enrolled in this study. All were treated with 2 fields, and the average whole brain dose was 3.2-6.1 Gy (weighted), and the minimum dose to the tumor ranged from 15.4 to 54.3 Gy (w). There has been some disagreement among the Swedish investigators regarding the evaluation of the results. Based on incomplete survival data, the MeST was reported as 14.2 months and the time to tumor progression was 5.8 months. However, more careful examination [...] of the complete survival data revealed that the MeST was 17.7 months compared to 15.5 months that has been reported for patients who received standard therapy of surgery, followed by radiotherapy (RT) and the drug temozolomide (TMZ). Furthermore, the frequency of adverse events was lower after BNCT (14%) than after radiation therapy (RT) alone (21%) and both of these were lower than those seen following RT in combination with TMZ. If this improved survival data, obtained using the higher dose of BPA and a 6-hour infusion time, can be confirmed by others, preferably in a randomized clinical trial, it could represent a significant step forward in BNCT of brain tumors, especially if combined with a photon boost.|$|E

40|$|Activation foils, {{stacked in}} a package, {{together}} with a spectrum adjustment code are generally the means to characterize the neutron spectrum of a BNCT <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam. When using foil stacks, the phenomenon of neutron scattering is appreciably enhanced, especially in an <b>epithermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam, as compared to a thermal neutron field. Contrary to the conventional idea of the self-shielding effect, self-shielding correction factors {{in most of the}} foils in the stack are larger than one.
