40|$|A major {{environmental}} issue for hydro-electric power generation is passage of fish through turbines, or entrainment onto trash racks. At Yarrawonga Weir, {{on the upper}} Murray River in south-eastern Australia, the positioning of a <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> resulted in the potential for upstream migrating fish to be swept back into the adjacent power station by cross flows. In 2004, a 4. 5 -m long steel extension flume {{was attached to the}} exit to alleviate this problem. To determine the fate of native fish after exiting the extension flume, 72 individuals (305 - 1015 mm long) were implanted with radio-transmitters and released into the <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> exit channel. In 2004 (power station inflows 10 300 ML day(- 1)), the majority of fish exited successfully (44 of 45) and only a single fish (2 %) was entrained into the power station. In 2005 (power station inflows 12 000 ML day(- 1)), fish again exited successfully (26 of 27) but with a higher proportion entrained (5 of 27; 18 %). This reduced success appeared to be related to strong transverse flows with high water velocities adjacent to the <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> exit. The efficiency of fish passage at this site might be improved by altering water management strategies, integrating engineering and fish biology, and through field-testing of proposed solutions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> at the dam of the {{reservoir}} Höllensteinsee (river Schwarzer Regen, Germany) {{was built in}} 2013. The dam has a level difference of 13 m and is used for energy production. The <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> was constructed in an old bottom outlet channel. The necessary dotation of 500 liters per second is energetically used by a micro turbine. In the year 2014 a monitoring was realized to proof {{the function of the}} <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> for upstream fish migration. Because of the water depth {{it was not possible to}} install fyke nets, thereby a simple, economical system with four waterproof video cameras, IR-spotlights and a computer equipped with an observation software was used. The cameras were installed at upper and lower entrance of the lock. Over a period of 127 controlling days about 1400 fish of 12 species were sighted while leaving the upper entrance. Unfortunately the observation of the lower entrance showed a significant lack of entering the lock. Many fishes hesitated to enter the lock chamber or leave it again. Because of this, different parameters of the lock were changed: duration of the lock cycle (especially the duration of entering period), reduction of flow velocity in the lock chamber and installing a daylight spotlight within the chamber. Especially the illumination tends to result in higher passage rates. Also shorter entering periods of maximum 20 minutes show slight effects. The period to exit the chamber should take about 30 minutes, but most of the individuals leave the chamber within the first 3 minutes after opening the door. There is no evidence that the <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> is used by a significant amount of downstream migrating fish. In spring 2015 the investigations will be continued to show more clearly the efficiency of the illumination and the duration of entrance period...|$|E

40|$|Migrating {{fish that}} swim {{upstream}} in rivers for reproduction need to overcome obstructions, such as hydropower plants. If a fishway {{is used to}} help the fish pass such an obstacle, water {{needs to be taken}} from the dam without first passing through the turbines. Also, the fish may have difficulties finding the fishway, due to the dominating flow from the turbine tailrace. A <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> that uses turbine tailwater to entice the fish into the lock and further on to a fishway is studied. The <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> is a shallow open channel that uses {{a small fraction of the}} tailwater. A local acceleration of the flow is created by changing the cross sectional area of the lock channel. Measurements are concentrated on how to design the lock so enough water passes through and a sufficient velocity increment is reached.

It is focused on long-term sustainable investments adapting all present river obstacles to allow fish migration (upstream and downstream); increasing twice the river spawning habitat availability, and the distribution and growth areas of migrating fish. Main activities of the LIFE MIGRATOEBRE project are: 1. Apply ship locks fish-friendly improved management at Xerta’s weir (located at 58 km from the sea) and at Flix dam (located at 115 km from the sea), and to monitor it regularly. 2. Install a <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> at Xerta’s weir, and a fish ramp at Ascó’s weir (located at 104 km from the sea), and to monitor it regularly. 3.

40|$|A major {{environmental}} impact of dams and weirs throughout {{the world is the}} prevention of fish migration. To ameliorate this impact and aid fish migration, fishways or 2 ̆ 7 fish ladders 2 ̆ 7 have frequently been built. Fishways are generally a channel divided into pools by baffles, and fish ascend by swimming from pool to pool. In addition to the common pool-type fishways, there are Denil fishways, <b>fish</b> <b>locks,</b> <b>fish</b> pumps, fish gondolas and trap-and-transport facilities. Most of the fishways throughout the world have been built in the northern hemisphere, and almost all of these have been designed for salmonid fish species.

In the last 10 years Dr. Mallen-Cooper has had a significant focus on broader linkages for fish passage and fish migration within catchments and between rivers and floodplains, and maximizing benefits for fish from environmental flows. Southern Hemisphere fish passage is different although the underlying principles are the same.

40|$|Dams and weirs {{are widely}} implicated in {{large-scale}} declines {{in both the}} range and abundance of aquatic fauna. Although many factors are involved, such declines are commonly attributed to the prevention or reduction of migration, reductions in available habitat, alteration of natural flow regimes and changes to physicochemical characteristics. In Australia, studies into the ecological effects of these impacts are limited, and have concentrated mainly on species of recreational and commercial importance. Subsequently, the adverse effects of dams and weirs, and suitable methods of mitigation, remain largely unknown for many other taxa. Therefore, the major aim of this thesis is to investigate the ecological effects of dam and weir construction on previously unstudied migratory assemblages of fish and macroinvertebrates in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is anticipated {{that the results of}} these studies will feed back into improved management strategies that help arrest the previously observed declines of aquatic fauna. Initially, fish communities were sampled, by boat electrofishing, from both reference sites and downstream of Balranald and Redbank weirs on the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River, Australia. Sampling was stratified over large spatial and temporal scales to gain a comprehensive understanding of species most affected by the presence of these two barriers. In general, the weirs obstructed fish migrations during summer and autumn and many species of small-bodied fish such as Australian smelt, western carp gudgeon, fly-specked hardyhead and crimson-spotted rainbowfish accumulated downstream of Balranald Weir. In addition, downstream accumulations of juveniles of larger-bodied species such as bony herring, common carp and goldfish were also detected. Although many previous studies had either documented or hypothesised that upstream migrating fish accumulate downstream of migration barriers, none attempted to quantify the size of such populations. Therefore, a simple but efficient method to estimate the size of migratory populations was assessed at the Balranald Weir site. The application of two commonly used estimation techniques yielded relatively reliable results for seven species that accumulated downstream of the weir. Population size estimates were greatest for most species during summer and autumn, where accumulations as high as 800 fish per day were detected. The largest calculated population size estimates, in addition to the greatest temporal variation, of any individual species was observed in bony herring. Given the simplicity of the technique and the relative accuracy of population estimates, it was concluded that these methods could easily be applied to other weirs where the size of migratory populations is of particular interest. A study investigating the effects of Yanco Weir on the diets of three migratory percichthyid species, Murray cod, trout cod and golden perch was also conducted. Observed spatial variation in a number of trophic processes strongly implicated Yanco Weir as a major contributor to increased competition among percichthyid species on the Murrumbidgee River. The greater relative abundance of percichthyids from downstream samples, combined with increases in dietary overlap and a greater percentage of empty stomachs, also suggested percichthyids may be significantly affecting the relative abundance of potential prey items such as freshwater prawns and Australian smelt. These significant changes in dietary composition were likely related to migratory behaviour, as these species accumulated downstream of the weir, and could be readily expected at other sites where passage is obstructed. It was suggested that the construction of suitable fish passage facilities would effectively reduce the probability of migratory fish accumulating and, subsequently, potential effects of dams and weirs on trophic processes. Since it was established that dams and weirs of the Murrumbidgee River were significantly affecting migratory fish communities, an innovative but relatively inexpensive fishway design, the Deelder <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> (after Deelder, 1958), was constructed and assessed for wider application throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. The Deelder lock was effective at mitigating the effects of Balranald Weir by providing passage {{for a wide range of}} size classes and species of fish; but importantly, the structure enabled the passage of most species previously observed to accumulate downstream of the structure. Most significant was the ability of the <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> to pass substantial numbers of small-bodied fish, which were previously not considered migratory, suggesting that these species should be considered when developing options to mitigate the effects of other dams and weirs throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. A significant finding of this study was the realisation that substantially more species and size classes of Australian native fish are migratory than previously thought. Subsequently, it is recommended that, when designing facilities to mitigate the effects of a dam or weir, the structure of the entire migratory community is considered when developing operating parameters. Various options for mitigating the effects of dams and weirs are discussed, but it was concluded that the construction of effective fishways would be the most appropriate means of restoring migration pathways to Australian native fish. A strategic approach for assessing and adaptively mitigating the effects of dams and weirs is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The average catch {{per unit}} of swept area (CPUE) from bottom trawl surveys by {{research}} vessels are used as an index of abundance for the demersal fish resources of the Thai waters of the Andaman Sea. The surveys are carried out under the assumption of constant swept area and catch efficiency. However, preliminary investigations showed that the geometry varied by depth and based on other studies {{it is likely that}} this may affect CPUE. To reduce the variability in trawl geometry by depth, the constrictor rope technique was applied. The length of the rope (6 m) and its position (between the warps; 100 ahead of the trawl doors) were based on trials without rope at the shallowest depth trawled during the routine surveys (20 m). Using the constrictor rope at deeper depths gave similar trawl geometry as obtained at the reference depth of 20 m. When the trawl was fished with the constrictor rope 75 m depth, the mean door distance was reduced by 23 % compared to the door distance obtained for hauls without a constrictor rope. Similarly, wing distance was reduced by 18 % and the angle of the sweep/bridles was reduced from 20. 3 to 15 degrees (26 % reduction). The vertical trawl opening was increased marginally (0. 12 m; 6. 5 %) Despite the difference in trawl geometry, catch rates and catch composition did not differ significantly between the hauls made with and without the constrictor rope. The reason for this is unclear, but it is suggested that the larger area swept when no rope is used is offset by increased escape below the fishing line due to the trawl being overspread. Observations by underwater video cameras in the net mouth area during hauls at shallow depth and without constrictor rope, indicated proper bottom contact of the fishing line. It is therefore suggested that the trawl will have similar bottom contact at all depths when the constrictor rope is used. However, this needs to be verified. Observations of fish showed that fish took up position slightly in front of the fishing line, swimming in the direction of towing. Except for a few rays, no fish were observed to escape below the fishing line. Observations of trawl's <b>fish</b> <b>lock</b> showed that this did not function as intended as fish were observed to swim forward out of the codend during haul back of the trawl. v Sections of gillnet panels mounted to the outside of the top panel of the trawl, showed only marked escape during one haul and only close to the codend.

40|$|Abstract: To provide {{passage of}} {{migrating}} sturgeons through dams, we have, first of all, {{to monitor and}} control their behavior in the water flow. To achieve this, {{we have to know}} following behavioral and ecological traits such as: rheoreaction, threshold and critical swimming velocity, swimming endurance, behavior in the flow velocity gradient, diel and seasonal patterns of spawning migrations, and vertical and horizontal distribution of migrating sturgeons. Such information is needed to determine optimum flow velocities attracting fish to the entrance of a fish pass (FP), FP operation regime, duration of attraction of migrants, location of the entrance to FP downstream the dam, and conditions at the fish release site upstream the dam. Since 1955 to 2005, 16 FP, to enhance fish spawning migration, were built at 11 large dams in the basins of rivers Volga, Don, and Kuban. One of the main functions of the FP was to facilitate spawning migration of sturgeons - Huso huso, Acipenser gueldenstaedti, A. stellatus, and A. ruthenus. Several types of FP were built: hydraulic (1 FP) and mechanic (2) <b>fish</b> lifts; <b>fish</b> <b>locks</b> (10), natural (spawning) bypass channels (2), and experimental floating FP (1). Most of them were efficient. Efficiency of some FP was as high as 67 % (of the number of approached fish; river Don – Kochetovskii powerplant). The number of sturgeons that passed through the Volgogradskaya dam (river Volga) reached 60000 ind. per year (1967); 2050 ind. (Kochetovskaya dam, 1975); 2130 ind. through the Fedorovskaya dam (river Kuban, 1987). In the 1990 s, the number of sturgeons in the Russian rivers decreased dramatically, mainly due to heavy poaching. This resulted in an abrupt decrease of the number of passed fish. In consequence, operation of some FP was suspende...|$|R

40|$|Many {{fish species}} {{undertake}} {{more or less}} extended migrations {{as part of their}} basic behaviour. Amongst the best known examples in Europe are salmon (Salmo salar) and sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), which often swim several thousands of kilometres when returning from the sea to their spawning grounds in rivers. In addition to these long-distance migratory species other fish and invertebrates undertake more or less short-term or small-scale migrations from one part of the river to another at certain phases of their life cycles. Fish passes are of increasing importance for the restoration of free passage for fish and other aquatic species in rivers as such devices are often {{the only way to make}} it possible for aquatic fauna to pass obstacles that block their up-river journey. The fish passes thus become key elements for the ecological improvement of running waters. Their efficient functioning is a prerequisite for the restoration of free passage in rivers. However, studies of existing devices have shown that many of them do not function correctly. Therefore, various stakeholders, e. g. engineers, biologists, and administrators have declared great interest in generally valid design criteria and instructions that correspond to the present state-of-the-art of experience and knowledge. The present Guidelines first refer to the underlying ecological basics and discuss the general requirements that must be understood for sensible application of the complex interdisciplinary matters. These general considerations are followed by technical recommendations and advice for the design and evaluation of fish passes as well as by proposals for choosing their hydraulic dimensions correctly and testing the functioning. Fishways can be constructed in a technically utilitarian way or in a manner meant to emulate nature. Bypass channels and fish ramps are among the more natural solutions, while the more technical solutions include conventional pool-type passes, slot passes, fish lifts, hydraulic <b>fish</b> <b>locks,</b> and eel ladders. All these types are dealt with in this book. Furthermore, particular emphasis is laid on the importance of comprehensive monitoring. These Guidelines deal with mitigation of the upstream migration only as data on improvement of downstream passage was scarce at the time of preparation of the first edition, published in German in 1996. Therefore, the complex theme of downstream migration is ony touched on but not developed in depth...|$|R

However, less effort has been made to study how robotic fish can bene- fit from collective hydrodynamics they generate while they are swimming together cooperatively.

Firstly, the gun {{can be used to}} push off sharks or signal the boat driver, and secondly to prevent loss of the gun should the fish break the line, or should the spearfisher lose grip on the buoy. This setup can be used in conjunction with elastic bungee-style rope and a body board style float with locking cleats. This respectively maintains constant pressure on the fish and allows the spearfisher to rest while being towed around.

40|$|Providing fish passage at high-head {{hydroelectric}} facilities can be {{prohibitively expensive}} {{due to the}} challenges associated with maintaining acceptable velocities and pressures for fish migrating over a large drop in elevation. Traditional solutions involve large concrete structures such as <b>fish</b> ladders, <b>locks,</b> lifts, or bypass flumes. Hauling operations are another option, using transport trucks, but these can also be prohibitively expensive due to high operating costs. Equally important, they can cause significant stress and delay for migrating fishes. An innovative, cost-effective system for downstream fish passage at high-head hydropower facilities has been developed, and is currently awaiting prototype-scale testing. The system uses engineered decompression raceways to safely pass fish using conventional screens by regulating pressures and controlling bypass flows. The development of the decompression raceway allows proven in-conduit screening systems, such as Eicher-type or MIS-type screens, to be used at high-head hydropower facilities because it solves the problem of controlled decompression at the discharge location. Results from Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model tests verify the hydraulic performance of the decompression raceways {{and their ability to}} meet fish passage criteria. Hyperbaric pressure tests on salmonids verify low injury and mortality rates during controlled decompression scenarios. Decompression raceways expand the applicability of existing screening methods to allow volitional downstream fish movement at high-head facilities with minimal delay and a small physical footprint. This presentation will be of interest to a diverse blend of stakeholders, including federal, state and local agencies, seeking a viable approach to add lower-cost fish passage at high-head hydropower projects...|$|R

As a case study, Escherichia coli, the major cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), and three other atypical colonizers of urinary catheters (Delftia tsuruhatensis, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Burkholderia fungorum) with unproven pathogenic potential, were selected. Specific probes for these species were designed and optimized for specific hybridization in multiplex experiments. Results showed that the LNA/ 2 OMe-FISH method performed well in multiplex experiments and presented a good correlation with total and cultivability counts, regardless of the cells physiological state. In fact, the method was also able to report variations of viable but non-cultivable populations. Further analysis of mixed biofilm structures by confocal laser scanning microscopy provided a clear discrimination in three dimensions between the location of the different populations.
