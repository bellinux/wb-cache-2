5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision maker, had {{a talent for}} selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of}} the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too.

5|$|Yardley {{had a good}} {{technique}} for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fielder in positions close to the batsmen.|$|E

He alternated between forward and defense throughout minor hockey. When he began attending Cushing Academy he was a forward the first year, before he converted to a defender full-time.

5|$|Robert of Jumièges (died between 1052 and 1055) was {{the first}} Norman Archbishop of Canterbury. He had {{previously}} served as prior of the Abbey of St Ouen at Rouen in Normandy, before becoming abbot of Jumièges Abbey, near Rouen, in 1037. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend and adviser to the king of England, Edward the Confessor, who appointed him Bishop of London in 1044, and then archbishop in 1051. Robert's time as archbishop lasted only about eighteen months. He had already come into conflict with the powerful Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and while archbishop made attempts to recover lands lost to Godwin and his family.

5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbald lived until 757 {{and carried}} Mercian {{power to a}} new height. His debt to Crowland was not forgotten: soon after his {{accession}} he richly endowed a new church on the site where Guthlac had lived as a hermit. The first Life of Guthlac, written by the monk Felix, appeared soon after Guthlac's death. Nothing is known about Felix, although Bertram Colgrave has observed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scholar who evidently had access to works by Bede and Aldhelm, to a Life of Saint Fursey and Latin works by Saint Jerome, Saint Athanasius and Gregory the Great. Felix was either an East Anglian or {{was living in the}} kingdom when he wrote the book, which was written at the request of Ælfwald. In the Life, Felix portrays Æthelbald's exile at Crowland and asserts Ælfwald's right to rule in East Anglia. Two Old English verse versions of the Life drawn on the work of Felix were written, which show the vigour of vernacular heroic and elegiac modes in Ælfwald's kingdom.|$|E
