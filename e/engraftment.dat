Prior to the administration of new cells (<b>engraftment)</b> patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB), {{and more specifically}} the p 65 subunit, significantly improves the phenotype of mdx mice, a murine DMD model. However, the ubiquity of NF-κB stands {{as an obstacle to}} clinical translation. In this dissertation, we explore the roles of NF-κB/p 65 in the regenerative capacity of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) with the goal of identifying alternative approaches to DMD treatment. We found that both cell proliferation and myogenic potential were increased in MDSCs lacking one allele of p 65 (p 65 +/-). In wild type MDSCs, in vitro pharmacologic inhibition of the upstream activating kinase, IKKβ, increased myotube formation in a dose-dependent manner. When transplanted into mdx hind limb muscle, p 65 +/- MDSCs resulted in significantly larger <b>engraftments.</b> Furthermore, <b>engraftments</b> in cardiotoxin (CTX) injured muscle were associated with reduced local host necrosis and inflammation. Not only were p 65 +/- MDSCs found to be more resistant to oxidative stress, but we found that p 65 depletion improved the anti-inflammatory capacity of MDSCs in vitro and in vivo via upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Moreover, accelerated regeneration in p 65 haploinsufficient mdx mice (mdx;p 65 +/-) coincided with HGF upregulation. Intraperitoneal injection of a musculotropic adeno-associated virus carrying shRNA targeting HGF reversed the phenotypic improvements of mdx;p 65 +/- mice, increasing both muscle inflammation and necrosis. These data implicate NF-κB/p 65 in muscle stem cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and growth factor gene expression, further underlining the danger of broadly targeting such an important pathway. Finally, this research has also identified HGF as a downstream effector of NF-κB/p 65 inhibition in mdx mice. Thus, delivery of HGF or activation of its receptor, MET, may represent a new approach to reduce chronic inflammation and preserve muscle fiber integrity in DMD...|$|R

However, most hiPSC-derived CMs morphologically and functionally resemble immature rather than adult CMs, which could hamper their application. Here, we obtained high-quality cardiac tissue-like constructs (CTLCs) by cultivating hiPSC-CMs on low-thickness aligned nanofibers made of biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer. We show that multilayered and elongated CMs could be organized at high density along aligned nanofibers in a simple one-step seeding process, resulting in upregulated cardiac biomarkers and enhanced cardiac functions. When used for drug assessment, CTLCs were much more robust than the 2 D conventional control. We also demonstrated the potential of CTLCs for modeling <b>engraftments</b> in vitro and treating myocardial infarction in vivo.

Here, we generated a monoclonal antibody against recurrent HCC, 1 B 50 - 1, that bound the isoform 5 of the α 2 δ 1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels and identified {{a subset of}} tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with stem cell-like properties. A surgical margin with cells detected by 1 B 50 - 1 predicted rapid recurrence. Furthermore, 1 B 50 - 1 had a therapeutic effect on HCC <b>engraftments</b> by eliminating TICs. Finally, α 2 δ 1 knockdown reduced self-renewal and tumor formation capacities and induced apoptosis of TICs, whereas its overexpression led to enhanced sphere formation, which is regulated by calcium influx. Thus, α 2 δ 1 is a functional liver TIC marker, and its inhibitors may serve as potential anti-HCC drugs...|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been found that calcium ions can act as {{chemotactic}} signals to HSCs via the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).

Conversely, stimulation of HSC CaSR via its agonist cinacalcet increases migration and <b>engraftment</b> of these cells in the bone marrow. Finally, osteoclast inhibition by the bisphosphonate alendronate has correlated with decreased HSCs and bone marrow <b>engraftment.</b> Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} the high calcium ion concentration found in the endosteal niche due to osteoclast activity acts as a homing signal to HSCs for <b>engraftment</b> into the bone marrow via the CaSR.|$|E

40|$|How metastases develop is {{not well}} {{understood}} and no genetic mutations have been reported as specific metastatic drivers. Here we have addressed the idea that epigenetic reprogramming by GLI-regulated pluripotent stemness factors promotes metastases. Using primary human colon cancer cells engrafted in mice, we find that transient expression of OCT 4, SOX 2, KLF 4 +/- cMYC establishes an enhanced pro-metastatic state in the primary tumor that is stable through sequential <b>engraftments</b> and is transmitted through clonogenic cancer stem cells. Metastatic reprogramming alters NANOG methylation and stably boosts NANOG and NANOGP 8 expression. Metastases and reprogrammed EMT-like phenotypes require endogenous NANOG, but enhanced NANOG {{is not sufficient to}} induce these phenotypes. Finally, reprogrammed tumors enhance GLI 2, and we show that GLI 2 (high) and AXIN 2 (low), which are markers of the metastatic transition of colon cancers, are prognostic of poor disease outcome in patients.

40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) possess certain {{immunomodulatory}} properties; the defined components in ESCs, however, are largely unknown. Based on proteomic database, I report here that milk fat globule {{epidermal growth factor}} 8 (MFG-E 8) is a key component in ESCs to suppress T cell activation and regulate T cell polarization. MFG-E 8 is enriched in undifferentiated ESCs while diminishing in differentiated ESCs. Neutralizing ESC-derived MFG-E 8 substantially ameliorates the suppressive effects of ESCs on T cell activation and proliferation. Additionally, MFG-E 8 in ESCs is capable of up-regulating T regulatory cells. I further prove that MFG-E 8 suppresses T cell activation and regulates T cell polarization through inhibiting PKCθ phosphorylation. In vivo teratoma formation assay reveals an increase in ESC <b>engraftments</b> across allogeneic barriers with less immunologic rejection by up-regulation of MFG-E 8 expression in ESCs, further validating the immunosuppressive properties of MFG-E 8.

Using skin <b>engraftments</b> and anti-inflammatory drugs, we show that these features are not attributable to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather NFkB activation. Both in vivo and in vitro, p 120 null epidermal cells activate nuclear NFkB, triggering a cascade of proinflammatory NFkB targets. Although the underlying mechanism is likely complex, we show that p 120 affects NFkB activation and immune homeostasis in part through regulation of Rho GTPases.

Chromatin within stem cells is dynamic and relaxed, allowing transcription and thus lineage specification to occur rapidly. To determine how this property {{can be used}} to enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), I examined whether the expression of histone variants or peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (Ppiases) could increase the hyperdynamic, plastic nature of stem cell chromatin and thereby increase the efficiency and speed of reprogramming. I used molecular cloning to generate expression vectors containing the histone variants H 3 T and H 2 A. B. I used line-scanning microscopy to measure chromatin dynamics, with initial results suggesting that stem cells are more hyperdynamic in nature than differentiated cells. Although the research on the effect of histone variants and Ppiases on chromatin dynamics and reprogramming was not completed, another study showed that the expression of other histone variants does enhance reprogramming and may also induce an open chromatin structure. If this holds true for the histone variants studied here or Ppiase B (PpiB), this could further enhance the generation of iPSC and make future autologous <b>engraftments</b> of iPSC more feasible...|$|R
