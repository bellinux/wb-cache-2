50|$|In {{recent years}} ISM bands {{have also been}} shared with (non-ISM) license-free error-tolerant {{communications}} applications such as wireless sensor networks in the 915 MHz and 2.450 GHz bands, as well as wireless LANs and cordless phones in the 915 MHz, 2.450 GHz, and 5.800 GHz bands. Because unlicensed devices are required to be tolerant of ISM emissions in these bands, unlicensed low power users are generally able to operate in these bands without causing problems for ISM users. <b>ISM</b> <b>equipment</b> does not necessarily include a radio receiver in the ISM band (e.g. a microwave oven {{does not have a}} receiver).|$|E
5000|$|The 33-centimeter or 900 MHz band is {{a portion}} of the UHF radio {{spectrum}} internationally allocated to amateur radio on a secondary basis. It ranges from 902 to 928 MHz and is unique to ITU Region 2. [...] It is primarily used for very local communications as opposed to bands lower in frequency. However, very high antennas with high gain have shown 33 centimeters can provide good long range communications almost equal to systems on lower frequencies such as the 70 centimeter band. The band is also used by industrial, scientific, and medical (<b>ISM)</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as low powered unlicensed devices. Amateur stations must accept harmful interference caused by ISM users but may receive protection from unlicensed devices.|$|E
50|$|The ISM {{bands are}} defined by the ITU Radio Regulations (article 5) in {{footnotes}} 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the Radio Regulations. Individual countries' use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from <b>ISM</b> <b>equipment,</b> unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low. In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, while Part 15 contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the ETSI is responsible for governing ISM bands.|$|E
50|$|Other {{countries}} have licensed and unlicensed personal radio services with somewhat similar characteristics, but technical details and operating conditions {{vary according to}} national rules. Many European countries use a similar 8 channel system near 446 MHz known as PMR446, {{as well as a}} 69-channel low-power LPD433 which is shared with the <b>ISM</b> band. GMRS <b>equipment</b> that is approved for use in the United States will not communicate with PMR446 radios due to using different frequency ranges.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{have been}} {{investigating}} point-to-multipoint wireless communication {{suitable for the}} use inside Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipments to accommodate demands for weight saving, environmental lifecycle CO 2 reduction and improvement of assembly/maintenance efficiency by means of replacing communication wire harnesses with wireless technology, that is wireless harness. Through the radio propagation measurements inside four equipments of automatic teller machine (ATM), ticket vendor, vending machine, and printer, a consistent specification applicable to them has been determined. Based on this specification, a test wireless system has been developed. It showed a good performance even inside the ATM that has the most lossy environment among the four equipments we tested.
