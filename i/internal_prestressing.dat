5000|$|First {{used in the}} late-nineteenth century, {{prestressed}} concrete has developed beyond pre-tensioning to include post-tensioning, which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand, where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or multi-strand, where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously. Tendons may be located either within the concrete volume (<b>internal</b> <b>prestressing),</b> or wholly outside of it (external prestressing). Whereas pre-tensioned concrete by definition uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either bonded or unbonded tendons.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} to highlight key differences in the required amounts of prestressing and passive reinforcement for externally and internally prestressed box-girder bridges. The reinforcement is designed on the basis of combined serviceability and structural safety criteria for varying span length and girder slenderness. Under the assumptions of the study, the externally prestressed box-girder is shown to require up to 25 % more prestressing force for girder heights around 2 m. At girder heights above 3. 5 m however, <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> becomes the more favorable type of prestressing. The study also shows that the externally prestressed girder tends to require more longitudinal and shear passive reinforcement in key design sections. 1...|$|E
40|$|The axial {{behaviour}} {{and design}} of hot-finished high strength steel tubular elements with <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> cables, representing the chord members in prestressed trusses, are examined in this paper. A comprehensive programme of experiments and numerical modelling was performed, the results of which were combined to develop resistance expressions {{for the design of}} prestressed high strength steel members. A total of 12 tensile and 10 compressive member tests were carried out, with the key variables examined being the steel grade (S 460 and S 690), the initial prestress level and the presence of grout. Numerical models were developed to replicate the structural response of the compressive member tests and subsequently used to generate parametric results, where the member slenderness, size of prestressing cable, applied prestress level, steel grade (S 460 or S 690), and grout condition (grouted and non-grouted), were varied. The presence of cables was shown to enhance the tensile capacity of the members, while the addition of prestress resulted in extended elastic range. In compression, the effect of prestress was detrimental, and a modified Perry-Robertson method, developed in [1], was extended to hot-finished high strength steel members...|$|E

40|$|While {{different}} {{design codes}} provide similar guidance for the flexural design of prestressed thin: webbed continuous girders, the shear design provisions differ greatly. This paper investigates these discrepancies {{with the help}} of eleven experiments and a number of analytical studies. Together these provide the basis for recommendations for engineers conducting the shear design for new girders or evaluating the shear capacity of existing girders. It is shown that the traditional ACI approach of taking Vc as the smaller of Vci, flexural:shear cracking load, and Vcw, web:shear cracking load, can significantly overestimate the shear strength of such girders particularly if they are highly prestressed and contain relatively small quantities of shear reinforcement. The other codes evaluated provided more conservative predictions. It is shown that the ACI predictions can be improved significantly by taking into account the effect of flexural stresses on web shear cracking. While the ACI code uses different shear strength equations for members subjected to external axial loads versus members subjected to <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> forces, the studies summarized in this paper support the idea that unification of these ACI shear provisions is possible.

40|$|This {{research}} involves two experimental {{investigations into}} the behaviour of prestressed concrete members strengthened using two typical techniques: the first is by application of external post-tensioning using carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) cables, whereas the second is by bonding composite straps on the tension side of the members. In the first investigation, a total of twelve partially prestressed concrete beams were tested. Nine of the beams were first subjected to loads large enough to cause considerable cracking and deformations and then strengthened with the external CFRP cables and loaded up to failure. The CFRP cables used were CFCC 1 × 7 - 5 mm and 7. 5 mm diameter, manufactured by Tokyo Rope, Japan. The remaining three beams were loaded monotonically from zero up to failure without strengthening and were used as control beams for comparison purposes. The twelve beams had the same concrete cross-section dimensions and were divided into three groups; each group consisted of four beams of the same length but with different levels of <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> The purpose was to {{study the effects of}} the span-to-depth ratio and the partial prestressing ratio or the reinforcing index on the performance of reinforced or prestressed concrete beams after being strengthened with the external CFCC cables...|$|E
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} segmental bridges (PCSBs) {{have been}} the most common design technology used in the last decades. It is widely recognized that segmental bridges have better durability, lower life-cycle costs and higher quality for maintenance than other types of bridges. PCSBs with externally prestressed tendons have become very popular in construction because of economical and safety reasons, fast and practical construction, and outstanding serviceability. Moreover, external tendons technique is widely used because it allows to inspect the cables and to replace them or to reinforce the tendons in case of damage while such kinds of actions are difficult to be taken in case of <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> Therefore, box section is the most common solution due to its aesthetic appeal and elegance that reduces the environmental impact as well due to the convenient maintenance for the tendons. Besides, the hollow concrete box segment can be used for service/electrical cable ducts for bridges. However, there is lack of reliable computational model for analysing behaviour of post-tensioned PCSBs. This research investigates the behaviour of PCSBs with dry keyed joints and external tendons up to failure with the use of finite element method which is validated by comparing experimental results. Deflection, joint opening, tendon slip, stresses of the tendons and the concrete are obtained from numerical analysis with recommendation on further development towards a more accurate numerical model for PCSBs made...|$|E

40|$|Post-tensioned (PT) {{systems have}} been widely used for bridge {{transportation}} systems since the late 1950 s. If a good quality control plan is not implemented, however, there is a strong possibility that during construction the ducts may not be fully grouted. This results in voids in some areas and the associated lack of cover for PT tendons that increase their risk of corrosion. Thus, over the long-term, water can enter the tendon ducts in the void areas, resulting in corrosion of the tendon. The collapse of the Brickton Meadows Foot-bridge in Hampshire, UK, in 1967 is the first serious case of corrosion of tendons leading to a major catas-trophe. 1 In 1985, the collapse of the Ynys-y-Gwas Bridge, a precast segmental PT bridge in Wales, was attributed to the corrosion of the <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> tendons at mortar joints between segments. 1, 2 Corrosion-related failures of PT tendons have been found in several major segmental bridges such as the Niles Channel Bridge near Key West, FL, in 1999 and Midway Bridge near Destin, FL, in 2000. 3 In addition to actual failures, corrosion damage was found in many PT bridge ducts in bridges still in use in Florida and on the East Coast. 4 Impact-Echo (IE) scanning research and consulting results for grout/void in PT ducts are discussed in the following...|$|E

40|$|The {{periodic}} {{assessment of}} our existing concrete infrastructure {{is a crucial}} part of maintaining appropriate levels of public safety over long periods of time. It is important that realistic predictions of the capacity of existing structures can be made in order to avoid unnecessary and expensive intervention work. Assessment is currently undertaken using codified models that are generally readily applied to infrastructure with simple geometric and reinforcement details that conform to design methods for new structures. This approach presents two significant challenges for prestressed structures: 1) design and construction practice has changed significantly in the past 50 years, and modern codified approaches can be incompatible with historic structures; and 2) deterioration of exposed soffits can lead to reduced cover to <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> strand. Unless appropriate reductions are used in assessment of a structure with such problems, unnecessary load restrictions, or major strengthening or reconstruction work may be required, despite having carried a full service load since its construction. There are currently no widely accepted methods for the prediction of peak and residual capacities in prestressed concrete beams with inadequately detailed 7 -wire strand. This paper presents a completely new prediction methodology, validated against new experimental results from 31 novel semi-beam tests. The proposed models for peak load, residual load, and bond stress-slip modelling provide reliable, accurate, and conservative results.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model of a}} prestressed concrete reactor vessel (pCR V) for LMFBR ilnd the associated finite element com-puter code, involving an explicit time integration procedure, is described. The model is axisymmetric and includes simula-tions of the tensile cracking of concrete, the reinforcement, and a prestressing capability. The tensile cracking of concrete and the steel reinforcement are both modeled as continuously distributed within the nnite element. The stresses in the rein-forcement and concrete are computed separately and combined to give an overall stress state of the composite material. The reinformcement {{is assumed to be}} elastic, perfectly-plastic; the concrete is taken to be elastic, with tensile and com-pressive stress limits. Cracking of concrete is based on the criterion of maximum principal stress; a crack is assumed to form normal to the direction of the maximum principal stress. Attention is also given to the tact that cracks do not form instan-taneously, but develop gradually. Thus, after crack initiation the normal stress is reduced to zero gradually as a function of time. Residual shear resi. stance of cracks due to 199 regate interlock is also taken into account. An existing crack is permitted to close. Prestressing of the PCR V is modeled by special structural members which represent an averaged prestressing layer equivalent to an axisymmetric shell. The <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> members are superimposed over the reinforced concrete body of the PCRV; they are permitted to stretch and slide in a predetermined path, simulating the actual tendons.

40|$|In current {{engineering}} practice, safety {{checks on}} serviceability and determinations of {{ultimate limit states}} of segmental bridges built by cantilevering are generally performed, either considering separately the contributions of axial force N, bending moment M, and shear force V, or considering the interaction effects through approximate expressions supplied by building codes. During construction stages and service life, the interaction between internal forces can be of fundamental importance in establishing the actual degree of structural safety and, for this reason, a different philosophy for performing checks in segmental bridges is proposed in this paper, plotting N-M and M-V interaction domains for cracking, construction stages, and serviceability (elastic domains) as well as M-V interaction domains for ultimate limit states (failure domains). Delayed deformations {{as a result of}} creep are considered, as are bonded and unbonded prestressing. A model is developed for plotting bending-shear domains at the ultimate limit state, underlining the strength reduction that occurs in concrete sections with external prestressing versus beams with full <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> A numerical application on an actual segmental bridge built by cantilevering was performed to show the proposed methodology, based entirely on strength domains, for safety checks. The load and stress paths in the construction stages are highlighted by considering the effects of creep in concrete, whereas bending-shear interaction is evaluated in the two cases of fully bonded prestressing and partially unbonded prestressing. The results show that safety checks which are performed based on approximate assumptions and expressions that do not explicitly consider the interaction effects can lead to unsafe evaluations, and it also shows that the proposed methodology allows engineers to take into account simultaneously any aspect related to cross-sectional strength on serviceability and ultimate limit states...|$|E

The effectiveness of the FRP techniques have been clearly confirmed by numerous experimental and field applications. This study focuses on the possible use of basalt fibres for FRP rebars or laminates. Basalt is a volcanic igneous rock that because of its high performance in terms of strength, corrosion resistance, temperature range, fire resistance and durability as well as lower potential, cost may effectively replace steel, glass and carbon fibres in many applications. The paper discusses, based on a literature review and some feasibility tests, the possible use of basalt fibres in relation to reinforcing and strengthening of concrete. Herewith, reference is made to (1) basalt fibre composite bars or rods for internal reinforcement, (2) the possibility to use short basalt fibres, and (3) strengthening of concrete members by means of externally bonded reinforcement (EBR), near surface mounted reinforcement (NSM) or textile reinforced mortar reinforcement (TRM).

40|$|Many bridges in {{the world}} are {{classified}} as deficient and in need of rehabilitation or replacement. Some of them are deficient because their load-carrying capacity is inadequate for today's increased traffic load. To improve their efficiency and increase their load capacity, several methods can be used, {{one of them is the}} external prestressing. Also, to avoid corrosion problem that faced this type of strengthening, Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) can be used instead of steel tendons. Within the different types of FRP, Parafil rope was established to be well suited for prestressing system, combining the benefits of light-weight, high strength, easy handling and efficient anchorage system. Thirteen prestressed beams,one with <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> steel only, and the rest strengthened externally using Parafil Ropes Type G were tested up to failure under two third point loading. Six factors were studied to investigate their effect on the behaviour of strengthened beams. These factors are the value of the external prestressing force and its eccentricity, deviator position, previous loading stage before strengthening, concrete strength and (span/depth) ratio. Also, analytical investigations were conducted to propose simple equations could be used in the analysis of this beam type, regarding its deflection and flexural strength with an acceptable accuracy. The study indicated that, external prestressing using Parafil rope is a very powerful system for strengthening or rehabilitation of prestressed concrete structures. Also, providing external prestressing force by a moderate amount improves the stiffness, and both cracking and ultimate flexural strength of prestressed concrete beams without significant reduction in ductility even for cracked beams. The modifications made to the methods used to calculate deflection and ultimate moment of bonded prestressed concrete, generalised these methods so, they can be used with beams have different types of prestressing tendons (bonded, internal unbonded, external unbonded or mixture of them). These methods, after modification, were found to give fairly accurate results. Also, the novel equation described the relation between the increase in the external prestressing force and the deflection makes the analysis of the externally strengthened beams under service loads,less complicated with a reasonable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of concrete bridges {{has been a}} major concern for structural engineers especially with regard to deterioration caused by the corrosion of steel reinforcement. One of the promising avenues to overcome this problem is {{to take advantage of the}} non corrosive characteristic of the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars in reinforcing and/or prestressing concrete bridges. In addition FRP bars have high specific strength, i. e., strength to weight ratio, when compared to conventional steel. Using FRP bars in a combined system of <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> and external post-tensioning provides a potential solution to increase the service life of concrete bridges. However, due to the difference in the mechanical properties between FRP tendons and steel, the flexural behavior of beams prestressed and post-tensioned with internally bonded and externally unbonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons is different when compared with the behavior of beams prestressed with conventional steel bars and/or tendons. Also, as these beams can be post-tensioned with unbonded tendons the deflection of the whole system becomes a controlling parameter in the analysis. An analytical model has been developed to examine the behavior of beams prestressed and post-tensioned with CFRP tendons. First, finite element analysis has been carried out to calibrate the tension stiffening characteristic of concrete in order to take into consideration the difference in the bond behavior between CFRP tendons and steel for beams prestressed with bonded tendons. The calibrated tension stiffening is used in the analytical model for the proper modeling of the cross-section curvatures and deflection calculations. Three analytical approaches that account for the tension stiffening of concrete in indirect approaches were also applied to examine the change in the post-tensioning force and were compared with the analytical model. These approaches use the ACI 440. 4 R- 04 committee recommendation, ISIS equation and CEIB-FIP code approach to evaluate the effective moment of inertia used in beam deflection. Furthermore, results from two experimental programs were used to validate the proposed analysis. The first experimental program tested a full scale Double-Tee beam (DT-beam) prestressed and post-tensioned with CFRP tendons, and was conducted at Construction Technology Laboratories, Skokie, Illinois. This beam is a replica of the beams used in the superstructure of the 2 ̆ 2 Bridge Street Bridge 2 ̆ 2 constructed over the Rouge River in Southfield, Michigan, USA. The second experimental program was conducted at Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, Michigan, USA for box beams prestressed with internally bonded and externally unbonded CFRP tendons to examine the behavior of these beams.

40|$|The {{construction}} of both medium and long span precast concrete segmental bridges is widely spread throughout Spain. Usually, the segments have multiple-keyed epoxy joints, and are assembled by <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing.</b> Yet, {{there is a}} more recent type of bridge with dry joints and external prestressing. In these last ones, shear is transferred through physical support between keys and friction between faces of the compressed joint. This shear force is evaluated using friction coefficients from tests, where joints were subjected to service compressive stresses. However, normal stresses at ultimate limit state can reach much higher values. Hence, the friction coefficient used currently to design segmental concrete bridges is an extrapolation of the experimental values. It is assumed that the value advocated is the same for any normal stress level and any concrete type, although the roughness of their flat surfaces is different in each case. Nowadays, the absence of friction data for both segments made out of ultra-high strength and self-consolidating concrete, and the very few tests performed on high strength concrete, complicate the innovation of precast segmental bridges. The optimization of their design and construction is also affected by the lack of standards for mix designing ultra-high strength concrete with local materials, and for quantifying formwork pressure due to self-consolidating concrete. This doctoral thesis presents a simple experimental method for measuring friction coefficient between precast segments based on push-off tests. Flat dry joints of six concrete types (conventional, self-consolidating, high strength, high strength self-consolidating, high strength fibre reinforced, and ultra-high strength concrete) were tested under two confining pressure levels. The combination of both parameters provided friction values for conventional and high performance concrete subjected to normal stresses of around 50 and 100 % of the ones registered at ultimate limit state. All concrete tested were made with local materials. For this reason, this work also provides a mix design procedure to achieve ultra-high performance concrete with compressive strength above 150 MPa at industrial production. It consisted of the modification of the mix proportions according to the results obtained after applying the trial-and-error techniques at distinct scales. The possibility of using self-consolidating segments in this bridge type led to analyse the influence of the mix design on the evolution of formwork pressure. This doctoral thesis contributes to understand better which materials can achieve a balance between superior fresh properties of self-consolidating concrete and low lateral pressure build-up. Five typical precast self-consolidating mixes were subjected to slump flow, rheological and thixotropic tests. As a result, slump flow diameter, spreading rate, yield stress, plastic viscosity, and rate of structural rebuilding (stress relaxation) were measured. The correlations made between these different parameters allowed estimating the implication of water content, nanoclays and viscosity-modifying admixtures on the development of lateral pressure and its rate of pressure drop. The results of each test were compared with standards and recommendations and other research for corroborating the data and information used so far, for determining their structural safety, and for improving and completing current design codes. From the points of view of cost, time and safety, all this research contributes to promote the use of high performance concrete, and to optimize the design and the {{construction of}} segmental bridges, especially precast viaducts built span-by-span...|$|E

A general method for solving linear creep problems is known so far only for the time-invariant creep law {{and is based on}} the elastic-viscoelastic analogy {{and the use of the}} Laplace transform. For a transient creep law, e. g. for polymers at variable temperature or for aging concrete, no general method, to the author's knowledge, has been presented. In this paper, in agreement with the tendency of modern applied mathematics towards convergent numerical algorithms for computers rather than to analytical methods, general numerical integration procedures in time will be presented. Particularly for concrete creep (eq. 9 b) they were derived by the autho...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} how {{mechanical stresses}} that {{are applied to}} the whole organism are transmitted to individual cells and transduced into a biochemical response. DESIGN: In this article, we describe fundamental design principles {{that are used to}} stabilize the musculoskeletal system at many different size scales and show that these design features are embodied in one particular form of architecture that is known as tensegrity. RESULTS: Tensegrity structures are characterized by use of continuous tension and local compression; architecture, <b>prestress</b> (<b>internal</b> stress prior to application of external force), and triangulation play the most critical roles in terms of determining their mechanical stability. In living organisms, use of a hierarchy of tensegrity networks both optimizes structural efficiency and provides a mechanism to mechanically couple the parts with the whole: mechanical stresses applied at the macroscale result in structural rearrangements at the cell and molecular level. CONCLUSION: Due to use of tensegrity architecture, mechanical stress is concentrated and focused on signal transducing molecules that physically associate with cell surface molecules that anchor cells to extracellular matrix, such as integrins, and with load-bearing elements within the internal cytoskeleton and nucleus. Mechanochemical transduction may then proceed through local stress-dependent changes in molecular mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics within the cell. In this manner, the entire cellular response to stress may be orchestrated and tuned by altering the prestress in the cell, just as changing muscular tone can alter mechanical stability and structural coordination throughout the whole musculoskeletal system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to use {{numerical}} modelling to evaluate practical guidelines for soil and large diameter rigid pipe interaction problems. A detailed critique is also given on current design methods, followed by {{an explanation of the}} alternative general criteria for field performance. Conventional design methods are generally based on Marston-Spangler theory developed for small diameter concrete non-prestressed pipe in the 1920 's, which take no account of the actual material properties, true geometry and field construction procedure. Numerical analyses have been performed using the geotechnical finite element package CRISP, together with data from full scale site installation trials and three-edge bearing load tests. Practical guidance is given for various construction conditions. A brief summary of the main factors influencing the behaviour of buried rigid pipe are: the elastic properties of both the pipe and the surrounding soil, the placement, compaction, and any subsequent volumetric changes in the soils placed around the pipe, the variation of earth cover, geometry and bedding conditions, the weight of water, <b>internal</b> pressures, and <b>prestressing</b> effects from helically-wound steel wires. From this study, {{it was found that the}} <b>prestressing</b> and <b>internal</b> water pressures significantly affect the behaviour of buried pipe, leading to the change of bending stresses in the pipe wall. The improvement of construction techniques is also very important in terms of bedding condition and compaction of side fill, etc. In conclusion, current design practice is highly deficient, causing very uneconomical designs for buried large diameter rigid pipe. The finite element method has provided useful insights into an important practical engineering problem, and has indicated the critical design factor for large diameter buried rigid pipe...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been observed}} {{during the last two}} decades in the field of seismic engineering with further refinements of performance-based seismic design philosophies and the subsequent definition of corresponding compliance criteria. Following the globally recognized expectation and ideal aim to provide a modern society with high (seismic) performance structures able to sustain a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, alternative solutions have been developed for high-performance, seismic resisting systems. In the last two decades, an alternative approach in seismic design has been introduced for precast concrete buildings in seismic regions with the introduction of “dry” jointed ductile systems also called “hybrid” systems based on unbonded post-tensioned rocking connections. As a result structural systems with high seismic performance capabilities can be implemented, with the unique capability to undergo inelastic displacement similar to their traditional monolithic counterparts, while limiting the damage to the structural system and assuring full re-centring capabilities (negligible residual or permanent deformations). The continuous and rapid development of jointed ductile connections for seismic resisting systems has resulted in the validation {{of a wide range of}} alternative arrangements, encompassed under the general umbrella of “hybrid” systems. This research provides a comprehensive experimental and analytical investigations of 2 - and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints subjected both uni and bi-directional (four clove) quasic-static loading protocols into the behaviour, modelling, design and feasibility of new arrangements for “dry” jointed ductile systems for use in regions of high seismicity. In order to further emphasize the enhanced performance of these systems, a comparison with the experimental response and observed damage of 2 -D and 3 -D monolithic beam-column benchmark specimens is presented. However, after a lot of attention given to the behaviour of the skeleton structure, more recently the focus of research in Earthquake Engineering has concentrated on the behaviour of the floor system within the overall 3 D behaviour of the building and the effects of beam elongation. The effects of beam elongation in precast frame systems have been demonstrated to be a potential source of un-expected damage, unless adequate detailing is provided in order to account for displacement incompatibilities between the lateral resisting systems and the floor. Two contributions to beam elongation are typically recognized: a) the material contribution due to the cumulative residual strain within the steel, and b) the geometrical contribution due to the presence of a neutral axis and actual depth of the beam. Regarding jointed ductile connections with re-centering characteristics, the extent of beam elongation is significantly reduced, being limited to solely the geometrical contribution. Furthermore, such effects could be minimized when a reduced depth of the beam is adopted due to the use of <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> or external post-tensioning. However, damage to precast floor systems, resulting from a geometric elongation of the beam, has yet to be addressed in detail. In order to emphasize the enhanced performance in controlling and minimizing the damage of the structural elements via the use of the proposed advanced hybrid solutions, this research presents via experimental and analytical validation of two alternative and innovative solutions to reduce the damage to the floor using 2 and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints. The first approach consists of using standard precast rocking/dissipative frame connections (herein referred to as “gapping”) in combination with an articulated or “jointed” floor. This system uses mechanical devices to connect the floor and the lateral beams which can accommodate the displacement incompatibilities in the connection. The second approach to reduce the floor damage investigates the implementation of a “non-gapping” connection, also called non-tearing-floor connection, using a top hinge at the beam-column interface, while still relying on more traditional floor-to-frame connections (i. e. topping and continuous starter bars). Additionally, further refinements and constructability issues for the non gapping connection are investigated under the experimental and analytical validation of a major 2 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, two-story one-bay frame using non-tearing floor connections. Based on the non-tearing floor connections, a series of parametric analysis for beam-column joints and frames are carried out. Furthermore, the analysis and design of two prototype frames using different solutions is presented. The frames are subjected to cyclic adaptive pushover and inelastic time history analysis in order to investigate analytically the response characteristics of hybrid frames using non-tearing connections, as well as how the beam growth affects the frame response under earthquake loading. Computational models for hybrid PRESSS frames and a conventional reinforced concrete frames are developed and compared with the ones using non-tearing connections...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} {{principles of}} "Timber-Glass-Composite-Girders" demand practical and theoretical research to ensure reliable designs. Toward this objective the mathematical description of load-bearing and the non-rigid bond {{is the subject}} of this work, i. e. to define the contributing parameters for the design of these girders. The non-rigid-bond of the adhesive joint is of great importance because of its influence on the load-bearing of the system as a whole. The loading of girders is dominated by permanent forces thus leading to the obligation of knowing the long-term behaviour of the system and its components. The definition of the characteristic values, taking into account the long-term load-bearing, is an intrinsic part of this investigation. It can be shown that the load-bearing of the girders depends on the fracture of the glass panes. The properties of glass-fractures are a function of the residual internal prestresses due to the heat-strengthening of the panes. The load-bearing, particularly the post-cracked behaviour, changes with respect to the intensity of these internal prestresses. The timber is able to reinforce the cracked glass, leading to a ductile load-bearing behaviour as in the girders, with a dependency upon the size of the remaining fractures. A model based on the differential equations of the non-rigid bond is defined in order to calculate the loading-peaks of the adhesive joint and the material loading itself. The characteristic values of the non-rigid bond, such as the number and distances between cracks and the load introducing length, were evaluated in tests on composite slabs and small scale girders. The existing calculation models which take into account non-rigid bonding were modified to adapt the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. In order to calculate the stressing of the material the existing calculation models were adapted to calculate the post-cracked situation. The load-bearing behaviour of glass-panes bent with respect to its strong neutral axis needs other safety-considerations than panes, bent off their plane. It is shown that the existing safety considerations subject to the use of glass can not easily be adapted onto the composite girders. The bending with respect to the strong neutral axis and the reinforcement of the glass of the timber demands a different hypothesis to adapt the fractural mechanical analysis and to establish a safe limit conception. This is part of the performed research of this document. The following descriptions present briefly the obtained results: Depending on the quality of the glass (residual stresses due to heat-strengthening, e. g. annealed glass, heat-strengthened glass, fully tempered glass), the ductility and the mode of failure of the girders does change. As a result of its failure mode, annealed glass without internal prestresses offers the highest remaining load-carrying potential after the first crack has appeared. This ductility and thus the structural safety, diminishes with an increasing degree of <b>internal</b> <b>prestressing</b> due to thermal treatment. Heat-strengthened glass (with various degrees of prestressing, various residual stresses) shows a decrease in remaining load-carrying capacity with an increasing degree of prestressing until it fails in a brittle mode as fully toughened glass does. This has to be well considered in respect to safety considerations. Girders with panes made of glass having internal residual stresses due to heat strengthening below 50 N/mm 2 are considered to collapse ductily, residual stresses bigger than 50 N/mm 2 cause brittle failure. The effective stiffness of the girders decreases under permanent loads in function of the bondage. Both, timber and adhesive take part in this decrease; the influence of both of the involved materials has been defined. Since the design of conventional glass constructions which uses the concept of principle stresses cannot be adapted, unidirectional shear stresses had to be determined for the shear strength of glass, which is defined as 25 N/mm 2 for annealed glass. The characteristic values of the adhesive to define the non-rigid bonds have been determined, likewise the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. The load introducing length, the distances between cracks and the number of cracks are defined with tests on composite slabs. A model to describe the theoretical bond with the defined parameters based on the differential equations was developed. This model allows the calculation of the material stressing at the load introduction and on both sides of a crack. To calculate the stressing of glass and timber existing calculation models which take into account non-rigid bonding were modified to adapt the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. In order to calculate the stressing of the material the existing calculation models were adapted to calculate the post-cracked situation. The safety factors for the influences of the glass surface, environmental conditions, load duration and the parameters of fracture mechanical analysis as developed as they are known for semi-probabilistic safety concepts for glass constructions cannot easily be adopted. The bending with respect to the strong neutral axis demands a different hypothesis in order to adapt the fractural mechanical analysis and to develop the safety parameters. For the reliable design of timber-glass-composite-girders a contribution to the appropriate use of probabilistic, semi-probabilistic and deterministic safety concepts are given. A realised construction (Hotel "Palafitte" in Monruz (NE)) shows an example and the experience made in designing girders...|$|E
