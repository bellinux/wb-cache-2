Two {{important}} {{parameters of}} torispherical head that are i R (<b>interior</b> <b>radius</b> of spherical crown area) and r (<b>interior</b> <b>radius</b> of transition corner) have been optimized by the module {{of the large}} general-purpose finite-element software ANSYS, targeting the strength and stability of the head. This paper provides an optimized torispherical head, which improves {{the stability of the}} edge of the head with acceptable strength of the head. The procedure is generally applicable as a design tool for optimal design. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} means of {{determining}} the spin of an astrophysical black hole is by actually measuring the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> of a surrounding accretion disk and using that to infer the spin. By comparing {{a number of different}} estimates of the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> from simulations of tilted accretion disks with differing black-hole spins, we show that such a procedure can give quite wrong answers. Over the range 0 <= a/M <= 0. 9, we find that, for moderately thick disks (H/r ~ 0. 2) with modest tilt (15 degrees), the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> is nearly independent of spin. This result is likely dependent on tilt, such that for larger tilts, it may even be that the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> would increase with increasing spin. In the opposite limit, we confirm through numerical simulations of untilted disks that, in the limit of zero tilt, the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> recovers approximately the expected dependence on spin.

The observation was taken using the burst mode and only suffered mild pile-up effects. A broad iron line is clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. We test different models and find that the iron line is asymmetric and best interpreted by relativistic reflection. The relativistically broadened iron line is generally believed to originate from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, where strong gravity causes a series of special and general relativistic effects. The iron line profile indicates an <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> of approx. 8 R(sub G), which gives an upper limit {{on the size of}} the NS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the elastic-plastic stress {{analysis}} of a thin thermoplastic composite disc under internal pressures. An analytical solution is performed for satisfying elastic-plastic stress–strain relations and boundary conditions for small plastic deformations. Because of the material properties, the composite disc {{is assumed to be}} elastic-perfectly plastic, and the Tsai–Hill Criterion is used as a yield criterion. Elastic-plastic and residual stress distributions are obtained from the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> to the outer radius, and they are presented in tables and figures. All radial stresses r are compressive, and they are highest {{at the point where the}} plastic deformation begins. All tangential stresses are tensile, and they are highest at the <b>inner</b> <b>radius.</b> The magnitude of tangential residual stresses is higher than that of the radial residual stresses, and it changes nonlinearly from the <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> to the outer radius.

40|$|The disk {{instability}} {{model can}} explain the previous history of dwarf-nova-like outbursts in the intermediate polar GK Per, which occur about once every three years. Disk models that reproduce the recurrence time and outburst light curves suggest that GK Per has a large effective <b>inner</b> disk <b>radius</b> (approx. 30 - 40 white dwarf radii) truncated by a strong magnetic field (10 (exp 7) G). In this context, the effective radius {{is that of the}} portion of the disk that participates in the disk thermal instability. The radius derived is larger than the corotation radius, which must be an upper limit on the true dynamical <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> of the disk. Disk instability models with this large effective <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> predict that the ultraviolet continuum should be rather flat. Here we compare the predictions of the disk instability model to IUE observations of the 1981 outburst and to IUE and ROSAT observations of the recent 1992 outburst of GK Per. The model disk continuum spectral evolution is consistent with the observed UV and optical spectra, especially at maximum and in the early decay phase of the outburst. The consistency of the model with the observed UV spectra suggests that the effective <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> of the disk is almost constant, independent of mass accretion rate, and that whatever structure lies between the effective <b>inner</b> <b>radius</b> and the corotation radius neither participates in the disk instability nor radiates substantially in the UV.
