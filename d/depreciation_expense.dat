To their credit, Miami-Dade Transit {{has not been an}} accountable organization, coming on the brink of shut-down in 2011, when they were audited by the federal government. On the other hand, the many tolled highways in Florida, for example, generate a significant amount of money for the state, whereas like many mass transit systems in the US, systems such as Metrorail and Metromover have always been a significant loss, financially speaking. Even some of the highway toll collection operations in Florida are privatized. Miami-Dade Transit's federal investigation, which included criminal investigation in addition to audits, revealed likely fraud among other wasteful spending; service cuts and a shut down of the AirportLink project nearly resulted. Tri-Rail is considered an exceptional loss; for fiscal year 2010, train revenue was approximately US$10.3 million, while total operating expenses for fiscal year 2010, including <b>depreciation</b> <b>expense,</b> were approximately US$86.9 million.

50|$|Depreciation is {{a method}} of reallocating {{the cost of a}} {{tangible}} asset over its useful life span of it being in motion. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both tax and accounting purposes.The former affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the latter affects the net income that they report. Generally the cost is allocated, as <b>depreciation</b> <b>expense,</b> among the periods in which the asset is expected to be used. This expense is recognized by businesses for financial reporting and tax purposes. Methods of computing depreciation, and the periods over which assets are depreciated, may vary between asset types within the same business and may vary for tax purposes. These may be specified by law or accounting standards, which may vary by country. There are several standard methods of computing <b>depreciation</b> <b>expense,</b> including fixed percentage, straight line, and declining balance methods. <b>Depreciation</b> <b>expense</b> generally begins when the asset is placed in service. For example, a <b>depreciation</b> <b>expense</b> of 100 per year for five years may be recognized for an asset costing 500.|$|E

The annual reports of all 177 local government councils in NSW were analysed revealing a high level of compliance with the standard.

In addition a number of problems were identified, in particular the timeliness of the reports and the disproportionately high levels of <b>depreciation</b> <b>expenses</b> reported in the operating statement. The increased complexities of the financial management in Local Government imposed by AAS 27 required professional accounting competencies more appropriately derived from a degree level education which contributed to a high turnover of accounting staff during the four years.

As an outcome of that discussion, it is now generally recognized that inflation affects the estimation of income and taxes using conventional accounting procedures in at least five different ways. First, <b>depreciation</b> <b>expenses</b> or capital cost allowances become underestimated because they are usually calculated as a fraction of the historical cost of fixed assets, not their current inflated values. Second, the cost of goods sold tend to be underestimated, and income over-estimated, if goods used from inventories are valued on a first in first out basis rather than at their current (adjusted for inflation) costs. Third, nominal interest rates tend to rise due to the compensation required by lenders for the decrease in the real value of the principal outstanding due to inflation. This tends to create a significant immediate increase in the cash outflow of the business relative to the increase in cash inflow due to inflation. inflation, tax accounting, Indonesia...|$|R
