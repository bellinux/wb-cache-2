2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "CEO confidence—that look {{in their}} eyes, {{their view of}} the animal spirits—appears to be back in {{stronger}} measure than I at least have heard in some time. What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the answer, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her acquaintances would give, if {{they were}} asked the same {{question}} and replied honestly," [...] said the young girl, as if musing.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is very {{different}} now,' said Lord Martindale. Four years ago I could hardly have wished it. Now, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> highly <b>of</b> him, and I should have been rejoiced to have seen his constancy rewarded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I don't {{know that}} I can {{say much about}} that. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them was overfond of the Miss Penfolds, and wouldn't have been sorry if the will had been found {{that would have given}} them another master or mistress." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We had two killed, {{as we came}} down," [...] he said, [...] "and {{two others}} wounded. I believe one has fallen here, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us are wounded with knife thrusts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{can take}} care of myself pretty well, miss, and I am not alone. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the men here are of the same opinion, and will be glad to see the camp freed of these ruffians.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the diving-stations!" [...] I commanded, and in {{less than}} a minute the deck was deserted, the conning-tower covers had slammed to and the U-33 was submerging--possibly for the last time. I know that I had this feeling, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the others did.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the actors}} bonded with the {{soldiers}} who trained them for their roles. Actor Tom Sizemore said, [...] "What really got me at training camp was the Ranger Creed. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us can understand that kind of mutual devotion. It's like having 200 best friends and {{every single one of}} them would die for you".|$|R
3000|$|... “Not {{only are}} the people here poor but we also {{experience}} inconsistent power supply in this area which is very rampant. These affect <b>most</b> <b>of</b> our small business operators here. But <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the business owners {{do not have any}} skills in the area. Also, because they are not properly educated they are not able to manage their businesses properly”-Queen mother of Agomenya-Yokuenor (Field survey, 2015) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't often," [...] the Bishop reflected, [...] "that I {{have the}} chance of a few minutes' quiet conversation, on the day before her wedding, with the woman whom I am going to marry to the man <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> on earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For myself certainly," [...] said Lyle. [...] "How far {{the rest}} {{agree with me}} will be seen if we appeal to them as an {{assembly}} with power to decide, which, unless {{we are forced to}} it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us should sooner avoid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have only}} had {{thirteen}} killed outright," [...] he said. [...] "Twelve more are very seriously wounded, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them will recover. As {{to the rest}} of the company, I fancy that most of them will require some bandaging. And now I shall recommend you and your daughter to return to your shelter. I have no fear whatever of their coming back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just traveling. I'm glad we're going together, Mr. Morton. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these cattlemen {{are very}} nice. Except {{for the old}} Jews. They seem to be fine old coots. They make you think of--oh--you know--prophets and stuff. Watch 'em, over there, making tea. I suppose the steamer grub ain't kosher. I seen one on the Joy Line saying his prayers--I suppose he was--in a kind of shawl." ...|$|R
60|$|This, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the news}} I got from my friend Loudon; and I hope I was well inspired, and have {{put all the}} {{questions}} to which you would be curious to hear an answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "As regards Julia, I do {{not know}} whether it may not be for the best. It seems to be a cruel thing to say, but of course <b>I</b> cannot but <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> her. You have heard, perhaps, that they have not been happy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they didn't like it much, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{them had}} a respect for him. I know I did. He has {{a whole lot of}} assurance, an air of knowing what he's talking about, and {{apparently}} he doesn't give a continental whether he's popular or not. Besides, Greenhalge had cracked him up to the skies for the work he'd done for the school board." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us {{will agree}} {{when we look}} back that the most real thing in our college life was not the lecturing and the lessons--very much of that stuff could very well {{have been done in}} the {{schooling}} stage--but the arguments of the debating society, the discussions that broke out in the classroom or laboratory, the talks in one's rooms about God and religion, about the state and freedom, about art, about every possible and impossible social relationship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the pigeons}} are getting scarcer too, Bertie. We have killed a good many, {{but the rest}} are getting very shy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them must have gone off and settled in new places {{on the face of}} the rocks above the ravine. While Dias is away, we will try and lay in a stock of sea-fish. We can swim out and sit on the rocks during the day, and lay our lines at night. We have worked very hard for a fortnight, and we deserve a holiday." ...|$|E
60|$|These, if {{they are}} not all, are at least (as <b>I</b> <b>think)</b> the <b>most</b> {{considerable}} <b>of</b> those simple ideas which the mind has, out of which is made all its other knowledge; all which it receives only by the two forementioned ways of sensation and reflection.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{grows out}} of feeling torn between {{conflicting}} goals or obligations. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> teachers <b>of</b> first year college writing courses also feel this conflict, and I experience it acutely as director of a university writing program. On the one hand, I feel an obligation not to force all my students {{to conform to the}} language and culture of mainstream English. (See “The Students’ Right To Their Own Language” [Committee].) On the other hand, I feel an obligation to give all my students access to the written language of power and prestige...|$|R
60|$|McGann, I understand, is dead. I am {{not sorry}} for it. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us {{the time has}} gone by when {{we can see the}} fun of putting tacks on chairs, or thistles in beds, or live snakes in people's boots.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget how I first became acquainted with Rectus. About {{a couple of}} years before, he was a new boy in the academy at Willisville. One Saturday, a lot of us went down to the river to swim. Our {{favorite}} place was near an old wharf, which ran out into deep water, and a fellow could take a good dive there, when the tide was high. There were some of the smaller boys along that day, but they didn't dive any, and if they even swam, it was in shallow water near the shore, {{by the side of the}} wharf. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them spent their time wading about.|$|E
6000|$|But on {{the side}} of those who fought for Ibsen there was also a disagreement, and perhaps also a mistake. The vague army of [...] "the advanced" [...] (an army which {{advances}} in all directions) were united in feeling that they ought to be the friends of Ibsen because he also was advancing somewhere somehow. But they were also seriously impressed by Flaubert, by Oscar Wilde and all the rest who told them that a work of art was in another universe from ethics and social good. Therefore many, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most,</b> <b>of</b> the Ibsenites praised the Ibsen plays merely as choses vues, æsthetic affirmations of what can be without any reference to what ought to be. Mr. William Archer himself inclined to this view, though his strong sagacity kept him in a haze of healthy doubt on the subject. Mr. Walkley certainly took this view. But this view Mr. George Bernard Shaw abruptly and violently refused to take.|$|E
60|$|All {{this is by}} the way, to {{show that}} my apology for Mordax was not founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the {{compatibility}} of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our acts immediately (not distantly) concern. Will any one be so hardy as to maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us have some interest in arguing the contrary. And it is {{of the nature of}} vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and self-justifying. There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them, and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason. This is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain the outleap of roar and talons.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby {{showed a}} trace of disconcertion. “I {{do not know why}} he told you, but as <b>I</b> shall, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> my life in America it could do me little good to vindicate myself,” he said. “Only a few people know the truth, and they will keep my confidence, while the rest would not believe it. Tony made {{reparation}} for the wrong he did me, and if he had not risked the cazador’s bayonet <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should be here now.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{issue in}} the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid {{disclosing}} information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, [...] "Will historians know more later?", Kimmel replied, [...] "' ... I'll tell you what <b>I</b> believe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.' ..." [...] From Vice Admiral Libby, [...] "I will go to my grave convinced that FDR ordered Pearl Harbor to let happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, Master Leigh," [...] Rouget said. [...] "It {{might be}} managed in that way. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> our chaps {{had better be}} told off for firing the town. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that a good many {{might be willing to}} {{undertake}} that job, for I have heard it said, many and many a time, {{that they would like to}} burn the sewer rats out. There are other men who would, I am sure, rather join in the attack on the jail, if they could do so without putting the lives of all of us in danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jaqui {{was utterly}} astounded {{by what he}} heard. His mind was {{suddenly}} permeated by a conviction which rendered him speechless. He rose, and without another word he hurried home. As {{soon as he could}} he made a visit to Donna Paltravi. He had not seen her for a week or more, and the moment his eyes fell upon her he saw that Florino was right. She was growing old! He spent some time with her, but as she did not allude to any change in herself, of course he did not; but just as he was leaving he made a casual remark about Florino. 'Oh, he has not been here for some time,' said the lady. 'I missed him at first, but now I am glad he does not come. He is very frivolous, and I have a small opinion of his poetry. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it is copied, and he shows poor judgment in his selections.' ...|$|E
60|$|December 3.--A day of petty business, {{which killed}} a holiday. Finished my {{tale of the}} Mirror;[85] went with Tom Allan to see his {{building}} at Lauriston, where he has displayed good taste--supporting instead of tearing down or destroying the old chateau, which once belonged to the famous Mississippi Law. The additions are in very good taste, and will make a most comfortable house. Mr. Burn, architect, would fain have had the old house pulled down, which I wonder at in him,[86] though {{it would have been}} the practice of most of his brethren. When I came up to town I was just in time for the Bannatyne Club, where things are going on reasonably well. I hope we may get out some good historical documents in the course of the winter. Dined at the Royal Society Club. At the society had some essays upon the specific weight of the ore of manganese, which was caviare to the President, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the members. But it seemed extremely accurate, and I have little doubt was intelligible to those who had the requisite key. We supped at Mr. Russell's, where the conversation was as gay as usual. Lieut-Col. Ferguson was my guest at the dinner.|$|E
60|$|It {{was safe}} enough, perhaps, on the raft, {{but it was}} not in the least comfortable. We were all crowded together, {{crouching}} on the canvas, and the water just swashed about us as if we were floating boards. We went {{up and down on the}} waves with a motion that wouldn't have been so bad had we not thought we might be shuffled off, if a big wave turned us over a little too much. But there were lots of things to hold on to, and we all stuck close together. We three were in the middle. The captain told us to get there. There is no way of telling how glad I was that the captain was with us. I was well satisfied, anyway, to be with the party on the raft. I might have liked it better in a boat, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the men in the boats were waiters, or stewards, or passengers--fellows who were in a hurry to get off. The officers and sailors who remained behind to do their best for the ship and the passengers were the men on the raft; and these I felt we could trust. I think there were ten of them, besides the captain, making fourteen of us in all.|$|E

The man hadn't any {{authority}} {{to deal with the}} birds, and nothing on earth would induce him to sell; but it seems he told Padishah that a Eurasian named Potter had already made him an offer, and on that Padishah denounced Potter before us all. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us thought it rather smart of Potter, and I know that when Potter said that he'd wired at Aden to London to buy the birds, and would have an answer at Suez, I cursed pretty richly at a lost opportunity.|$|R
