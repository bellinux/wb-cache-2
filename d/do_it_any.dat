500|$|The 20-year-old, Bayne, {{appeared}} in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of his Sprint Cup Series career, {{in front of}} a crowd of 182,000people. [...] Also by winning the race, he became the youngest winner of the Daytona 500 at 20years and one day. Jeff Gordon previously held the title at 25years old. The race was Bayne's second Sprint Cup Series start, and became the Wood Brothers Racing team's fifth Daytona 500 win. He also became the second driver to win the race in his first attempt, with the other begin Lee Petty who won the 1959 Daytona 500, which was the inaugural race. With the win coming in his second start in the Sprint Cup Series, Bayne also matched Jamie McMurray for quickest victory {{at the start of a}} career; however, since Bayne was racing for the Nationwide Series points championship, he did not earn any Sprint Cup points for the win. The race victory was the Wood Brothers first win since the 2001 season. Following his win, he described his happiness, [...] "If I tried to put it into words, I couldn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> justice." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

2500|$|War is an {{enduring}} theme of Cohen's work that—in his earlier songs and early life—he approached ambivalently. Challenged in 1974 over his serious demeanor in concerts {{and the military}} salutes he ended them with, Cohen remarked, [...] "I sing serious songs, and I'm serious onstage because I couldn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way...I don't consider myself a civilian. I consider myself a soldier, and that's the way soldiers salute." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 23, 1958, People's Liberation Army forces {{commenced}} shelling Republic of China {{forces on}} the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, initiating the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Felt immediately deployed the Seventh Fleet to help the Nationalist government defend Quemoy's supply lines. [...] "We didn't go to war then because we were strong and moved in a deterrent force," [...] he later concluded. During the crisis, Felt and his staff planned {{for the use of}} tactical nuclear weapons in the Taiwan Strait because they believed the use of such weapons would not trigger World War III and because [...] "we didn't have a plan to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way".|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{people who}} {{represented}} the Expos organization have subsequently gone on to gain election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. [...] Gary Carter was inducted in 2003 {{and was the first}} player whose Hall of Fame plaque depicted him with an Expos cap. The Hall's choice for his plaque logo followed initial statements by Carter that he preferred to be enshrined as a New York Met, with whom he won the 1986 World Series. He accepted the Hall's decision with grace, stating: [...] "The fact I played 11 years in Montreal {{and the fact that the}} majority of my statistics and accomplishments were achieved there, it would be wrong, probably, to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> other way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the self-titled album, Adams announced a project he calls the [...] "PAX AM Single Series", with a new seven-inch release each month. Adams stated, [...] "I'm going to release a single every month until I can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> more." [...] The first of these releases, the 1984 EP, was released in August 2014 and is described by Adams as, [...] "pay homage to the halcyon days of the earliest releases from [...] Dischord, SST, Touch & Go and their ilk." [...] Additional singles entitled Jacksonville, Vampires, Do You Laugh When You Lie? were released in 2014 with another entitled No Shadow (featuring actor Johnny Depp, who had previously appeared on his self-titled album) in January 2015. Blue Light was released in March 2015. [...] Often selling out within minutes of being released through PAX AM's website, the singles remain available for digital download.|$|E
2500|$|The alpha build of {{the game}} was shown by Vivendi at the pre-E3 2006 show in April. Vivendi also {{released}} another list of voice actors who were appearing in the game; Al Israel, Ice-T, Oliver Platt, Daniel Dae Kim, Willa Holland, Roma Maffia, Robert LaSardo, Brenda Strong, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Ricky Gervais, Michael Rooker, Jason Mewes, Anthony Anderson, Rick Yune, Wilmer Valderrama, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara, Richard Roundtree, Tiny Lister Jr., Bai Ling, Bam Margera, Cree Summer, N.O.R.E., Tommy Lee, B-Real, Sen Dog and Elliott Gould. It was also revealed the actor voicing Montana, André Sogliuzzo, had been hand-picked by Al Pacino. In July, it was revealed Pacino had turned down the opportunity to lend his likeness to Electronic Arts' Godfather adaptation so he could appear instead in Scarface. It was also explained the reason Pacino himself was not voicing Montana was because he simply didn't sound like Montana anymore. According to Vivendi's Adam Roberts; [...] "He just can't physically <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> more. He tried, {{but it took a}} lot of physical effort to do the Montana voice - it's very heavily accented, very difficult for him to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{she heard}} that Danes was no longer keen to {{continue}} with the show, Holzman's attitude changed as well. She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> more, {{it was hard for me}} to want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at a time when we all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E
