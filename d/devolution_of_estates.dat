50|$|The rule of African {{customary}} law which generally excludes African women from intestate succession was recognised by section 23 of the Black Administration Act and the regulations framed thereunder, especially regulation 2, promulgated on 6 February 1987, in Government Gazette 10601, as Government Notice R200, making black law and custom {{applicable to the}} <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> a deceased black person. It was common cause {{in the present case}} that this system applied the principle of a male primogeniture: The estate sought a male heir, whether a descendant or a parent or a grandparent.|$|R

However, plans {{have been developed to}} allocate some <b>of</b> the Crown <b>Estate</b> income to the Big Lottery Fund, which would then distribute funds to coastal communities.

5000|$|The South African law of {{succession}} prescribes the rules which determine the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> a person’s <b>estate</b> after his death, and all matters incidental thereto. It identifies the beneficiaries who are entitled to succeed to the deceased's estate, {{and the extent of}} the benefits they are to receive, and determines the different rights and duties that persons (for example, beneficiaries and creditors) may have in a deceased's estate. It forms part of private law.|$|R
40|$|Liberia {{seems an}} {{ostensible}} 'poster child' {{in light of}} the call by women's rights advocates to insert women in all aspects of the political, social, and economic transition in post-conflict countries. Liberia has elected the first female African President and women head the strategic government ministries of Finance, Justice, Commerce, Gender, Youth and Sports and National Police. Women also helped to secure an end to fourteen years of civil war. Pressured by women, the National Legislature has. passed a revised law against rape and a <b>Devolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Estate</b> Act granting women in customary marriages the rights to own property and to take custody of their children. While acknowledging these remarkable contributions, I argue that reliance on these successes of the women's movement {{in the last several years}} is not enough to produce the kinds of changes that will bring economic benefits to ordinary women. I argue that the women's movement plurality neither ensures an automatic and equal representation for all women nor is it an all-encompassing movement for sudden empowerment for all or for equalizing life chances and opportunities. I then argue that what is needed is a developmental state that ensures a rights-based approach to state building. Without a social policy that protects at the least those whose subsistence have been decimated by the civil war, condition for sustained peace may be eroded. Assuring poor women a modicum of economic welfare is a legitimate goal. And a rights-based approach to state building gives poor women control over all areas of their daily existence and put pressure on the state to be accountable for such obligations. by William N.

50|$|In ante-nuptial contracts, duly {{registered}} in the Deeds Registry, {{it is possible to}} include provisions for the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> the spouses’ <b>estates.</b> Parties to such a contract may not unilaterally make a will that conflicts with the ante-nuptial contract. If there has been a massing (where a joint will is drawn up between two or more people who mass their estates into one common pool) and the survivor adiates (i.e. accepts the terms of the will), the survivor will receive an interest in the estate, e.g. a usufruct or fideicommissium. When the survivor dies, the property will then devolve. Note that the surviving spouse cannot unilaterally devolve his or her <b>estate</b> in terms <b>of</b> another will.|$|R
6000|$|On board one of these, Owen Davies {{worked in}} various {{capacities}} for thirteen long years. He did his drudgery well; {{but he made}} no friends, and always remained the same shy, silent, and pious man. Then suddenly a relation died without a will, {{and he found himself}} heir-in-law to Bryngelly Castle and all its revenues. Owen expressed no surprise, and to all appearance felt none. He had never seen his relation, and never dreamed <b>of</b> this romantic <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> great <b>estates</b> upon himself. But he accepted the good fortune as he had accepted the ill, and said nothing. The only people who knew him were his shipmates, and they could scarcely be held to know him. They were acquainted with his appearance and the sound of his voice, and his method of doing his duty. Also, they were aware, although he never spoke of religion, that he read a chapter of the Bible every evening, and went to church whenever they touched at a port. But of his internal self they were in total ignorance. This did not, however, prevent them from prophesying that Davies was a [...] "deep one," [...] who, now that he had got the cash, would [...] "blue it" [...] in a way which would astonish them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{test for}} wills {{distinguished}} from other tests of capacityThe test in Banks v Goodfellow is expressly {{designed for the}} capability of a person to make a will. It is not therefore a test that has an application to any other transactions, save one - the capacity to make substantial lifetime gifts. The leading English decision {{in this area is}} Re Beaney (deceased)19 [...] where it was said:“In the circumstances, {{it seems to me that}} the law is this. The degree or extent of understanding required in respect of any instrument is relative to the particular transaction which it is to effect.20 [...] In the case of a will the degree required is always high. In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift inter vivos, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction. Thus, at one extreme, if the subject matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor’s other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other extreme, if its effect is to dispose of the donor’s only asset of value and thus, for practical purposes, to pre-empt the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> his <b>estate</b> under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor understands the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.” ...|$|R
40|$|The pactum successorium : stepchild of South African law South African {{law does}} not {{generally}} permit a testator to bequeath his <b>estate</b> by means <b>of</b> contract. This rule flows from the general rule in Roman Law that an estate must devolve either by will or {{in terms of the}} law governing intestate succession. Despite the prohibition against succession pacts there have been numerous attempts by contracting parties to regulate <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> their <b>estates</b> inter vivos by means of contract. Such contracts are commonly called pacta successoria and have been regarded as contra bonos mores and invalid since early law. Although a number of reasons have been put forward for the maintaining of the prohibition against pacta successoria, the main reason for the aversion against the pactum successorium is the fact that they interfere with the testator’s freedom of testation. It is suggested that the existing law in South Africa with regard to the pactum successorium should be changed. This calls for a reappraisal of the principle of freedom of testation. It is clear that South African law takes this principle much further than is the case in other legal systems such as in England and Germany. Furthermore, the South African devotion to the principle of freedom of testation appears strange in view of the obvious conflict with the principle of freedom of contract. Finally, it is suggested that the common law prohibition against the pactum successorium should be abolished. Since {{it is clear from the}} attitude of the courts so far, this can only be effected by legislature. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> HRM functions, the rationale and problemsof such devolution to line {{management in the}} context of applications and processes in two major Japanesemultinational companies in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach - The research used mixed methodology via case studies and questionnairesurveys. Overall 29 questionnaires from two companies were analyzed, a response rate of 58 percent. In addition, the views of the Executive Director, Head of HR, and line managers were sought regardingtheir role, involvement and problems of devolvement to line managers. Findings - Analysis of questionnaire responses and interviews shows that <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> HRM functionsto the line managers was adopted by both organizations, though their approaches varied in terms ofprocess. The study revealed a high degree <b>of</b> <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> responsibility to line managers for recruitmentand selection and training and development. The <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> training and development functions specificallyto a separate department resulted in their increased effectiveness. Extensive participation and a closeworking relationship on HR-related issues between HR managers and line managers jointly contributed tothe effectiveness <b>of</b> the companies <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> HRM functions. Practical implications - <b>Devolution</b> <b>of</b> HRM functions to line management is a growing trend internationally. However, despite the positive outcomes <b>of</b> <b>devolution,</b> the process is never unproblematic. Originality/value - This study thus builds on the existing literature and also contributes to overcomingthe dearth of empirical research on devolution which has been predominantly Western in context. Furthermore, no study examining <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> the HRM functions in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The local {{governance}} of unauthorized immigration casts {{light on the}} fragmentation of policy outcomes in multi-level governance systems. The article focuses on the horizontal dimension of governance in local contexts in France and Spain. I argue that the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> competences in the policy-making and implementation of migration management and welfare, has empowered {{local and regional authorities}} in the governance of unauthorized immigration. In particular, I examine how the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> several policy domains has opened opportunities of collaboration between public and non-profit organisations. With the low <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> migration control, public-non-profit relations are dominated by advocacy and bargaining. However, with the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> welfare and social exclusion policies, non-profit become partners in the policy-making and implementation of policies. I also show that these relations are different depending on the local settings and institutional cultures in France and Spain...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{accomplish}} two tasks: One, {{it presents a}} framework to help analyze the <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> the use, management, and governance of resources. It does so by bringing together several strands of work on institutional analysis and property rights, and building on theories of collective action. These writings are highly relevant to our understanding <b>of</b> governance and <b>devolution,</b> but their relationship to devolution and governance requires closer examination than it has previously received. Two, the paper provides empirical evidence from two cases on <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> forest use from India and Nepal to illustrate and examine the offered framework. The <b>devolution</b> <b>of</b> forest use in Kumaon in India and efforts to involve local population {{in the management of}} protected areas in the Terai of Nepal form the two contrasting studies of the origins and implementation <b>of</b> <b>devolution.</b> Studying these contrasting cases enables us to examine the propositions we advance about the relationships between characteristics of devolutionary initiatives, the likelihood of an initiative being implemented successfully, and resource-related outcomes. <b>Devolution</b> <b>of</b> resource management {{is part of a larger}} conversation abou...|$|R
