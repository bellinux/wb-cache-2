5|$|Cantacuzino {{ended his}} period of {{reflection}} in January 1915, when he openly supported Alexandru Marghiloman in creating a pro-German subgroup within the Conservative Party.

5|$|Haakon Steen Lie (22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009) was a Norwegian {{politician}} {{who served as}} party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969. Coming from humble origins, he {{became involved in the}} labour movement at an early age, and quickly rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> system. After actively working for the resistance movement and the exiled government during World War II, {{he was elected to the}} second-highest position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> after the war, and his years in office were the most successful in the party's history.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{structure}} {{underwent a}} certain democratisation: <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> youth section (founded in 1953) and women's section received representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> central organs.|$|R
50|$|Sánchez {{refused to}} step down and entrenched himself within <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> headquarters, {{generating}} <b>the</b> largest crisis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> history, as neither side acknowledged the other's legitimacy to act <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> name. This situation ended when Sánchez resigned after losing a key ballot to Susana Díaz's-led rebels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> federal committee on 1 October, being replaced by a caretaker committee which subsequently chose to allow a PP minority government in order to end the 10-month political deadlock and prevent a third election in a row.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2016 <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{presented}} Julio Guzmán {{as their}} presidential {{candidate for the}} general election. However, the National Elections Jury barred him from the election after it found irregularities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> internal processes.|$|R
5|$|The Justice Party {{began to}} decline {{with the death of}} the Raja of Panagal. The lack of {{efficient}} leadership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> is regarded as the main reason for its decline.|$|E
5|$|The issue {{remained}} debated for {{the following}} two years. The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected Tătărescu to the second position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> that of general secretary.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E

5|$|Berchtold {{served in}} World War I and upon Germany's defeat joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), a small extremist {{organization}} at the time.

5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E
5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had {{to do more to}} assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.|$|E

5|$|Charlton {{lost the}} 1925 election, {{largely due to}} his stance on {{industrial}} relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor James Scullin {{went on to become}} the Prime Minister of Australia, something Charlton never managed to do.|$|E
5|$|Concerned about a divide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{costing the}} party McConnell's {{seat in the}} general election, the Republican Party of Kentucky asked both {{candidates}} to sign a pledge to support the party's eventual nominee in the general election. McConnell signed the pledge, but Bevin did not. All Republican members of Kentucky's congressional caucus joined McConnell in signing the pledge except 4th District congressman Thomas Massie, a legislator aligned with the Tea Party.|$|E
5|$|Concerned about a {{possible}} schism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{that could lead to}} a heated primary, split electorate, and weakened stance, high-ranking members of the party backed Gillibrand and requested major opponents not to run.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Chai was {{endorsed}} by renowned pharmacologist Chen-Yuan Lee, he lost the DPP chairmanship election in 1996.

5|$|Douglas {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Khrushchev again {{sought to}} further his education, {{following}} Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> flourished. When the school's Party cell elected {{a number of}} rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in Pravda. Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists. Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader {{for the city and}} a member of the Party's Central Committee. Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.|$|E

Han became the minister of education in May 1956 and retained his post as the chairman of the Writers' Union. During his ministerial career, Han initiated a campaign to diminish the importance of Russian language teaching in North Korean colleges in the spring of 1956. He also started to enlist writers with a proletarian background.|$|E
