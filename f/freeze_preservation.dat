40|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between thallus- and Conchocelisphases of Porphyra tenera KJELLMAN in general ecological aspects, especially in degree of drying injury. Though the thallus-phase of this alga shows high frost-resistance, {{it may be}} considered that the Conchocelis-phase is affected unfavorably by freezing and freeze-preservation. The present report deals with the frost-resistance of Conchocelis of Porphyra tenera, using the free- and shell-living materials. The liberation of conchospores from the shell-living Conchocelis freezepreserved at low temperatures was also observed. The results obtained are summarized as follos: When the Conchocelis-filaments were frozen and freeze-preserved in sea water, they showed lower frost-resistance than the leafy thalli. In the freezing of free- and shell-living Conchocelis-filaments, the former showed higher survival-rates of branches and conchosporangial cells. On the other hand, conchosporangial cells showed higher resistivity than cells of branches against freezing injury. Of those conchosporangial cells, mature divided sporangia survived well after <b>freeze</b> <b>preservation</b> at - 20 ℃, and could tolerate without remarkable damage at least for 1 month. In the freezing at various cooling rates, ranging from 0. 05 ℃/min to 40 ℃/min, the survival of Conchocelis-cells was less in rapid cooling than in slow cooling. The survival of Conchocelis-cells frozen at various low tempera-tures decreased according as temperature lowered. Furthermore, the survived cells of long preserved Conchocelis gradually decreased in number during freeze-preservation. Some shell-living Conchocelis, freeze-preserved for 1 month at - 20 ℃ and then thawed, liberated numerous conchospores for the following several days. アサクサノリの無基質糸状体,貝殼穿孔糸状体を海水中で凍結し,糸状体の枝や殼胞子嚢細胞の生存率をしらべた. また短期間凍結冷蔵した貝殼穿孔糸状体で解凍後の殼胞子放出数を測定した. 1. 凍結に対して,糸状体は葉体より抵抗性が低く,また貝殼穿孔糸状体は無基質糸状体に比べて凍害を受け易い. 2. 糸状体の殻胞子嚢細胞は枝より凍結に強く,とくに内容が分裂した成熟殻胞子嚢細胞は強い耐凍性を示した. 3. 冷却速度と生存率の関係は,急速凍結で凍死が多く緩慢凍結で生存が多い傾向がみられた. 4. 凍結温度が低くなるにつれて,糸状体の凍死細胞は増加する. また凍結冷蔵の期間が長くなると,生存率は徐々に低下する. 5. 貝殼穿孔糸状体を短期間(1 ケ月以内) 凍結冷蔵した場合は,解凍後多くの殼胞子を放出するものがみられた...|$|E

40|$|The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, {{represents}} an ecologically and economically {{important component of}} marine and estuarine ecosystems. In Florida, blue crab landings accounted for 9. 6 million dollars during the 2010 fishing season. Accurate stock assessments for this valuable fishery are essential. Age is a critical biological component of accurate stock assessments; however, blue crabs and other crustaceans are especially difficult to age because of the complex nature of discrete growth. Biochemical extraction of an aging pigment, lipofuscin, was developed using blue crab eyestalks. The current study investigated the effects of <b>freezing</b> <b>preservation</b> on lipofuscin extracts and examined whether the extraction methodology, developed by Chesapeake Bay researchers, was useful for aging Tampa Bay blue crabs populations. Significant differences in lipofuscin index were found between samples frozen (2 weeks at - 80 °C) prior to analysis and those processed and assayed immediately (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Quarterly assays of the cohort of known-age individuals revealed a negative linear trend (y = - 0. 12 x + 0. 49, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) in lipofuscin index over a 12 -month period. This result suggests that extraction of lipofuscin is not appropriate for age determination of Florida blue crabs. Investigations into possible causes of the negative trend in lipofuscin suggest this method deserves further examination and refinement before it is acceptable as a reliable method for age determination in Florida blue crabs.

40|$|Sepsis, a {{life-threatening}} systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by infection, is widely studied using laboratory animal models. While cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) {{is considered the}} gold standard model for sepsis research, {{it may not be}} preferable for experiments comparing animals of different size or under different dietary regimens. By comparing cecum size, shape, and cecal content characteristics in mice under different experimental conditions (aging, diabetes, pancreatitis), we show that cecum variability could be problematic for some CLP experiments. The cecal slurry (CS) injection model, in which the cecal contents of a laboratory animal are injected intraperitoneally to other animals, is an alternative method for inducing polymicrobial sepsis; however, the CS must be freshly prepared under conventional protocols, which is a major disadvantage with respect to reproducibility and convenience. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an improved CS preparation protocol that allows for long-term storage of CS with reproducible results. Using our new CS preparation protocol we found that bacterial viability is maintained for at least 6 months when the CS is prepared in 15 % glycerol-PBS and stored at - 80 °C. To test sepsis-inducing efficacy of stored CS stocks, various amounts of CS were injected to young (4 - 6 months old), middle-aged (12 - 14 months old), and aged (24 - 26 months old) male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Dose- and age-dependent mortality was observed with high reproducibility. Circulating bacteria levels strongly correlated with mortality suggesting an infection-mediated death. Further, injection with heat-inactivated CS resulted in acute hypothermia without mortality, indicating that CS-mediated death is not due to endotoxic shock. This new CS preparation protocol results in CS stocks which are durable for <b>freezing</b> <b>preservation</b> without loss of bacterial viability, allowing experiments to be performed more conveniently and with higher reproducibility than before...|$|R

Moisture content of Bele fish is higher than Tilapia fish. With the increasing days of storage, moisture content of these fish is decreased. Water holding capacity, Drip loss and TVN value were used as parameter for the determination of the extent of spoilage changes of these preserved fish. Water holding capacity of Tilapia fish was 350 g H 2 O/ 100 g of fish but it gradually decreased to 315 g H 2 O/ 100 g.

In addition, their position in their locality within dentine, peripheral to the pulp area could help {{the creation of an}} odontoblast-like cell lining integrated into the dentine wall. Third molars or any to-be-extracted teeth for orthodontic purposes are good source of autogenous dentine matrix. Yet, these matrixes are supposed to be preserved until needed. <b>Freezing</b> makes long-term <b>preservation</b> of human dentine matrix possible as it maintains the mechanical properties of the matrix (Chen et al. 2015 b; Jiao et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Immunocytochemistry is a {{compromise}} between maintaining antigenicity and preserving tissue morphology. In the testis, successful immunostaining results {{at the level of}} resolution provided by the light microscope have been obtained through use of either frozen or paraffin sections, although both techniques are fraught with limitations. With <b>freezing,</b> tissue <b>preservation</b> is not optimum, whereas with paraffin embedding, antigenicity is often destroyed. These limitations are not trivial and have led to numerous ambiguous results in the literature. In the present study we wish to report the results of immunocytochemical local-ization of various proteins in testis fixed by perfusion with Bouin's fluid and embedded in polyester wax, a ribboning embedding medium for histology. The advantages of this medium are that it does not require clearing of tissues in xylene solvents before embedding and that unlike paraffin, it liquifies at 38 °C. Because of these two properties, the polyester was appears to adequately maintain antigenicity as compared to that observed in frozen sections, yet because it is a ribboning wax, it preserves detailed structure as well as paraffin does. Proteins that were immunolocalized included cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin, actin, vinculin, vimentin) and cell-specific markers: 1) androgen-binding protein (ABP) for Sertoli cells; 2) peripheral type benzodiazepine re-ceptor (PBR) for Leydig cells; and 3) nuclear lamins for germ cells. Biotin-streptavidin peroxidase immunocytochemistry was employed to determine the specific distribution of the various proteins, and both rabbit antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies were used with equal success. In addition, fluorochrome-labeled second antibodies combined with confocal microscopy wer...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 American Chemical SocietyThis paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} frozen-stored red must {{as an alternative to}} fresh must to permit research fermentations outside the vintage period. Additionally, the fermentation size (20, 50, and 300 kg) was also compared. Chemical analyses of six wines showed little variation in color profiles and final ethanol and organic acid concentrations. More importantly from a winemaking point of view, a descriptive sensory analysis revealed that all wines across each treatment and fermentation scale compared very well to each other. Key differences were limited to more appealing characteristics (i. e., lower tannin hardness and burnt/smoky attributes and higher fresh/fruity and red berry attributes) in the wine made on a 300 kg scale from frozen must. This study therefore provides quantitative data on the effectiveness of <b>freezing</b> for fruit <b>preservation</b> as well as the ability of small volume fermentations (20 and 50 kg) to be representative of conditions approaching those found in industry.

40|$|INTERVENTION(S) : Eighty-one ovaries were {{randomly}} assigned to fresh control, conventional freezing (CF), and directional freezing (DF) group. Ovaries of CF and DF groups were perfused via the ovarian artery with Leibovitz L- 15 medium, 10 % fetal bovine serum, and 1. 5 M dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 minutes. Each ovary was inserted into a glass test tube containing 10 mL of the same solution and cooled to - 100 °C or - 70 °C, respectively. Ovaries were stored in liquid nitrogen for a minimum of 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Structural integrity of cortical and medulla regions, vascular integrity, follicle in vitro development, cell proliferation, and DNA damage and repair. RESULT(S) : All examined parameters indicate that the structure of DF ovaries remains largely intact and comparable to fresh controls, whereas significant damages were observed in CF ovaries. CONCLUSION(S) : Directional <b>freezing</b> allows good <b>preservation</b> of whole ovaries, with most of the parameters taken into consideration almost identical to those recorded in fresh control samples. This encourages a reconsideration of the possible use of whole-ovary cryopreservation as a viable alternative to cortical fragments...|$|R
