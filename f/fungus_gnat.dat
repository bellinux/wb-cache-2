40|$|<b>Fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> (Bradysia corophila and Bradsysia impatiens) are {{of great}} {{importance}} to greenhouse growers. Larvae may feed on roots or root hairs of young plants. This can lead to stunting or even death in young plants. It can also create {{a means by which}} pathogens can enter the plant. Adult <b>Fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> can possibly carry plant pathogens and possibly infect older plants.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of associations between insects and fungi. Where the fungi involved are pathogens, such associations may be of economic importance. Insects of no economic concern alone can also become important pests because of their association with fungal pathogens. Insects may assist in the spread of pathogens by carrying them on or in their bodies. Insects may also predispose plants to infection by creating wounds during feeding, oviposition or other behavioural activities. Knowledge of associations between insects and fungal pathogens often form a crucial component in the management strategy of these pathogens. The pitch canker fungus, Fusarium circinatum, causes severe disease symptoms on mature pines in the USA. Various insects have been implicated as vectors of this disease. In South Africa, F. circinatum is reported only to cause disease on pine seedlings, where it results in severe losses in nurseries. Various insects {{are present in the}} nursery that could possibly be associated with the spread of the fungus or the infection of its hosts. Amongst these insects, <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> are the prime suspects due to their history of association with fungal pathogens in other nurseries. The presence of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> in South African pine nurseries and their possible association with F. circinatum and other pathogens has never been investigated critically. The objective {{of this study was to}} expand the base of knowledge of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> in South African pine nurseries, and to consider their possible association with F. circinatum and their population structure within and between nurseries. The literature review provides a summary of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> in the nursery environment. This includes their description, biology and association with fungal pathogens. Information from these studies is used to evaluate the possible association between <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> and F. circinatum in South African pine nurseries. In nurseries around the world where <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> are considered pests, various control options have been used, and these are further discussed. The first research aim of this study was to determine whether <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> are present in the major pine nurseries of South Africa. Thus, in Chapter 2, surveys were undertaken in four of the major pine nurseries. All <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> collected were identified to species level. Other diptera collected were identified to family level. Furthermore, all diptera collected were isolated on general and selective growing medium to examine for the presence of F. circinatum. Results from Chapter 2 showed that only one species of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> was present in the nurseries and it was present in all four of the nurseries surveyed. This raised interesting questions regarding the phylogeographic structure of these populations and the diversity within and between populations. These questions are addressed in Chapter 3 using analysis of mitochondrial COI sequence data from <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> collected in the four nurseries. Of particular importance was the interpretation of these results as it pertains to the movement of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> between populations, together with their associated fungi. Using general and specific growing medium to isolate fungal pathogens from insects is not necessarily an accurate method. Pathogens may be overgrown by faster growing fungi before they are noticed, especially if they are present only in small amounts. Chapter 4 examined the use of DNA-based methods as a tool to detect fungal pathogens on <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats.</b> <b>Fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> were collected from the same four nurseries as in Chapter 2. Species-specific primers for F. circinatum and Botrytis cinerea were used to detect these fungi. Dilution series were done to examine the sensitivity of the primers. General primers were used to detect other fungi. This dissertation includes some of the first studies ever undertaken on <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> in South African pine nurseries. Their association with the very virulent pitch canker fungus is also considered in some detail. It is my hope that these studies will form a foundation for future research on <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> in South Africa. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a {{widespread}} plant pathogen that produces structures known as sclerotia. When sclerotia germinate they give rise to infective hyphae, myceliogenic germination, or they produce ascocarps, carpogenic germination. Biological control has usually targeted sclerotia or ascospores. The main objectives of the research presented herein were to observe {{the effect of a}} mycoparasite and <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> (Bradysia coprophila) on the survival of sclerotia in vitro and in field conditions, and to study the enzymatic activity of the mycoparasite when in contact with sclerotia damaged by <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats.</b> In this research several mycoparasites were evaluated for their efficacy to degrade sclerotia in soil. From these tests, an isolate of Trichoderma hamatum, TMCS 3 proved to be the most effective. Larvae of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> have also been reported to feed on sclerotia. When both organisms were combined in laboratory tests, fewer sclerotia survived than when the organisms acted alone. Sclerotia recovered from this treatment contained fewer viable cells when compared to sclerotia recovered from treatments with TMCS 3 or <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> alone. The results obtained from field trials showed that TMCS 3 was effective at degrading sclerotia. Unfortunately environmental conditions were not always optimal for the establishment of high populations of <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats.</b> Few larvae were observed feeding on sclerotia and {{no significant differences were found}} among treatments. Growth of TMCS 3 was studied using different carbon sources as substrates, including sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Biomass obtained from this latter treatment was significantly larger than on the other carbon sources tested. Enzymatic activity was also induced by the presence of sclerotia. In many cases, sclerotial exudates from mechanically damaged sclerotia or sclerotia damaged by larval feeding showed that the concentration of amino acids, carbohydrates, and electrolytes was increased as damage to the sclerotia has increased. Exudation of protein was not different when damaged and undamaged sclerotia were compared. Exudates from sclerotia with the melanized rind completely removed by <b>fungus</b> <b>gnats</b> feeding accelerated the germination of conidia of TMCS 3. These heavily damaged sclerotia also enhanced the growth of TMCS 3 when both organisms were grown together. However enzymatic (i. e. glucanase and chitinase) activity of TMCS 3 was not increased by the damage to the sclerotia. When damaged sclerotia were buried in soil infested with TMCS 3 they were degraded faster when the medulla of sclerotia was completely uncovered by larval feeding...|$|R
