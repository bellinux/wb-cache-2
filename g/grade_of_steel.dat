50|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of this class of steel is the ability to be case hardened by carburization of the surface.

50|$|Iron {{and steel}} are the world's most {{recycled}} materials, {{and among the}} easiest materials to reprocess, {{as they can be}} separated magnetically from the waste stream. Recycling is via a steelworks: scrap is either remelted in an electric arc furnace (90-100% scrap), or used as part of the charge in a Basic Oxygen Furnace (around 25% scrap). Any <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> can be recycled to top quality new metal, with no 'downgrading' from prime to lower quality materials as steel is recycled repeatedly. 42% of crude steel produced is recycled material.|$|E

Between 1877 and 1904 they designed and manufactured agricultural equipment. In 1888 they started manufacture of a wrought ploughshare using a resilient <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> developed for him by Meadow's company in England.

5000|$|SAE 316L grade {{stainless}} steel {{is a standard}} for an austenic variety of {{stainless steel}} given the American SAE designation [...] "316L" [...] which indicates that this steel is low-carbon subtype of marine grade stainless steel containing 16-18% chromium, 10-14% nickel, 2.0-3.0% molybdenum, {{and no more than}} 0.03% carbon, 2% manganese, 0.75% silicon, 0.045% phosphorus, 0.03% sulphur, and 0.1% nitrogen by weight, with the remainder consisting entirely of iron (by comparison, regular 316 grade may contain up to 0.08% carbon by weight).

5000|$|Steel is {{the oldest}} and highest tensile {{strength}} strapping. It is available {{in a variety of}} widths and thicknesses as well as variations in the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> Steel is used for heavy duty holding where high strength and minimal stretch are desired. Surface finishes for steel strap include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax. The wax is used to better transmit the tension around the bundle and for use with certain types of tensioners. Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, baling wire, bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. Steel Strapping is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process. A 3/4 x [...]020 Steel Strapping Coil yields approximately 19.6 feet per pound.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s North British {{signed a deal}} with the German company MAN to {{construct}} further diesel engines under licence. These power units appeared in the late 1950s' British Railways (BR) designs pre-TOPS British Rail Class D3/1 (later D3/4), and later designated Class 21, Class 22, Class 41, Class 43 (Warship) and Class 251 (Blue Pullman) None of these were particularly successful: constructional shortcomings with the MAN engines made them far less reliable than German-built examples. A typical example of this was the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> used for exhaust manifolds in the Class 43s - frequent manifold failures led to loss of turbocharger drive gas pressure and hence loss of power. More importantly, the driving cabs of the locomotives would fill with poisonous exhaust fumes. BR returned many North British diesel locomotives to their builder for repair under warranty and they also insisted on a three-month guarantee on all repairs (a requirement not levied on its own workshops).|$|E

50|$|During the process, {{atoms of}} carbon and {{nitrogen}} diffuse interstitially into the metal, creating barriers to slip, increasing the hardness and modulus near the surface. Carbonitriding is often applied to inexpensive, easily machined {{low carbon steel}} to impart the surface properties of more expensive and difficult to work <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> Surface hardness <b>of</b> carbonitrided parts ranges from 55 to 62 HRC.|$|R
