40|$|Chemical {{communication}} between sperm and egg {{is a critical}} factor mediating sexual reproduction. Sperm attractants may be significant evolutionarily for maintaining species barriers, and important ecologically for increasing gamete encounters. Still unresolved, however, are the functional consequences of these dissolved signal molecules. Here, we provide experimental evidence that sperm chemoattraction directly affects the magnitude of fertilization success. The recent discovery of l-tryptophan as a potent attractant to red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) sperm affords the opportunity to quantify how navigation affects gamete interactions. Sperm behavioral responses to manipulations of the natural tryptophan gradient around individual eggs reveals that both chemotaxis and chemokinesis significantly promote contacts. Our results show further that attractant release by means of diffusion effectively doubles the target size of red abalone eggs, which in turn significantly increases fertilization success. Although long theorized as potential barriers to hybridization, species-specific sperm attractants in red and <b>green</b> (Haliotis fulgens) <b>abalone</b> are only minor contributors to maintaining reproductive isolation. Because abalone typically live in dense, multispecies aggregations, chemically mediated navigation would prevent sperm from pointlessly tracking heterospecific eggs. Thus, even though reproductive isolation fundamentally resides {{at the level of}} membrane recognition proteins, species-specific sperm attractants may evolve to locate the right target within mixed gamete suspensions of closely related species...|$|R

5000|$|Ritz Guitar Co. {{produced}} guitars in 1988 and 1989 over an 8-month {{period in}} Southern California in Wayne Charvel's workshop in Ontario. The company became known quality based upon Wayne's notoriety {{and for their}} amazing cracked shell mosaic finishes on their 'Neptune' series which was originally patented, designed and built by Andy Soler. Each little piece of shell was hand-cracked and stuck on the guitar body by hand. Introduced to Andy Soler's nephew Eric Galletta and eventually produced by Wayne Charvel, Andy Soler and Eric Galletta with Ritz being financially backed and majority owned co founders Brad Becnel's Sunset Ladders (Sunset Guitars) of South El Monte, CA and Cliff Wildes (Microtech International Inc CEO and the band [...] "Off White") of East Haven Conn, they made around 150 guitars with only about 25 being the cracked shell 'Neptune' models. The first two collectable models were handmade by Wayne Charvel in Gold Abalone and gold plated hardware for Cliff Wildes and a White Abalone for Brad Becnel, both featured in Ritz magazine ads. The other models were the 'Exotic' series, which used rare woods (e.g. Cocobolo) and kept them as a natural finish, there was a one off 'Exotic' model made from small pieces of rare woods stuck together like a mosaic to form {{the body of the}} guitar, in a similar idea to the shell finished 'Neptune' series. The lower cost 'Classic' Series had painted or Zolatone finishes with Wayne Charvel making his first ever 1 of a kind Midi guitar in corvette red for Wildes. All body shapes were Strat style, however, there is a rumor that a V shaped Ritz Neptune exists. The examples of shell types available were; Violet Oyster, Brown Lip, Black Lip, <b>Green</b> Shell, <b>Abalone</b> Shell, Nautilius Shell, and Snake Lip. Most Ritz Neptunes had Alder bodies for their light weight and some with Maple or Bubinga bodies under the shell finish. They mainly used Seymour Duncan, PAF (pickup) or Schaller Guitarenparts pickups (The Schaller's were custom made for Ritz and looked a little like EMG's and renamed as 'Ritz pickups' for the catalog, the Schaller's were the pick ups that Michael Angelo Batio used on his Rocket model.). All came with the Kahler Tremolo System Spyder model. The guitars retailed for over $2000.00. Most of the later Ritz guitars featured Warmoth Guitars necks made for Ritz as Ritz were running out of money and time to make their own. These necks were thinner than the Ritz made necks but still very good. The Warmoth logo can be located at the join on the on these necks if you take them off. Also a few Ritz Guitars were made after the demise of the company in 1991. This is thought to be because Wayne Charvel had a few Ritz necks left over and he attached them to one off custom orders at a little less money. A great book to read by the man himself Wayne Charvel is “The Custom Guitar Shop” which includes the Ritz story.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{communication}} between sperm and eggs is ubiquitous in organisms with widely divergent reproductive strategies. Sperm attractants {{are found in}} marine taxa that broadcast their gametes into the sea, as well as terrestrial organisms with internal fertilization, such as humans. Chemosensory-mediated behavior thus is a key component in sperm-egg interactions and fertilization. Despite nearly a century of research, the mechanisms controlling fertilization {{remains one of the}} least understood biological processes. For example, waterborne egg-factors that attract sperm are thought to be ecologically meaningful for increasing gamete encounters, or evolutionary significant by maintaining species barriers, but the contributions remains unknown. In this study, I (i) developed analytical and behavioral techniques to establish the reproductive consequences of sperm attractants, and (ii) examined the biological processes controlling fertilization success in the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. Using RP and size-exclusion chromatographic teclmiques, the amino acid L-tryptophan, was found to be the natural sperm attractant. The production of tryptophan from live abalone eggs elicited sperm chemotaxis, effectively doubling the egg size. When the enzyme tryptophanase, which selectively degrades tryptophan, was added to the seawater around eggs, sperm no longer were able to locate the eggs, gamete encounters dropped, and fertilization levels dramatically lowered. Thus, the natural tryptophan gradient is critical for gamete encounters. To establish the evolutionary consequences of sperm attractants, red and <b>green</b> (Haliotis fulgens) <b>abalone</b> gametes were crossed, and fertilization assays conducted. Although long theorized as baniers to hybridization, species-specific sperm attractants were only minor contributors to reproductive isolation. When the influence of sperm and egg concentration, sperm-to-egg ratio, and gamete contact times on reproductive success was established, egg concentration had the same effect as sperm concentration on fertilization rates, and eggs, not sperm, were the limiting factor controlling abalone fecundity. These results contrast widely with the theory that sperm is the primary determinant for fe 1 iilization success. Given the fact that eggs, rather then sperm, effectively control reproduction, chemoattractants may have evolved thru sperm competition. ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Crudely {{partitioned}} extracts of nine sponge {{samples from}} Catherine Hill Bay, NSW, Australia, were screened for dynamin 1 bioactivity. Dynamin 1 is an enzyme {{that is essential}} for clathrin coated vesicle formation in endocytosis and {{has been linked to}} many neurological disease for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer. At 1 mg / mL, the methanol extract of sponge YMB 080612 CB 01 showed the strongest inhibition, i. e. lowest dynamin 1 activity (5 %), among all tested samples. Bioassay-guided isolation of these extracted fractions to yield pure active compounds was to no avail, as activities were lost during fractionation and compounds targeted because of the appearance of distinctive ¹H NMR signals (not lipids or steroids) continually disappeared. Fucosterol (76) was isolated from an inactive fraction. In a separate study, chemistry of endemic Australian brown alga Cystophora xiphocarpa was investigated. Steroidal compounds that had been previously isolated from C. xiphocarpa were re-isolated using a more efficient methodology. These compounds, comprising nine steroids (76 to 84) and a phaeophytin 86 were screened for antibacterial, anticancer and dynamin 1 bioactivity. All tested compounds revealed no antibacterial activity against S. epidermis, E. faecalis and M. catarrhalis. Of the compounds tested against 12 cancer cell lines, steroid 83 displayed GI₅₀ 8. 7 ± 0. 7 µM in colon cancer line HT 29, GI₅₀ 5. 6 ± 0. 8 µM in breast cancer line MCF- 7 and GI₅₀ 4. 5 ± 0. 2 µM in ovarian cancer cell line A 2780 which makes it the most active anticancer tested compound in this steroid series. Steroid 78 is active against the ovarian cancer cell line A 2780 with GI₅₀ 6. 2 ± 0. 1 µM, the colon cancer cell line HT 29 with GI₅₀ 18 ± 0. 0 µM and the breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 with GI₅₀ 21 ± 6. 00 µM, while its epimer, steroid 77, is inactive against all cell cancer lines. Diastereoisomers 81 and 82 showed moderate activities against dynamin 1 with IC₅₀ 62. 9 ± 15. 2 µM, the first reported potential dynamin 1 inhibitor from natural sources. Phaeophytin A 86, which has been suggested to have potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases was found to be inactive in dynamin 1 screening. Investigation of the configuration of diastereoisomers of steroids 77 and 78 was completed by derivatization of compound 78 using phosgene to form a cyclic carbonate 108, molecular modelling and coupling constant analysis. In addition, compounds previously not reported from C. xiphocarpa were isolated. These compounds are a series of steroids (87 to 92, 98) and fucoxanthin (99). Compounds 88 to 90 displayed no potential anticancer activities against all cancer cell lines. Fucoxanthin, which was tested for antibacterial activity, is inactive.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, five species of abalone (genus Haliotis) in California waters have gone from {{harvestable}} resources to rare or even endangered species status. Both anthropogenic (overexploitation, habitat destruction) and natural (disease, predation) factors {{have contributed to the}} declines. This dissertation explores several aspects of abalone recovery and conservation along the coast of California through population genetic theory and techniques. Chapters I and II deal with the captive breeding of two California abalone species. Chapter I focuses on ensuring the specific purity of broodstock and maintaining genetic diversity in hatchery-bred progeny of the endangered white abalone (H. soreseni). Using DNA from these animals, genetic markers were developed, including five nuclear microsatellite loci and partial sequences of one nuclear (VERL) and two mitochondrial (COI and CytB) genes, to assess genetic variability in the species, aid in species identification (ergo prevent broodstock contamination), and potentially track the success of future outplanting of captive-reared animals in restocking operations. Chapter II quantifies the loss of genetic diversity resulting from the captive breeding of <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> (H. fulgens). No change in overall heterozygosity was evident, but significant losses in allelic richness were found in the captive-bred <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> versus that in wild populations. Chapters III, IV, and V center on inferring realized connectivity (gene flow) among natural populations of red (H. rufescens), black (H. cracherodii), and pink (H. corrugata) abalone. For red abalone (Chapter III), COI sequencing and microsatellite genotyping did not show significant genetic divergence among populations. In contrast, data from AFLPs became the first to suggest there is significant genetic differentiation among California red abalone populations. In black abalone (Chapter IV), data from AFLPs and one microsatellite locus showed significant divergence among multiple populations and exhibited a signal of isolation by distance consistent with a stepping-stone model of connectivity. Pink abalone (Chapter V) also showed evidence of restricted gene flow among populations. Finally, Chapters VI and VII focus on the fatal disease withering syndrome (WS). Chapter VI involves characterizing the post-esophageal microbiomes of red and black abalone with and without WS. Significant differences between the clone libraries isolated from healthy and diseased abalone suggested that WS has significant impact on the bacterial composition of the abalone post-esophageal microbiome, and specific membership of the microbiomes suggests that infection by Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, the etiological agent of WS, may not be the sole cause of morbidity and mortality due to WS in abalone. Chapter VII is a preliminary study of genetic variation within C. X. californiensis samples from wild and captive-bred abalone species collected from multiple locations along the coast of California. Thus far, no variation has been found in partial sequences of either the 16 S rDNA or recombinase A (recA) gene...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, we have {{witnessed}} dramatic declines of abalone stocks along the southern California coast. What was once an important fisheries resource (commercial and recreational) has completely disappeared and {{there is now a}} moratorium on all abalone harvesting in the region (California Department of Fish and Game 2002). Populations of white, red, black, pink and <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> have all been impacted; the former species, Haliotis sorenseni, has become the first marine invertebrate to be listed as an endangered species. Both anthropogenic (overexploitation and habitat destruction) and natural (disease and predation) processes have contributed to the decline in abalone abundance. Attempts to develop effective conservation and recovery strategies for abalone require understanding many aspects of the biology of these species. The primary question is: can reproduction in remnant populations provide the recruits necessary for recovery of abalone populations that have gone locally extinct? Two factors are important in answering this question. First, {{there is the question of}} fertilization success in low abundance populations of broadcast spawning invertebrates; can males and females locate one another and successfully produce fertilized eggs? The second issue regards the level of "connectivity" of abalone populations; can success in one part of the species range provide a natural reseeding in other parts of the range? This project used population genetic methods to address the latter question...|$|E
40|$|Time-course {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} juvenile <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis fulgens) to assess the degree of stress caused by the anesthetics magnesium sulfate (MS), benzocaine (BZ), and phenoxyethanol (PE). Metabolic rate (VO 2) of abalone was reduced by 65, 35, and 18 % during short-term (10 or 20 min) exposure to MS, BZ, and PE, respectively. Abalones significantly increased their VO 2 above control values (1. 5 -fold) after removal of PE from metabolic chambers, whereas those treated with MS or BZ recovered their VO 2 to preanesthesia values. Visual criteria of recovery generally coincided with those of metabolic measurements (i. e., 80 % of abalone regained "normal" activity after 35 min postanesthesia), yet metabolic measurements showed that "fast" recovering abalone treated with PE maintained high VO 2 values during 3 -h postanesthesia. Abalone treated and nontreated with anesthetics exhibited a circadian metabolic rhythm, with 20 - 35 % higher rates observed during dark than light hours. Despite the short-term metabolic alterations with MS, BZ, and PE, the present study suggests that all three anesthetics may be safely used in abalone. However, detailed evaluations are still needed to assess the effect of anesthesia on other physiological variables. The results obtained in this study highlight the importance of physiological evaluations when different chemical substances are used in aquatic invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|While {{relatively}} small, the San Diego-La Jolla Ecological Reserve {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in California, and it contains giant-kelp-forest, boulder-reef, submarine-canyon and sandy-shelf habitats. We evaluated the effectiveness of this 'no-take' marine reserve and gauged its success according to the goals implicit in its design. To overcome the lack of data prior to its establishment, we employed habitat-specific analyses. Our study comprised 4 components: (1) an historical review of its establishment; (2) a survey of conspicuous species in kelp-forest, submarine-canyon, and boulder-reef habitats; (3) comparisons with historical data; (4) a public survey regarding awareness, knowledge, and support of the reserve. Despite 30 yr of protection, only a few sessile or residential species exhibit positive effects of protection, and most fished species have decreased in abundance inside the reserve. However, the reserve protects the largest remaining populations of <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis fulgens and vermillion rockfish Sebastes miniatus in the area, which therefore represent important sources of larvae. Implementation and enforcement of coastal reserves depends on public support, but the results of the public survey indicated a lack of knowledge of the reserve, highlighting the need for improved public education in this respect. The results of the study reflect the limited value of small reserves and document the inadequacy of inside/outside comparisons as tests of reserve effectiveness when baseline and historical data are lacking...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{my thesis}} {{project was to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of two marine reserves in Isla Natividad (Mexico) as a management tool for the <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis fulgens) fishery. The {{first step was to}} develop and calibrate a demographic for <b>green</b> <b>abalone</b> to describe its dynamic when subjected to exploitation. To do so, I defined a size-based matrix model that allows incorporating information on growth, size-specific survival and size-specific fecundities; specifically, I conducted an extensive literary review to estimate the corresponding vital rates. I also used fishery data collected by fishermen on Isla Natividad to calibrate the model, i. e. to estimate density-dependence in the larval stage and size-dependent fishing mortality. In particular, through this model, I: - examined recent trends in abalone abundance in Isla Natividad and compared the current status of the stock with theoretical carrying capacity; - computed informative fishery reference points such as maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and effort that guarantees the MSY to compare them with current and historical fishery yields and exploitation rates; -assessed the recovery potential of abalone populations and investigate the likely trend of abundances and yields under different exploitation scenarios. Then, I investigated if the reserves can increase, or at least maintain, the catch of abalones in the fishable areas through larval spillover, that is, a net export of larvae during the planktonic stage from the protected toward the unprotected zones. The expected increase in abalone abundance inside the marine reserves and the increase in mean size of sexual mature individuals, in fact, could positively influence the reproductive output of the population with an enhanced production of eggs, which, through larval dispersal, can contribute to the recruitment also in the areas outside the reserve. To explore the likely trends in abundance and catches of these commercially important species both in the short and in the long term, I extended the above-mentioned model formulation by defining a spatially-explicit version of the model. I assumed that the populations were distributed along a linear array of contiguous patches, representing the fishable and the protected blocks along the perimeter of the island. As abalones are sedentary species, I assumed that the connectivity between subpopulations was driven by the exchange of larvae in the planktonic phase. Dispersal kernels for larval movement were defined to describe movement probability between more or less distant patches. In particular, I: - examined the likely trends in abalone abundance and fishery yields catches under different assumptions of reserve establishment (intended as percentage of fishing grounds protected and size of individual no-take areas); - assessed if larval spillover effect can compensate for the decrease in abalone catches due to the reduction of the fishing grounds, and, if yes, after how much time are the benefits likely to occur; -analyzed if the results in terms of population trends and fishery benefits are sensitive to the spatial arrangement of the reserve...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the main diatom taxa {{found in the}} natural diet of Haliotis fulgens Philippi (<b>green</b> <b>abalone)</b> and H. corrugata Wood (pink abalone) juvenile specimens and loose rocks were collected from different depths at two sites in Bahía Tortugas and Bahía Asunción, Baja California Sur. Overall 113 benthic diatom species were identified, and 98 taxa were recorded in the gut contents of both abalone species. Out of these 32 were not observed in the surrounding flora. Most diatom taxa were epiphytic forms, including the abundant taxa found in the gut contents of young abalone: Berkeleya fennica, Cocconeis speciosa, Cocconeis costata var. pacifica, Gomphonemopsis pseudexigua, Grammatophora marina, Navicula parva, Tabularia investiens, and Thalassionema nitzschioides. This somewhat re-flected {{the structure of the}} diatom assemblages in the rocky habitat: few abundant taxa and many rare or uncommon ones, with heterogeneous values of diversity (H') that ranged between 1. 1 and 4. 2 in the gut contents and from 2. 83 to 3. 91 in the surrounding flora. New records for the area include Cocconeis pseudomarginata, C. maxima (common), Licmosoma sp., Ardissonia formosa (rare), and the colonial form Berkeleya fennica (abundant), all found within the gut contents of abalone. The actual and potential diet of young abalone on the coast of Baja California Sur is extended to 235 taxa.

Growth and fatty acid composition of the muscle tissue were {{compared to that of}} abalone fed a reference diet that contained no added lipids (0. 25 % total lipids). After 75 days of culture in a flow-through system, no significant differences in growth were found among abalone fed the different oil types. Responses to different dietary levels of lipid were significantly different but not to sources of oils. Maximum growth was achieved at a 1. 5 % inclusion of oil sources. It appears that abalone have a great capacity to synthesize lipid from carbohydrate sources. Results also suggest that abalone are capable of desaturation and elongation of 18 C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n - 3 and n - 6 family to 20 : 5 n - 3 and 20 : 4 n - 6. Synthesis of 22 : 6 n - 3 from 20 : 5 n - 3 is not reflected in the results. The lack of a growth response to the different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) provided by the different oils included in the experimental diets may be due to an insufficient duration of the experiment to achieve an essential fatty acid deficiency. The relationship between fatty acid profiles of tissue and the diets fed to the abalone suggests that metabolic activity of the gut microflora is not a source of essential fatty acids.
