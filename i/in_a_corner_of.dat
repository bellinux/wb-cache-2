5|$|In Ukraine, a {{memorial}} complex was erected {{to honor the}} over 4300 officer victims of the Katyń massacre murdered in Pyatykhatky, 14kilometres/8.7miles north of Kharkiv in Ukraine; the complex lies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a former resort home for NKVD officers. Children had discovered hundreds of Polish officer buttons whilst playing on the site.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the room, far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> our 60m3 room {{farthest}} {{away from}} the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England. The first castle in Lydford, {{sometimes}} termed the Norman fort, was a small ringwork built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxon fortified burh in the years after the Norman conquest of England. It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068. The Norman fort had been abandoned {{by the middle of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Kateri i Radës {{were transported}} to a {{concrete}} platform {{in the port}} of Otranto as {{a monument to the}} tragedy. The project cost €150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos. Before the project, {{what was left of the}} ship lay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the port of Brindisi. The project was titled L'Approdo. Opera all'Umanità Migrante (The Landing. A work dedicated to Migrating Humanity). Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë. The families of the dead requested for the relics of Kateri i Radës to be placed in Albania after Italian media reported that it was to be used as a monument.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E

5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

25|$|There {{was great}} {{nostalgia for the}} LaSalle name, and at various points in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, General Motors issued Motorama cars and {{proposed}} new consumer automobiles under the name.

Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E
25|$|Great Falls High School {{was founded}} {{in the fall of}} 1890 by the city of Great Falls after four teenage girls (newly arrived in the city) asked to receive a high school public education.

By September 1892, Great Falls High School was an independent school within the city public school system.
