5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, only two of the ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the communists}} {{captured}} Beijing in January 1949, the Nationalists began {{to retreat to}} Taiwan. China's <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> was moved to Taiwan in February. The government then declared in the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion that dollars issued by the Bank of Taiwan would become the new currency in circulation.|$|E
25|$|The line {{played an}} {{important}} role in the World War II in 1940, when Germany attacked Norway ("Operation Weserübung"). Bergen and Trondheim and with a little delay Oslo, were quickly occupied by Germany, but not Åndalsnes, Ålesund and Molde. This allowed British forces to land in this area, and the king, government and the <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> could be sent to the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|In 1936, 510 tonnes of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> were {{transferred}} to the Soviet Union (in an event known as Moscow gold) corresponding to 72.6% of the total <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> of the Bank of Spain. That gold remained there during the Spanish Civil War.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} influence {{for this}} document, was the Battle of Drøbak Sound, where the Oscarsborg Fortress at the ship route to Oslo {{opened fire on}} own decision on passing German warships and sank the leading one. This gave the King and the government several hours of time to order mobilization, evacuate the <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> and leave Oslo for London. In Denmark the King and the government were surprised by German troops in {{their homes in the}} night and made no resistance.|$|E

25|$|The KMT {{took control}} of Taiwan's {{monopolies}} that had been owned by the Japanese prior to World War II. They nationalized approximately 17% of Taiwan's GNP and voided Japanese bond certificates held by Taiwanese investors. These real estate holdings as well as American aid such as the China Aid Act and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction helped to ensure that Taiwan would recover quickly from war. The Kuomintang government also moved the entire <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, and used this reserve to back the newly issued New Taiwan dollar to stabilize the new currency and {{put a stop to}} hyperinflation.|$|E

50|$|Currency {{reserves}} are all {{assets of the}} Bundesbank that are not specified in EUR, including <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> securities in foreign currency, credit with foreign banks, foreign exchange, etc. Currency reserves can be invested for profit and also provide a possibility of intervening in the market if the exchange rate fluctuates strongly. The <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> of the Bundesbank are the second {{largest in the world}} (after the U.S Federal Reserve). As of late 2011, the Bundesbank has over 3,000 tonnes of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1934, {{the lease}} amount that {{formerly}} was paid in gold coin was instead paid with U.S. dollars per the <b>Gold</b> <b>Reserve</b> Act {{so it was}} adjusted {{to account for the}} value of gold into U.S. dollars, which set it at $3,386.25. The lease amount was further adjusted in 1973 to $3,676.50 and in 1974 to $4,085, based on revisions to the value of the U.S. gold dollar. Payments have been sent annually, but only one lease payment has been cashed since the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro claimed that this check was deposited due to confusion in 1959, and the Cuban government has not deposited any other lease checks.|$|E
25|$|For foreign {{exchange}} purposes, the set $20.67 per ounce {{value of the}} dollar was lifted, allowing the dollar to float freely in {{foreign exchange}} markets with no set value in gold. This was terminated after one year. Roosevelt attempted first to restabilize falling prices with the Agricultural Adjustment Act; however, this did not prove popular, so instead the next politically popular option was to devalue the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Under the <b>Gold</b> <b>Reserve</b> Act the value of gold was fixed at $35 per ounce, making the dollar more attractive for foreign buyers (and making foreign currencies more expensive for those holding dollars). This change led to more conversion of gold into dollars, allowing the U.S. to effectively corner the world gold market.|$|E
25|$|Today Italy has {{the third}} largest nominal GDP in the Eurozone and the eighth largest in the world. As an {{advanced}} economy the country also has the sixth worldwide national wealth and it is ranked third for its central bank <b>gold</b> <b>reserve.</b> Italy has {{a very high level}} of human development and it is sixth in the world for life expectancy. The country plays a prominent role in regional and global economic, military, cultural and diplomatic affairs, and it is both a regional power and a great power. Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the member of numerous international institutions, including the UN, NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the WTO, the G7, G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Council of Europe, Uniting for Consensus and many more. As a reflection of its cultural wealth, Italy is home to 53 World Heritage Sites, the most in the world, and is the fifth most visited country.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we explore}} the {{determinants}} of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> by central banks of Group of Seven (G- 7) countries. They are also the suppliers of key currencies. We analyse a sample spanning 24 years period from 1990 to 2014, using panel regression model. Firstly, we compare the patterns of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> in the central banks of G 7 with {{the determinants of}} their central banks’ total reserves, and also with non-gold international reserves. We find that the factors that affect <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> are utterly different from other two models. Secondly, we show that an increase in G- 7 countries’ GDP, and also in their exports of goods and services, have positive and significant effects on <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> while Population, Net FDI Liabilities, and Current Account Balance have negative effects on it. Finally, we predict that high economic growth and rising exports and services of G- 7 {{are more likely to}} lead to an increase in their <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> which are effecting 64 % of net global wealth...|$|R

25|$|At first, Lithuania did {{not have}} gold or any other {{securities}} {{to back up the}} litas. Lithuania needed to find about 200 million U.S. dollars to form the stabilization fund. First, it sought to recover its pre-war gold reserves (about 10 tons) from France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, etc. In the interwar period Lithuania stored its <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> in foreign banks. After the occupation in 1940 those reserves were “nobody’s”: there was no Lithuania and most Western countries condemned the occupation as illegal and did not recognize the Soviet Union as a successor. The Bank of England, for example, sold the reserves to the Soviets in 1967. However, in January 1992 it announced that this action was a “betrayal {{of the people of the}} Baltic states” and that it would return the originally deposited amount of gold, now worth about 90 million pounds sterling, to the three Baltic states. Lithuania received 18.5 million pounds or 95,000 ounces of gold and remained a customer of the bank. Similarly, in March 1992 Lithuania reclaimed gold from the Bank of France and later from the Bank of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Lacking a <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> {{to back up}} the Republican banknotes, {{and already}} {{suffering}} from significant devaluation, the Government of the Republic began to issue increasing quantities of banknotes with no backing in gold or silver, thereby increasing the overall paper money in circulation. By April 30, 1938, the number of new banknotes in circulation in Republican-controlled areas was calculated to be 12,754 million pesetas, an increment of 265.8% with respect to the 3,486 million of July 17, 1936; by then 2,650 million were in circulation in the Nationalist-controlled territory, in contrast to the approximately 2,000 million of July 1936. These actions caused massive inflation, and led to the amassment of precious metals by the population. While prices increased by 40% in the Nationalist areas, they skyrocketed by up to 1500% in the Republican-controlled areas. Metallic coins began to disappear and were replaced by paper or cardboard circles. Transactions with Republican banknotes became undesirable, as such notes were already highly devalued, and it was further known that, if Franco were to win the War, those banknotes would lose their full value, since they were all newly-issued series placed in circulation {{from the start of the}} War (June 1936) onwards. The State was unable to effectively respond to the lack of metallic currency, causing town halls and other local institutions to print their own provisional bonds, some of which were rejected in neighbouring municipalities.|$|E
500|$|A 30-minute {{episode of}} the Swedish public {{broadcaster}} SVT's series Hemliga svenska rum ("Secret Swedish spaces") covered Boden Fortress and its secrets, lesser known facts and myths.

50|$|Official {{international}} reserves, {{the means}} of official international payments, formerly consisted only of gold, and occasionally silver. But under the Bretton Woods system, the US dollar functioned as a reserve currency, so it too became part of a nation's official international reserve assets. From 1944-1968, the US dollar was convertible into gold through the Federal Reserve System, but after 1968 only central banks could convert dollars into gold from official <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> and after 1973 no individual or institution could convert US dollars into gold from official <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b> Since 1973, no major currencies have been convertible into gold from official <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b> Individuals and institutions must now buy gold in private markets, just like other commodities. Even though US dollars and other currencies are no longer convertible into gold from official <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> they still can function as official international reserves.|$|R

500|$|Degerberget Fort (...) {{was planned}} and {{constructed}} on Degerberget Mountain, north of Boden {{and west of}} the lake Buddbyträsket, between 1900 and 1908. It was the only fort in the northern fort group as defined in the 1914 defensive plans for Boden Fortress. The main artillery consisted of four [...] kanon m/99, backed up by another four [...] kanon m/94-04 which were replaced by 8.4cm kanon m/47 in the early 1950s. Surrounded by a caponier ditch on all sides, the fort area also features one observation post, two searchlight sites and two larger bunkers. Part of the Swedish <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> was kept here from 1941 to 1982. Degerberget Fort was decommissioned in 1992 together with Gammelängsberget Fort.|$|E

These battleships' fast speed would make them suitable for opposing the new Argentine armored cruisers. The Chileans also purchased the protected cruiser , which had been built on speculation, on the stocks in late 1901. The Argentines responded in May 1901 with an inquiry, possibly a full order, to Ansaldo for a new [...] battleship design. This would mount a [...] main battery and be capable of steaming at [...]|$|E
500|$|Turkey was neutral {{during much}} of World War II, {{although}} in October 1939, Britain signed a treaty to protect Turkey should Germany attack them. It maintained its neutrality by preventing German troops from crossing its borders into Syria or the USSR. During this time, Turkey had lucrative trade relationships with Germany and Britain. Germany had significant business interests in Turkey, including banks, and beginning in 1941 was reliant on chromite ore from Turkey for its armament production. In 1943, all of the chromite ore Germany imported for its weaponry came from Turkey. Throughout the war, Turkey's economy was reliant and prospered {{by virtue of its}} affiliation with both the Allied and the Axis powers. As a result, Turkey's <b>gold</b> <b>reserve</b> had risen to 216 tons by the end of 1945, from 27 tons {{at the beginning of the}} war.|$|E

The ships arrived on 17 December and covered a troop convoy on the return voyage. After returning to Brest on 4 January 1940, Dunkerque underwent another period of maintenance, which lasted until 6 February. The ship then conducted sea trials and training maneuvers through March.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the strict}} {{security}} surrounding the garrison, many rumours circulated during the fortress' lifetime. Some were later dismissed as myths or as disinformation, but others were confirmed. One common rumour {{was that the}} artillery of the main forts had a range of fire {{that made it possible}} to shoot at the important Luleå harbour more than [...] away, but in reality, the maximum range of the farthest shooting pieces was less than half of that. Another widespread myth was that all the forts were connected to each other with a complex system of tunnels beneath the city. However, one has been confirmed, that the forts were used as storage for {{a large part of the}} Swedish <b>gold</b> <b>reserve.</b> Around a third of the total Swedish gold holdings of [...] was kept in Degerberget Fort from 1941transported there disguised as boxes of ammunitionuntil the last ingots were brought from the fort by six armoured cars in 1982 as the fort no longer was to have around-the-clock surveillance.|$|E
500|$|Less than a {{month after}} being commissioned, Beograd was sent to the United Kingdom with a large part of Yugoslavia's <b>gold</b> <b>reserve,</b> 7,344 ingots, to be lodged with the Bank of England for safekeeping. At the time of the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Beograd and her sister ships were allocated to the 1st Torpedo Division at the Bay of Kotor. When the invasion commenced, to prevent a bridgehead being established at Zara, an Italian enclave on the Dalmatian coast, Beograd, four 250t-class torpedo boats and six motor torpedo boats were dispatched to Šibenik, [...] to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the 12th Infantry Division Jadranska and two combined regiments (...) of the Royal Yugoslav Army attacking from the Benkovac area, supported by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force's 81st Bomber Group. The Yugoslavs launched their attack on 9 April, but the naval prong of the attack faltered when Beograds starboard engine was put out of action after a series of near misses from Italian aircraft off Šibenik. The destroyer then limped to the Bay of Kotor for repairs, escorted by the remainder of the force. She was captured there by Italian forces on 17 April.|$|E
