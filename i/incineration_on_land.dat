40|$|Heat pumps play an {{important}} role in Swedish district heating systems. Various policy instruments currently introduced, for example tradable emission permits, tradable green certificates and the ban <b>on</b> <b>land</b> filling of combustible waste will have an impact on the role of heat pumps in district heating systems. In this paper, a case study of a district heating system is performed to analyze how the heat production of an existing heat pump and the possibilities to reinvest in a new heat pump if the existing is phased out is changed due to waste incineration. Results are obtained for several scenarios of policy instruments. In most scenarios used in the study, waste incineration will reduce the heat production from the heat pump. However, in some cases, waste incineration replaces an investment in combined heat and power that would have reduced the heat pump even more, thus the results indicate that the impact of waste <b>incineration</b> <b>on</b> heat pumps is ambiguous...|$|R

Airborne particulates have been sampled {{during the night}} {{over a period of}} two and a half week. The samples have been analysed for lead, copper, cadmium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Likewise local air has been investigated for volatile organic components. In addition some gras and soil samples have been analysed for lead, copper, cadmium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as apples grown in the neighbourhood of the incineration site. Lastly the soil samples have been analysed for antimony also. Only one of the soil samples turned out to be polluted with lead and copper and at a lower level also with cadmium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The antimony content of this sample is also relatively high. It is unlikely that air transport will be the cause of this pollution. ...|$|R

The ash volume increases with the residues incineration and the metals contaminants present in the residues are a great source of environmental contaminations. The principal objective of this paper is to alert to the contaminations possibilities related to the residues burned in the clincker furnaces. One example is the used tires, which can be permanents sources of environmental contaminations and of the own produced cement...|$|R

A main and standby powerhouse provide electricity and reticulated heating water via a heat exchanger on the diesel generators. Water is sourced from a dam at the top of Gadget's Gully and piped to storage tanks at the station. Sewage is treated before discharge and garbage is sorted for recycling (back in Hobart) or <b>incineration</b> <b>on</b> site. Scientific facilities exist in the Biology Building, Physics Building and Bureau of Meteorology buildings.
