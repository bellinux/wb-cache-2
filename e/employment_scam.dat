50|$|More {{sophisticated}} scams advertise {{jobs with}} real companies and offer lucrative salaries and conditions with the fraudsters {{pretending to be}} recruitment agents. A bogus telephone or online interview may take place and after some time the applicant is informed that the job is theirs. To secure the job they are instructed to send money for their work visa or travel costs to the agent, or to a bogus travel agent who works on the scammer's behalf. No matter what the variation, they always involve the job seeker sending them or their agent money, credit card or bank account details. A newer form of <b>employment</b> <b>scam</b> has arisen in which users are sent a bogus job offer, but are not asked to give financial information. Instead, their personal information is harvested during the application process and then sold to third parties for a profit, or used for identity theft.|$|E
5000|$|Another form of <b>employment</b> <b>scam</b> {{involves}} {{making people}} receive a fake [...] "interview" [...] {{where they are}} told {{the benefits of the}} company. The attendees are then made to assist to a conference where a scammer will use elaborate manipulation techniques to convince the attendees to purchase products, in a similar manner to the catalogue merchant business model, as a hiring requisite. Quite often, the company lacks any form of physical catalogue to help them sell products (e.g. jewelry). When [...] "given" [...] the job, the individual is then asked to promote the scam job offer on their own. They are also made to work the company unpaid as a form of [...] "training". Similar scams involve making alleged job candidates pay money upfront in person for training materials or services, with the claim that upon successful completion, they will be offered a guaranteed job, which never materializes.|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} {{process of}} hiring has relatively recently been ported to the cloud. Specifically, the automated systems responsible for completing {{the recruitment of}} new employees in an online fashion, aim to make the hiring process more immediate, accurate and cost-efficient. However, the online exposure of such traditional business procedures has introduced new points of failure {{that may lead to}} privacy loss for applicants and harm the reputation of organizations. So far, the most common case of Online Recruitment Frauds (ORF), is <b>employment</b> <b>scam.</b> Unlike relevant online fraud problems, the tackling of ORF has not yet received the proper attention, remaining largely unexplored until now. Responding to this need, the work at hand defines and describes the characteristics of this severe and timely novel cyber security research topic. At the same time, it contributes and evaluates the first to our knowledge publicly available dataset of 17, 880 annotated job ads, retrieved from the use of a real-life system...|$|E
50|$|E-commerce {{cheating}} cases {{increased by}} about 30 per cent between 2014 and 2015. Noted concerns as of 2016 may also include impersonation and <b>employment</b> <b>scams.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} on the most common stories, and also many {{variations on the}} way the scam works. Some of the more commonly seen variants involve <b>employment</b> <b>scams,</b> lottery scams, online sales and rentals, and romance scams. Many scams involve online sales, such as those advertised on websites such as Craigslist and eBay, or property rental.

50|$|The {{government}} sustained {{its previous}} level of anti-trafficking awareness raising efforts in 2007. There {{is a general}} lack of understanding about trafficking across government agencies, especially at the local level. However, senior government officials have frequently spoken about the dangers of trafficking and illegal migration, and the state-run media has printed and aired warnings about false <b>employment</b> <b>scams</b> and exploitative labor conditions. During 2007, all four government-controlled radio stations aired an IOM public service announcement eight times each day in five languages during peak migration periods. In January 2008, the government signed a memorandum of understanding with the South African government for a joint project to regularize the status of illegal Zimbabwean migrant farm workers in South Africa's Limpopo Province and ensure them proper employment conditions. The inter-ministerial anti-trafficking taskforce took no concrete action during 2007. As of early 2008, information was unavailable regarding measures adopted by the government to ensure its nationals deployed to peacekeeping missions do not facilitate or engage in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has not ratified the 2000 UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol.|$|R
50|$|Identity theft {{is a form}} {{of fraud}} or {{cheating}} of another person's identity in which someone pretends to be someone else by assuming that person's identity, typically in order to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits in that person's name. Victims of identity theft (those whose identity has been assumed by the identity thief) can suffer adverse consequences if held accountable for the perpetrator's actions, as can organizations and individuals who are defrauded by the identity thief, and to that extent are also victims. Internet fraud refers to the actual use of Internet services to present fraudulent solicitations to prospective victims, to conduct fraudulent transactions, or to transmit the proceeds of fraud to financial institutions or to others connected with the scheme. In the context of organized crime, both may serve as means through which other criminal activity may be successfully perpetrated or as the primary goal themselves. Email fraud, advance-fee fraud, romance <b>scams,</b> <b>employment</b> <b>scams,</b> and other phishing scams are the most common and most widely used forms of identity theft, though with the advent of social networking fake websites, accounts and other fraudulent or deceitful activity has become commonplace.|$|R
40|$|This report {{explains}} key {{trends in}} scam activity in 2012 and highlights {{the impact of}} scams on the community. Snapshot of 2012 Scam reports 	In 2012 the ACCC continued to observe {{a high level of}} scams activity in Australia, with 83 803 scam-related contacts received from consumers and small businesses. 	Estimated scam losses reported to the ACCC totalled $ 93 423 030, a nine per cent increase from 2011. Actual losses are likely to be higher as many scams go unreported and the ACCC is only one of several agencies that receive scam reports. 	Similar to 2011, the majority of consumers and small businesses contacting the ACCC about scam-related activities in 2012 (nearly 88 per cent) reported no financial loss. The most common category of loss was again between $ 100 to $ 499. This indicates the continued use of ‘high volume scams’, which are delivered to large numbers of recipients but cause smaller amounts of loss per victim. At the same time, the ACCC continued to receive reports of individuals suffering very high losses. Most reported scams 	For the fourth consecutive year, advance fee/up-front payment scams were the most commonly reported scam type, constituting 32 per cent of all scam contacts. 	Computer hacking remained the second most reported scam type in 2012, representing just over 13 per cent of total scam reports to the ACCC. The ‘Microsoft’ computer virus scam continued to heavily target Australians. The public was also targeted by a scareware scam where the perpetrators pretended to be from the Australian Federal Police. 	Online shopping scams increased by 65 per cent with reported financial losses totalling $ 4, 038, 479. 	The ACCC also received a high level of contacts about banking and online account scams, false billing, job and <b>employment</b> <b>scams,</b> dating and romance, and unexpected prize scams. Age range and location demographics 	In 2012 scams were most commonly reported by persons in the 35 to 44 age category, representing 32 per cent of contacts. This saw a shift from the previous year, where contacts were spread across a wider range of age from 25 through to 54 years. 	The greatest amounts of scam reports to the ACCC came from New South Wales (23. 5 per cent), Queensland (21 per cent), Victoria (18 per cent) and South Australia (12. 5 per cent). Scam delivery method 	Scams delivered via telephone (landline and mobile) remained the preferred delivery method in 2012, with combined voice and text message scams constituting over half (56 per cent) of all reports to the ACCC. Unsolicited telephone calls represented just over 42 per cent (35 419) of contacts reported to the ACCC, accounting for $ 24 213 979 in reported losses. Scams delivered via SMS represented over 14 per cent (11 797) of total contacts and $ 759 986 in reported losses...|$|R
50|$|In Pradeep Majhi's stints as {{president}} of Orissa Youth Congress, he has attempted with his hard work and commitment {{to bring back the}} faith among young congress members when Orissa congress was going through a hard period. A huge number of fresh young bloods had been injected in party via talent hunt programs conducted across the state. He has dared the Orissa ruling Naveen Patnaik government over the huge Mahatma Gandhi National Rural <b>Employment</b> Guarantee Act <b>scam.</b> He has also launched a Hunger strike near the state secretariat with his supporters seeking loan waiver for small and marginal farmers hit by nonseasonal rain. Then the hunger strike was called off after 7 days. On the sixth day of the stir six leaders including Majhi were shifted to the Capital Hospital there after their condition deteriorated. The Capital Hospital's Causality ward was crowded with many Congress leaders and workers to inquire about their health condition.|$|R
