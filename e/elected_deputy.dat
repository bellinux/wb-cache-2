5|$|Alfonsín was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> for the {{legislature}} of the Buenos Aires province in 1958, on the UCRP ticket, and was reelected in 1962. He moved to La Plata, {{capital of the}} province, during his tenure. President Frondizi was ousted by a military coup on 29 March 1962, which also closed the provincial legislature. Alfonsín returned to Chascomús. The UCRP prevailed over the UCRI the following year, leading to the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. Alfonsín was elected a national deputy, and then {{vice president of the}} UCRP bloc in the congress. In 1963 he was appointed president of the party committee for the province of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> for {{the provincial}} {{legislature}} of Santa Cruz in 1989. The Justicialist Party (PJ), led by Carlos Menem, {{returned to the}} presidency in the 1989 general elections. She served as interim governor of Santa Cruz {{for a couple of}} days, after the impeachment of Ricardo del Val in 1990. She organized Néstor's political campaign when he was elected governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. In 1994, she was elected to the constituent assembly that amended the Constitution of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Endecott was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> {{governor}} in 1641 {{and in this}} role {{was one of the}} signatories to the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, which enumerated a number of individual rights available to all colonists, and presaged the United States Bill of Rights. The next few years were quiet, although rumors of war with the Indians led to the formation in 1643 of the New England Confederation, designed to facilitate united action by the New England colonies against common external threats as well as internal matters like dealing with escaped slaves and fugitives from justice.|$|E

5|$|In opposition, Weaver {{witnessed}} {{the end of}} the Nationalist Party and was <b>elected</b> <b>Deputy</b> Leader of the new United Australia Party (UAP) in New South Wales in 1931. When Lang's Government was dismissed on 13 May 1932 by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game, an early election was called by caretaker-Premier and UAP Leader, Bertram Stevens. At the 11 June 1932 election, in which Weaver was returned with 80.70%, Stevens' UAP/Country Coalition gained 31 seats and won government. Stevens had already appointed Weaver as the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Health on 16 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet-German {{relations}} until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned {{east and}} attacked the Soviet Union. Molotov {{was responsible for}} telling the Soviet people of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war. His speech, broadcast by radio on 22 June, characterised the Soviet Union in a role similar to that articulated for Britain by Winston Churchill in his early wartime speeches. The State Defence Committee was established soon after Molotov's speech; Stalin was elected chairman and Molotov was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> chairman.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Fisher {{was elected}} to the new federal {{parliament}} representing the Division of Wide Bay. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs for a few months in 1904, in the short-lived government of Chris Watson. Fisher was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> leader of the Labor Party in 1905, and replaced Watson as leader in 1907. At the time, Labor supported the Protectionist Party minority government of Alfred Deakin. Deakin resigned as prime minister in November 1908 after Labor withdrew their support, and Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own. It lasted only a few months, as in June 1909 Deakin returned as prime minister {{at the head of the}} new Commonwealth Liberal Party (a merger of the Protectionists and the Anti-Socialist Party).|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko was <b>elected</b> <b>Deputy</b> to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He was {{the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905. During his tenure, he was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> speaker and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education. His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend {{the boundaries of the}} Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works. He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E
5|$|Illia was deposed {{by a new}} {{military}} coup in June 1966, the Argentine Revolution. Alfonsín was detained while trying to hold a political rally in La Plata, and a second time {{when he tried to}} re-open the UCRP committee. He was forced to resign as deputy in November 1966. He was detained a third time in 1968 after a political rally in La Plata. He also wrote opinion articles in newspapers, under the pseudonyms Alfonso Carrido Lura and Serafín Feijó. The Dirty War began during this time, as many guerrilla groups rejected both the right-wing military dictatorship and the civil governments, preferring instead a left-wing dictatorship aligned with the Soviet Union, as in the Cuban Revolution. Alfonsín clarified in his articles that he rejected both the military dictatorship and the guerrillas, asking instead for free elections. The UCRP became the UCR once more; and the UCRI was turned into the Intransigent Party. Alfonsín created the Movement for Renewal and Change within the UCR, to challenge Balbín's leadership of the party. The military dictatorship finally called for free elections, allowing Peronism (which had been banned since 1955) to take part in them. Balbín defeated Alfonsín in the primary elections, but lost in the main ones. Alfonsín was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> once more.|$|E

5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{ended in}} 1983. De la Rúa {{intended}} {{to run for}} president but lost in the primary elections of the UCR to Raúl Alfonsín, who was elected in the general election. De la Rúa ran for the post of senator instead, defeating the Peronist Carlos Ruckauf. He ran for re-election as senator in 1989 but, despite of his electoral victory, the electoral college voted for the Peronist Eduardo Vaca. De la Rúa was <b>elected</b> <b>deputy</b> in 1991 and returned to the senate in 1993. President Carlos Menem, elected in 1989, wanted to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election in 1995, which was opposed by the UCR. Alfonsín signed the Pact of Olivos with Menem, negotiating terms to support the proposal. De la Rúa led the opposition to the pact within the UCR, but Alfonsín prevailed in the internal dispute. This damaged the relationship between both leaders, but helped the party to retain a number of radicals who were against the pact. De la Rúa could not prevent the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. As a result, Menem was re-elected in 1995. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time, being surpassed by the Frepaso, a new party composed by former Peronists.|$|E
