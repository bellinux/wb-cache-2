40|$|What {{drives the}} intraday {{patterns}} of settlement in payment and securities settlement systems? Using {{a model of}} the strategic interaction of participants in these systems to capture some stylized facts about the Federal Reserve's Fedwire funds and securities systems, this paper identifies three factors that influence a participant's decision on when to send transactions intraday: cost of intraday liquidity, extent of settlement risk, and system design. With these factors, the model can make predictions regarding the impact of policy on the concentration of transactions, amount of <b>intraday</b> <b>overdrafts,</b> central bank credit exposure, costs to system participants, and other risks. ...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis 2007 – 2008, financial markets and infrastructures have been receiving great amounts of attention. At the cores are payment and financial transactions, on which all economic activities are established. Modern technology developments {{have made it possible}} for the payments processing to improve. The achievement is significant since values and risks of wholesale payments are very large, and any failure might have potentially severe impacts on systems as a whole. However, banks and central banks are engaged with new tasks of managing settlement liquidity. Liquidity has its costs and risks. The aim of this thesis is to study alternative liquidity policies for Norges Bank, in respect of Norway’s settlement system NBO, together with {{the financial}} stability and the inflation target. The problems to be analyzed are should Norges Bank publicly supply intraday liquidity or let a private sector intraday market performs, and whether it is more efficient to charge a fee on <b>intraday</b> <b>overdrafts</b> or to provide free intraday credits against collaterals. The purpose is to promote efficiencies in the interbank systems, and thus the public economy, whilst interacting with homo-economicus banks, that maximize profits and have moral hazard in debt repayments. It is a game played between banks and the central bank...|$|R
40|$|Properly {{designed}} wholesale payments {{system can}} make {{a significant contribution to}} enhancing market discipline in the financial sector, reducing the risk of systemic disturbance and permitting a less extensive safety net for financial institutions. The objective of these reforms has been to achieve a reduction of the credit risk associated with the growth in intraday credit exposures that arises in net settlement systems and in real-time gross systems when the central bank provides daylight <b>overdrafts.</b> <b>Intraday</b> payments-related credit in net settlement systems has been reduced by restructuring payment systems into real-time gross settlement systems with collateralized overdrafts, while in the existing real-time gross settlement systems, the risk-abatement program currently in effect has taken the form of caps and charges on uncollateralized daylight credit. ...|$|R

One striking feature of central bank deposits, as opposed to central bank note issue, is that their predomi [...] ...|$|E
