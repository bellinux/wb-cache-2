5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April.

The eggs develop <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bright orange colour to a dark brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development.

5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër went <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> predominantly Christian city to one with a Muslim majority due {{to much of the}} urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E

The group was the first Spanish-language act to record in Marley's studios. The record discusses a number of social issues in Puerto Rico, including the importance of acknowledging the island's African influence.|$|E
5|$|After winning all the breaststroke {{events at}} the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole. Carlile was {{regarded}} as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program {{while he was in}} the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.|$|E

Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E

5|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} moved away <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, {{along with the}} need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E
5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
