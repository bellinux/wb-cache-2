25|$|In the 1980s, {{advances}} {{were made}} in molecular cytogenetics. While radioisotope-labeled probes had been hybridized with DNA since 1969, movement was now made in using fluorescent labeled probes. Hybridizing them to chromosomal preparations using <b>existing</b> <b>techniques</b> {{came to be known}} as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This change significantly increased the usage of probing techniques as fluorescent labeled probes are safer. Further advances in micromanipulation and examination of chromosomes led to the technique of chromosome microdissection whereby aberrations in chromosomal structure could be isolated, cloned and studied in ever greater detail.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, woodcut is {{the oldest}} {{technique}} used for old master prints, developing about 1400, by using on paper <b>existing</b> <b>techniques</b> for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts {{in the middle of}} the century led to a fall in standards, and many popular prints were very crude. The development of hatching followed on rather later than in engraving. Michael Wolgemut was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to do than in engraving or etching). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century Albrecht Dürer brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the single-leaf (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.|$|E

40|$|Class {{diagrams}} {{are among}} the most widely used object-oriented design techniques. They are effective in modeling the structure of software systems at any stages of the software life cycle. Still, class diagrams can become as complex and overwhelming as the software systems they describe. This paper describes a technique for abstracting lower-level class structures into higherlevel ones by `collapsing' lower-level class patterns into single, higher-level classes and relationships. This paper is an extension to an <b>existing</b> <b>technique</b> that re-interprets the transitive meaning of lower-level classes into higher-level relationships (relational reasoning). The <b>existing</b> <b>technique</b> is briefly summarized...|$|R
2500|$|A 2007 joint {{study by}} the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) {{similarly}} found that the introduction of PHEVs into America’s consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions. The EPRI-NRDC report estimates that, between 2010 and 2050, a shift toward PHEV use could reduce GHG emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons. The magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend {{on the level of}} PHEV market penetration and the carbon intensity of the US electricity sector. In general, PHEVs can be viewed as an element in the [...] "Pacala and Socolow wedges" [...] approach which shows a way to stabilize [...] emissions using a portfolio of <b>existing</b> <b>techniques,</b> including efficient vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|... von Clausewitz and Napoleon Bonaparte {{considered}} {{him one of}} the greatest generals of all time, an evaluation agreed with by George S. Patton and others. He was also renowned for his constancy of purpose and the equality of his troops—no one part of his armies was considered better or received preferred treatment, as was common in other armies where the cavalry were the elite, followed by the artillery, and both disdained the lowly infantry. In Gustavus' army the units were extensively cross trained. Both cavalry and infantry could service the artillery, as his heavy cavalry did when turning captured artillery on the opposing Catholic Tercios at First Breitenfeld. Pikemen could shoot—if not as accurately as those designated musketeers—so a valuable firearm could be kept in the firing line. His infantrymen and gunners were taught to ride, if needed. Napoleon thought highly of the achievement, and copied the tactics. However, recent historians have challenged velocity reputation. B. H. Liddell Hart says it is an exaggeration to credit him with a uniquely disciplined conscript army, or call his the first military state to fight a protracted war on the continent. He argues that he improved <b>existing</b> <b>techniques</b> and used them brilliantly. Richard Brzezinski says his legendary status was based on inaccurate myths created by later historians. Many of his innovations were developed by his senior staff.|$|E

Our method focuses on transferring raw video data (pixels) between off-chip memory and on-chip memory which {{is common in}} video compression applications.

40|$|Security {{is the one}} of {{the major}} issue that exists in Mobile Ad hoc network. Mobile Ad hoc network is {{infrastructure}} less network so it is vulnerable to several security attacks that are on different layers. Wormhole attack is one of the serious routing attack on network layer. This paper focuses on the wormhole attack. The application of multi-path techniques in wireless ad hoc networks is natural, as multi-path routing (MR) allows diminishing the effect of unreliable wireless links and the constantly changing network topology. In this paper we have used multipath scheme for detection and prevention of Wormhole attack. This approach is an improvement over the <b>existing</b> <b>technique</b> and the simulation results of proposed technique show better performance in comparison to the <b>existing</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|R
