5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in <b>emergency</b> <b>circumstances)</b> and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain <b>emergency</b> <b>circumstances</b> (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

Methods: we report a case of an aorto-caval fistula endovascular repaired in a 78 -year-old male using a hybrid stent-graft technique.

A careful error analysis of the panoramic stereo triangulation is presented in order to derive rules for optimal view planning.

The statistical analysis were Chi Square test and logistic regression model with the statistical significance if p-value < 0. 05 demonstrated in Odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval. Results: From the 7, 430 patients, there were 63 patients (0. 85 %) with perioperative cardiovascular compli-cation.
