5000|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} the space-charge tetrode was as an electrometer tube for detecting and measuring extremely small currents. For example, the General Electric FP54 {{was described as a}} [...] "space-charge <b>grid</b> <b>tube</b> ... designed to have a very high input impedance and a very low grid current. It is designed particularly for amplification of direct currents smaller than about 10 amperes, and has been found capable of measuring currents as small as 5 x 10 amperes. It has a current amplification factor of 250,000, and operates with an anode voltage of 12v, and space-charge grid voltage of +4V." [...] The mechanism by which the space-charge grid lowers control-grid current in an electrometer tetrode is that it prevents positive ions originating in the cathode from reaching the control grid.|$|E
50|$|The tetrode was {{developed}} in the 1920s by adding an additional grid to the first amplifying vacuum tube, the triode, to correct limitations of the triode. During the period 1913 to 1927, three distinct types of tetrode valves appeared. All had a normal control grid whose function was to act as a primary control for current passing through the tube, but they differed according to the intended function of the other grid. In order of historical appearance these are: the space-charge <b>grid</b> <b>tube,</b> the bi-grid valve, and the screen-grid tube. The last of these appeared in two distinct variants with different areas of application: the screen-grid valve proper, which was used for medium-frequency, small signal amplification, and the beam tetrode which appeared later, and was used for audio or radio-frequency power amplification. The former was quickly superseded by the rf pentode, while the latter was initially developed {{as an alternative to the}} pentode as an audio power amplifying device. The beam tetrode was also developed as a high power radio transmitting tube.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a high {{resolution}} X-ray simulation source is proposed {{and designed to}} verify the navigation based on X-ray pulsar in the simulation experience system. The simulation source consists of an arbitrary signal generator and a <b>grid</b> controlled X-ray <b>tube.</b> According to the <b>grid</b> <b>tube's</b> characteristic curve, the data of the pulsar standard pulse template are converted. Then using the method of direct digital frequency synthesis, the converted data are synthesized to waveforms, called the analog modulated grid voltage. In the <b>grid</b> controlled X-ray <b>tube,</b> the <b>grid</b> voltage changes the number of electrons hitting on the target and controls the X-ray intensity. With an analog modulated pulse profile applied on the <b>tube</b> <b>grid</b> electrode, the <b>tube</b> will emit X-rays which will match photons' statistical distribution and simulate the X-ray pulsar profile extremely well. The properties of Crab pulsar simulation source are tested in X-ray pulsar navigation simulation experience system. The results of the test are as follows: Comparing the tested pulse profile with the standard pulsar profile, we have time correlation coefficient is 0. 9774, and frequency correlation coefficient is 0. 9853. The X-ray photon flux is 1. 90 ph. cm(- 2). s(- 1), the pulsed fraction is 76. 15 %, and the half-width half maximum is 1. 879 ms. These {{results show that the}} X-ray simulation source has several merits, such as: strong ability to simulate the X-ray, low cost and simple operation. So it is an important means for the improvement of X-ray pulsar navigation...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "ionocraft" [...] {{dates back}} to the 1960s, an era in which EHD {{experiments}} were at their peak. In its basic form, it simply consists of two parallel conductive electrodes, one {{in the form of a}} fine wire and another which may be formed out of wire <b>grid,</b> <b>tubes</b> or foil skirts with a smooth round surface. When such an arrangement is powered by high voltage (in the range of a few kilovolts), it produces thrust. The ionocraft forms part of the EHD thruster family, but is a special case in which the ionisation and accelerating stages are combined into a single stage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{space charge}} <b>grid</b> <b>tube</b> {{was the first}} type of tetrode to appear. In {{the course of his}} {{research}} into the action of the [...] "audion" [...] triode tube of Lee de Forest, Irving Langmuir found that the action of the heated thermionic cathode was to create a space charge, or cloud of electrons, around the cathode. This cloud acted as a virtual cathode. With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the space charge returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the electric field due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it. However, if a grid bearing a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode. This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge. Firstly, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage. Secondly the transconductance (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly important since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.|$|E
40|$|Theoretically {{a modern}} screen <b>grid</b> <b>tube</b> will amplify about 400 times, but in {{practice}} the average amplification obtained is about 40 or less. The purpose of this work {{was an attempt to}} obtain a greater prac-tical amplification with the screen <b>grid</b> <b>tube.</b> The amplification is defined as the ratio of the change of plate voltage to the change in grid voltage which produces the change in the plate voltage. This will be worked out from the plate current plate voltage or {{what is known as the}} plate characteristic curve Figure 1. The direct current resistance of the tube is Ep/Tp and the alternating cur-rent resistance is dEp/dlp If the lines were straight and parallel the direct and alternating current resistance would be the same. Since the curves are neither straight nor parallel the plate resistance of the tube to the alternating current will be determined by the position on the curve at which the tube is worked...|$|E

500|$|Originally {{located at}} 79 Washington Street in Brooklyn, New York, Amperex was a {{long-established}} manufacturer of transmitting tubes {{when they were}} acquired by the Dutch firm, Philips, (known more widely as Norelco in the US), around 1955.

40|$|As an {{autonomous}} navigation method, X-ray pulsar navigation can provide position, timing and attitude information for various spacecrafts. Since the X-rays (1 - 20 keV) from the pulsar can not penetrate the earth atmosphere, an X-ray source in laboratory {{needs to be}} set up to test and calibrate the detector. In this paper an arbitrary X-ray pulse source to simulate the neutron pulsar signal is proposed.

Due to its work on broadcast transmission parts, Eimac {{operated a}}n FM radio station, KSBR, which transmitted on 100.5 megahertz. The station began operations in 1947 and, that same year, was one of only two in the nation to test Rangertone tape recorders. (The other station was WASH-FM in Washington, D.C.) The recorders were based on the German Magnetophon. In need of more space, the company moved to San Carlos in 1959. Eimac's San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959. In 1965, Eimac merged with Varian Associates and became known as the Eimac Division. In 1995, Leonard Green & Partners purchased the entire Electron Devices Business from Varian and formed Communications & Power Industries.|$|R

50|$|The Doble Detroit {{incorporated}} key ignition, {{doing away}} {{with the need for}} manual ignition of the boiler system. John Doble also constructed a flash boiler with rectangular casing in which atomized kerosene fuel was ignited with a spark plug, in a carburetor-type venturi and used forced draft provided by an electrically driven fan. This rapidly heated the feedwater contained in vertical <b>grids</b> of <b>tubes</b> welded to horizontal headers. The steam-raising part of the boiler was partitioned off by a wall of heat-resisting material jacketed with planished steel from a smaller compartment in which were similar <b>grids</b> of <b>tubes</b> for feedwater heating. There seem to have been at least two versions of this boiler, the first with the burner and combustion chamber at the bottom, the other with them {{at the top of the}} casing; this led to the subsequent counterflow monotube boiler arrangement. Boiler operation was fully electro-mechanically automated: the bottom of the boiler housed a metal tray with a row of quartz rods. As heat increased, the tray expanded, pushing the rods forward and shutting off the burner. As the system cooled, the quartz rods receded, engaging the burner.|$|R
