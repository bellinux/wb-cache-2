5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic.</b> However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E
5|$|Born in Huyton, Merseyside, Barton is {{the oldest}} of four brothers.

5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded {{the company to}} be the most profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gene Upshaw in 2008, Richard Berthelsen was named interim {{executive}} director, serving from August 2008 until March 2009. The NFLPA Board of Representatives elected DeMaurice Smith for a three-year term as the executive director on March 16, 2009. Smith has been largely praised for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> by the media, current and former players and colleagues as director and for making the union more professional despite the resentment of some players who found his leadership style to be too controlling. Smith's contract was renewed for an additional three years in March 2012. He was elected for a third term in March 2015. The major issue of Smith's tenure has been the 2011 lockout; former offensive lineman Chester Pitts praised Smith for fiercely fighting for the players' rights during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic.</b> A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were an}} actual battle.|$|E

25|$|Around {{this time}} he married the {{well-known}} feminist Elna Sarauw with whom he would have one son. By nature Munch was very introvert, and not one who would easily connect with other people. He insisted on always using the most formal forms of address, and even with friends he didn't use first-names. This is also the reason why he became known only as P. Munch. <b>His</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> was, however, second to none, and his output in terms of books, pamphlets, articles (both academic and for newspapers), letters, diaries and other notes, is immense.|$|E

25|$|Ichiro {{is noted}} for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> in {{arriving}} early for his team's games, {{and for his}} calisthenic stretching exercises to stay limber even {{during the middle of}} the game. Continuing in Seattle the custom he began in Japan, he used his given name (written in Romaji) on the back of his uniform instead of his family name, becoming the first player in Major League Baseball to do so since Vida Blue; the custom was not continued following his trade to the Yankees in 2012, as the Yankees do not include players' names on their jerseys. However, upon joining the Marlins in 2015, he resumed using his given name on the back of his uniform.|$|E

25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. But not one to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E
25|$|During {{his career}} as a mandarin, Di·ªám was reputable for his workaholism and incorruptibility, a Catholic leader and nationalist. Besides, Catholic {{nationalism}} in Vietnam during 1920s and 1930s facilitated Di·ªám's ascent in his bureaucratic career. Di·ªám's rise was also supported through Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i's marriage to the daughter of Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i (1863‚Äì1935), the Catholic head of the Council of Ministers at the Hu·∫ø court and also supported the indigenization of the Vietnamese Church and more administrative powers to the monarchy. Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu B√†i was highly regarded among the French, and Di·ªám's religious and family ties impressed him and he became Di·ªám's patron. The French were impressed by <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> but were irritated by his frequent calls to grant more autonomy to Vietnam. Di·ªám replied that he contemplated resigning but encouragement from the populace convinced him to persist. In 1925, he first encountered communists distributing propaganda while riding horseback through the region near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Revolted by calls for violent socialist revolution contained in the propaganda leaflets, Di·ªám involved himself in anti-communist activities for the first time, printing his own pamphlets.|$|E
