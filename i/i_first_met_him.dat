60|$|At {{the hour}} {{appointed}} he came; {{and as she}} observed before, so it was plain still, {{that he had been}} drinking, though very far from what we call being in drink. He appeared exceeding pleased to see me, and entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair. I begged his pardon very often for my share of it, protested I had not any such design when <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> that I had not gone out with him but that I took him for a very civil gentleman, and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me.|$|R
6000|$|Thy pardon {{for this}} long and tedious case, Which, now that I review it, needs must seem Unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth! Nor I myself discern {{in what is}} writ Good cause for the {{peculiar}} interest And awe indeed this man has touched me with. Perhaps the journey's end, the weariness Had wrought upon me <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> thus: [...] 290 I crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills Like an old lion's cheek teeth. Out there came A moon made like a face with certain spots Multiform, manifold and menacing: Then a wind rose behind me. So we met In this old sleepy town at unaware, The man and I. I send thee what is writ. Regard it as a chance, a matter risked To this ambiguous Syrian--he may lose, Or steal, or give it thee with equal good. [...] 300 Jerusalem's repose shall make amends For time this letter wastes, thy time and mine; Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{and what}} then?' I asked, for Saxon had stopped to light his pipe {{at the same}} old metal tinder-box which he had used when <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> When I picture Saxon to myself it is usually of that moment that I think, when the red glow beat upon his hard, eager, hawk-like face, and showed up the {{thousand}} little seams and wrinkles which time and care had imprinted upon his brown, weather-beaten skin. Sometimes in my dreams that face in the darkness comes back to me, and his half-closed eyelids and shifting, blinky eyes are turned towards me in his sidelong fashion, until I find myself sitting up and holding out my hand into empty space, half expecting to feel another thin sinewy hand close round it. A bad man he was in many ways, my dears, cunning and wily, with little scruple or conscience; and yet so strange a thing is human nature, and so difficult is it for us to control our feelings, that my heart warms when I think of him, and that fifty years have increased rather than weakened the kindliness which I hear to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} seen him when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> mamma. I hardly knew him, he looked so thin and worn; but {{during the last three}} weeks he has filled out again, and he {{seems to me to be}} looking quite himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot quite explain, uncle. To begin with, I don't {{seem to get}} any {{nearer to}} him--I mean to what he really is. I know more of his adventures and his life than I did, but I know no more of him himself than I did three months ago when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at dinner." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{had known}} each other years ago. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> his offices {{consisted}} of a back room up three flights of stairs in a dingy by-street off the Strand, which has since disappeared. We occasionally dined together, in those days, at a restaurant in Great Portland Street, for one and nine. Our acquaintanceship was of sufficient standing to allow of such a question.|$|E
60|$|I shall try {{to write}} simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered my life--how <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> how he grew until I {{became a part of}} him, and the {{tremendous}} changes he wrought in my life. In this way may you look at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him--in all save the things too secret and sweet for me to tell.|$|E
60|$|Algie kicked {{from the}} first. I ought {{to tell you}} that since we left England he has taken up {{painting}} footling little pictures, and has got the artistic temperament badly. All his life he's been starting some new fool thing. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> he prided himself on having the finest collection of photographs of race-horses in England. Then he got a craze for model engines. After that he used to work the piano player till I nearly went crazy. And now it's pictures.|$|E
60|$|He was seized, of course, {{by those}} who <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> and, not being known to them, was at once carried before a captain of dragoons, who knew him.|$|R
2500|$|His {{eyesight}} became worse with age. Boswell <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, {{and noted}} that he had inflamed eyes. In letters written in 1773 Johnson wrote, ...|$|R

6000|$|It was in February, 1912, that <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> when, as a {{guest of}} my father's* at dinner, he came to our house in Berkeley. I cannot say that my very first {{impression}} of him was favorable. He {{was one of many}} at dinner, and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all to arrive, he made a rather incongruous appearance. It was [...] "preacher's night," [...] as my father privately called it, and Ernest was certainly out of place {{in the midst of the}} churchmen.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would not}} suit me," [...] said Olive. [...] "I have waited and waited {{just as long}} as I can. It is as likely as not that he has {{concluded}} that he can not do anything here which will be of service to any one, and has started off to finish his vacation at some place where people won't bother him with their own affairs. He told me when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> that {{he was on his way}} North. And now, would you like me to tell you what I have determined to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{never told}} me," [...] she answered. [...] "He didn't tell me much. But he was very, {{very good to}} me. I was at the refreshment-room at London Bridge when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> He used {{to come in and}} see me every day. Then he began to take me out, and at last he found me a little house down at Putney, and I was so happy. I had been so tired all my life," [...] she added, with a little sigh, [...] "and down there I did nothing but rest and rest and wait for him to come. It was too good to last, of course, but I didn't think it would end like this!" ...|$|E

He hasn't let success give him a swelled head. The money that boy makes is sinful, Mac. He wears thousand dollar bills next to his skin winter and summer. But he's just the same as he was when I first knew him, when he was just hanging around Broadway, looking out for a chance to be allowed to slip a couple of interpolated numbers into any old show that came along. Yes. Put it in your diary, Mac, and write it on your cuff, George Bevan's all right. He's an ace." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found in}} one of my rambles up the hills a real hermit, living in a lonesome spot, hard to get at, rocky, the view fine, with a little patch of land two rods square. A man of youngish middle age, city born and raised, had been to school, had travel'd in Europe and California. <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> once or twice on the road, and pass'd the time of day, with some small talk; then, the third time, he ask'd me to go along a bit and rest in his hut (an almost {{unprecedented}} compliment, as I heard from others afterwards.) He was of Quaker stock, I think; talk'd with ease and moderate freedom, but did not unbosom his life, or story, or tragedy, or whatever it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is very weary. He {{went out}} at half-past four this morning, {{and has been}} working ever since. He cuts furze {{because it is the}} only thing he can do that does not put any strain upon his poor eyes." [...] The {{contrast}} between the sleeper's appearance and Wildeve's at this moment was painfully apparent to Eustacia, Wildeve being elegantly dressed in a new summer suit and light hat; and she continued: [...] "Ah! you don't know how differently he appeared when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> though it is such a little while ago. His hands were as white and soft as mine; and look at them now, how rough and brown they are! His complexion is by nature fair, and that rusty look he has now, all of a colour with his leather clothes, is caused by the burning of the sun." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{talked about}} other matters and {{presently}} Crestwick came in, smartly dressed and looking remarkably vigorous and clear-skinned. There were many points {{of difference between}} his appearance now and when Lisle had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Keeler was {{a native}} of Ohio, and there lived at Cambridge when I first came there an Indianian, more {{accepted}} by literary society, who was of real quality as a poet. Forceythe Willson, whose poem of [...] "The Old Sergeant" [...] Doctor Holmes used to read publicly in the closing year of the civil war, was of a Western altitude of figure, and of an extraordinary beauty of face in an oriental sort. He had large, dark eyes with clouded whites; his full, silken beard was of a flashing Persian blackness. He was excessively nervous, to such an extreme that when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at Longfellow's, he could not hold himself still in his chair. I think this was an effect of shyness in him, as well as physical, for afterwards when I went to find him in his own house he was much more at ease.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> on Market Street in San Francisco. It was a wet and drizzly afternoon, {{and he was}} striding along, clad {{solely in}} a pair of {{abbreviated}} knee-trousers and an abbreviated shirt, his bare feet going slick-slick through the pavement-slush. At his heels trooped a score of excited gamins. Every head--and there were thousands-- turned to glance curiously at him as he went by. And I turned, too. Never had I seen such lovely sunburn. He was all sunburn, of the sort a blond takes on when his skin does not peel. His long yellow hair was burnt, so was his beard, which sprang from a soil unploughed by any razor. He was a tawny man, a golden-tawny man, all glowing and radiant with the sun. Another prophet, thought I, come up to town with a message that will save the world.|$|E
6000|$|Ranging {{beyond this}} volume, I cannot {{recollect}} writing {{the first words}} of [...] "The Island Pharisees"--but it would be about August, 1901. Like all the stories in [...] "Villa Rubein," [...] and, indeed, most of my tales, the book originated in the curiosity, philosophic reflections, and unphilosophic emotions roused in me by some single figure in real life. In this case it was Ferrand, whose real name, of course, was not Ferrand, and who died in some [...] "sacred institution" [...] many years ago of a consumption {{brought on by the}} conditions of his wandering life. If not [...] "a beloved," [...] he was a true vagabond, and <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in the Champs Elysees, just as in [...] "The Pigeon" [...] he describes his meeting with Wellwyn. Though drawn very much from life, he did not in the end turn out very like the Ferrand of real life--the figures of fiction soon diverge from their prototypes.|$|E
