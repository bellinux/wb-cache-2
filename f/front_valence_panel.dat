5000|$|When the Porsche 911 Turbo {{debuted in}} August 1974, with large, flared, rear spoilers, they were {{immediately}} dubbed whale tails. Designed to reduce rear-end lift and so keep the car from oversteering at high speeds, the rubber-edges {{of the whale}} tail spoilers {{were thought to be}} [...] "pedestrian friendly". The Turbo, with its whale tail was popular. It also became one of the world's most recognizable sports cars, remaining in production for the next two decades in one form or another, with more than 23,000 sold by 1989, although from 1978, the rear spoiler was redesigned and dubbed 'teatray' on account of its raised sides. The Porsche 911 whale tails were used in conjunction with a chin spoiler attached to the <b>front</b> <b>valence</b> <b>panel,</b> which, according to some sources, did not enhance aerodynamic stability.

2500|$|In 2015, NASCAR's {{regional}} K Pro Series East and West {{along with}} the ARCA Racing Series, the final series to still use the Generation 4 style body, introduced a new body style based off the Gen-6 Sprint Cup cars.

2500|$|Another refresh {{of the car}} in 1993 by Julian Thomson {{resulted}} in the Series 4 (or S4). Exterior changes included a smaller rear spoiler placed halfway up the rear deck-lid and revised front and rear bumpers, side skirts and <b>valence</b> <b>panels.</b> New five-spoke alloy wheels were also fitted. New rectangular taillights were borrowed from the Toyota AE86. The S4's engine produced the same [...] as the SE. The S4 was the first Esprit with power steering.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear wing}} {{remained}} a controversial feature for several years. Its appearance was often criticized,and it {{was accused of}} forcing cars to become airborne in high-speed spins {{such as the one}} experienced by Carl Edwards during the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010 NASCAR decided to replace the wing with the original spoiler. The switch began with the 2010 Goody's Fast Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway.In 2011, NASCAR altered the nose of the car once more, with the splitter being reduced in size and the braces being replaced by a solid <b>front</b> <b>valence.</b>|$|R

Some fauteuils have a <b>valenced</b> <b>front</b> seat rail which is padding that extends slightly over the apron. The exposed wooden elements are often gilded or otherwise painted.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlexithymia is {{characterized}} by a marked inability to identify feelings and emotional states and some studies have documented sensorial perception in response to visual or auditory cues in this disease. Although olfaction is well known for its emotional correlates, the perception of olfactory stimulations has not been previously investigated. This study compares with standard psychophysical methods the olfactory sensitivity and the self-ratings of intensity and hedonic <b>valence</b> of a <b>panel</b> of odorants in alexithymic patients, non-alexithymic patients and control subjects. Results show that alexithymics over-evaluate intensity and pleasantness of odorants compared to non-alexithymics or control subjects. This could be interpreted in the framework of a lack of inhibitory control including this particular sense...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The motion {{complexity}} of modern vehicles may cause several symptoms as nausea, headache, postural discomfort and unsteadiness that are classified within the broad definition of motion sickness (Golding, 2005). Whereas {{the scientific community}} renews efforts to develop some behavioural and pharmaceutical techniques to sup- press motion sickness, this problem is not resolved yet. Interestingly, several authors proposed that unpleasant odors could contribute to motion sickness (Glaser, 1959; Turner and Griffin, 1999; Fessler and Arguello, 2004). However, the relation between olfactory system and motion sickness has not been previously investigated. For this purpose, subjects were recruited among healthy and non-smoker women fulfilling Golding’s (1998) Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ). Subjects were divided in two groups: (1) subjects who {{are very sensitive to}} motion sickness (N= 10), (2) subjects who are not sensitive to motion sickness (N= 10). We compared with usual psychophysics methods the olfactory sensitivity (i. e. threshold testing with the odor of n-butanol), and the self-ratings of intensity, familiarity and hedonic <b>valence</b> of a <b>panel</b> of seventeen odorants. Our results showed: (i) a poor olfactory sensitivity in subjects sensitive to motion sickness (Intergroup T-test, T= 2. 63), (ii) that motion sickness sensitive subjects judged the odor of leather as more unpleasant than the other group (Inter- group T-test, T=- 3. 53), (iii) motion sickness sensitive subjects judged the odor of petrol as more unpleasant (Intergroup T-test, T=- 3. 46) and more familiar than the other group (Intergroup T- test, T= 2. 43). The present results pointed out some differences on olfactory perception relative to motion sickness susceptibility. Herz (2005) high- lighted that the emotional context in which an odor is encountered could influence odor hedonic perception and odor-related behaviour. Thus, we could proposed that subjects who are very sensitive to motion sickness judge odours of leather and petrol as unpleasant because it remind them the bad experience of motion sickness in vehicles, in particular in cars. In this way, we could explain the poor olfactory sensitivity of these subjects as a defence reaction to con- tend to motion sickness. Although several points of our results need to be deeper explore, this study provided support for new techniques to help motion sickness sensitive subjects, based on olfactory perception...|$|R
