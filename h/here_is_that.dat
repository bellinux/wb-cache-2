5|$|The contradiction <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high {{macroeconomic}} {{stability in the}} form of ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems, creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} insight <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> whilst parallel {{arrangements of}} anisotropic objects {{lead to a}} decrease in orientational entropy, there {{is an increase in}} positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> {{from this}} time onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired to an even tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. There seems to {{be little doubt that}} the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, even if his initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E

25|$|Another {{difficulty}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> spin foams {{are defined}} on a discretization of spacetime. While this presents no problems for a topological field theory {{as it has}} no local degrees of freedom, it presents problems for GR.

25|$|It {{is not a}} {{showdown}} at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science.

25|$|The {{estimates}} {{assume that}} a business knows what is required and does not waste time. Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly. A related point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> DB may not understand “work-arounds”, “facilitating fees”, and “learning time” that speed or delay approvals and causes variation costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} of the Pauli principle <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> electrons of the same spin are kept apart by a repulsive exchange interaction, which is a short-range effect, acting simultaneously with the long-range electrostatic or Coulombic force. This effect is {{partly responsible for the}} everyday observation in the macroscopic world that two solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.|$|E

25|$|The {{emerging}} picture <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Abhinavagupta {{lived in}} a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group {{of family and friends}} was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of Tantrāloka.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ground permafrost {{is important to}} the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.|$|E
25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall. The advantage <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the lock can fill faster with the wickets being in the gate, but will not swamp a boat in the lock chamber. In the 1830 design locks, {{the upper and lower}} gates are both the same height. The majority of locks on the C canal are to this specification.|$|E
