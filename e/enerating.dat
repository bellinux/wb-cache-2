40|$|Handheld products, such as {{portable}} digital appliances, {{have been}} widely used in daily life and production activities. For their customers, an ergonomic design is always desired for better user experience and high productivity. Therefore, during the developmentprocess of handheld products, many grasp factors need to be assessed, for instance, grasp stability, grasp comfort, and grasp safety. 3 D human hand modeling and simulation providesignificant advantages for ergonomic assessments when incorporated into the early stage of the design process of handheld products. They can, especially, reduce the need for sensory tests on human subjects and also for expensive prototypes, thus reducing costs and time tomarket. However, current 3 D human hand modelingtechnique that mainly aims to provide visual simulation for game or movie industry (e. g. in famous movie Avatar(2009), CG technique was used to make one lifelike character including hand models) cannot provide aplausible hand model for virtual ergonomic assessment. Therefore the purpose of this research is to model the human hand for virtual ergonomic assessments of handheld products with an acceptable accuracy. First, the main properties of human hand includingsurface skin, joint-link structure, and skin contactdeformation property need to be modeled to generate a fine template hand model. Moreover, based on a fine template hand model owning the main properties mentioned above, hand model instances, with individual hand size or with specific people’s anthropometric statistical characteristics, need to be generated by hand variational modelingmethod. This thesis mainly includes the followingfour topics:(1) Based on MRI measurements of human hand, 3 D precise human hand modeling for product ergonomic assessments was proposed. The surface skin, the joint-linkstructure, and the skin deformation caused by joint motion were modeled and experimentally verified. (2) The skin deformation caused by contact was efficiently simulated for virtual ergonomic assessment of handheld products. The main properties of human hand skin, nonlinear elasticity and compressing-swelling effect, were realized for precise simulation. The results including estimated contact force, contact area,contact pressure distributions in grasping posture were experimentally verified. (3) Variational hand modeling based on image-based 3 D model reconstruction was proposed for modeling a handof a particular person. Experimental verificationindicated that the modeling method could model individual hands including hand surface and joint-link structure in a relatively shorter period and with acceptable accuracy for virtual ergonomic assessments of handheld products. (4) Based on correlation analysis between anthropometricdimensions from subjects, two major dimensions, hand length and circumference, which can be sampled from a Japanese hand database, are used to predict other hand dimensions for <b>enerating</b> hand model instances. By grasping products using these instances in our Digital Hand software, the statistical grasping evaluation indices such as contact area and contact pressure distribution are given...|$|E

Under financial integration, we show how this translates into excessive capital inflows and endogenous cycles.

40|$|Abstract — The {{challenge}} in unstructured p 2 p networks is designing an efficient Search Algorithm. Some typical search algorithms are random walk and flooding. Flooding in general covers many nodes but the drawback is it generates {{huge amount of}} query messages. Random walk g <b>enerates</b> only fewer amounts of query messages but takes long time to search. In this {{paper we propose a}} Proclamation Search (PS) algorithm for avoiding multiple hops in forwarding the query in unstructured Peer to peer network. Proclamation is publishing the synopsis of the contents a peer tends to share and properly distributed and cached by other peers. In this system, the nodes anticipatorily publish their contents, and selectively store interesting contents received from other peers. When there is a search request, a node can find the destination nodes by looking up its local publishing repository, and thus obtain one-hop search with moderate search cost. We analyze the performance of PS algorithm compared to other search algorithms based on search efficiency. Index Terms — Peer-to-peer, proclamation, PS, search, synopsis, Un-structured P 2 P 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile {{consumption}} habits {{have been}} utilized {{as a means}} of generating a hump shaped output response to monetary policy shocks in sticky-price New Keynesian economies, there is relatively little analysis of the impact of habits (particularly, external habit s) on optimal policy. In this paper we consider the implications of external habits for optimal monetary policy, when those habi ts either exist {{at the level of the}} aggregate basket of consumption goods or at the level of individual goods. External habits g <b>enerate</b> an additional distortion in the economy, which implies that the flex-price equilibrium will no longer be efficient and that policy faces interesting new trade-offs and potential stabilization biases. Furthermore, the endogenous mark-up behavior, which emerges when habits are deep, can also significantly affect the optimal policy response to shocks, as well as dramatically affecting the stabilizing properties of standard simple rules. I discuss several lessons regarding the design and conduct of monetary policy that have emerged out of the New Keynesian research program. Those lessons include the benefits of price stability, the gains from commitment about future policies, the importance of natural variables as benchmarks for policy, and the benefits of a credible anti-inflationary stance...|$|R

The disinfectant action of CTAB and SDS on biofilms was assessed by respiratory activity, variation of mass and structure, immediately, 3, 7 and 12 h after the application of the surfactants. Laminar flow-generated biofilms were more susceptible to the action of CTAB than those formed under turbulent flow. Total inactivation of the cells within the biofilms was not achieved for either type of flow- <b>enerated</b> biofilms. For SDS, higher concentrations promoted significant biofilm inactivation, for both turbulent and laminar flow-generated biofilms. CTAB and SDS application did not promote the detachment of biofilms from the surfaces. Post-surfactant treatment, biofilms recovered respiratory activity, in some cases, reaching values higher than those found without chemical treatment. After CTAB treatment, the recovery of respiratory activity was not affected by the hydrodynamic conditions. Conversely, turbulent flow-generated biofilms showed a higher potential to recover their metabolic activity than laminar flow-generated biofilms, when previously challenged with SDS. Concerning biofilm mass, no significant variation (increase or decrease) was detected after 12 h of surfactant treatment. This study shows that care is needed when selecting the correct procedure and agent for biofilm control and demonstrates the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the persistent and recalcitrant properties of P. fluorescens biofilms.

The aim of the present explorative study was to describe psychomotor functioning such as patterns of muscular tension, posture, resistance to passive movements, respiration, and reactions to palpation {{in a group of}} suicide attempters admitted to the Lund Suicide Research Center, Sweden. Fe-three consecutive patients were included in the study (28 women and 25 men; mean age, 42 years; standard deviation, 13; range, 21 - 80 years). The Resource Oriented Body Examination (ROBE) of Buncan was used to assess psychomotor functioning. In addition, some other tests were undertaken, such as laboratory tests (monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma cortisol after dexamethasone) and temperament ratings. Results indicated that the patients generally showed a high level of psychomotor disturbance as compared with reference values. The ROBE total score was significantly higher in patients who later completed suicide than in the non-completer group (P = 0. 02). Two ROBE subgroups were identified. The hypotonic group (n = 19) showed a higher frequency of respiration disturbances (P = 0. 01) than the hypertonic group (n = 34). The hypotonic subgroup also had a significantly higher rate of completed suicides at a follow-up 5 years later (P = 0. 048).

The chemistry of these compounds was dependent upon the pH and the substituents on the quinol imine derivative. The major reaction pathways were hydrolysis of the imine linkage to afford the respective dienone and phenyl migration to afford the amides of 2 -hydroxy- or 2 -methoxy- 5 -aminobiphenyl. The reactivity of the quinol imine derivatives follows the order: 4 -hydroxyl more reactive than 4 -methoxyl compounds and N-acetyl more reactive than N-benzoyl derivatives. The higher reactivity for the former compounds is attributed to the greater electron-donating ability of the 4 -hydroxyl versus the 4 -methoxyl group. The higher reactivity of the N-acetyl relative to the N-benzoyl derivatives is attributed to the ca. 30 -fold increase in basicity of the N-acetyl functionality. The additive effect of the 4 -hydroxyl and N-acetyl functionality on the basic quinol imine moiety makes compounds having both of the groups difficult to isolate in aqueous media. This serves as a limitation for {{the preparation of the}} quinol imine derivative of N-acetyl- 2 -aminofluorene via the anodic oxidation methods reported herein...|$|R
40|$|Disputes {{over the}} {{management}} of water resources in the United States often seem irreconcilable because stakeholders' differences in values, beliefs, and identities are so hard to resolve. Yet, while many efforts to resolve such disputes fail to generate agreement, some do. Looking at these fundamental disagreements about how to manage water, this dissertation attempts to understand why stakeholders in some consensus building processes were able to generate and agree on specific solutions while in other they were not. Two extended disputes about how to manage regional water resources in California and Florida are the focus of this inquiry. In each case, decision-makers convened both collaborative efforts that reached agreement as well as efforts that failed. The findings from this study show that consensus building theory provides some useful explanations for why stakeholders were able to reach agreement in the face of their entrenched value-based differences. The experiences in the two case studies described here show that trading zone theory offers some needed insights that complement consensus building theory's focus on process structure, facilitation, and interest-based problem solving. In the processes that reached agreement in both cases, maps, words, spreadsheets, diagrams, expressions, and calculations were <b>enerated</b> by stakeholders following procedures they agreed were valid to describe the natural, political, cultural, and administrative situation on the ground. Like pieces of a puzzle, these partial representations were then combined and manipulated until stakeholders had constructed a vision of a future situation that they agreed was both desirable and feasible. by Boyd Fuller.

In this study, the inoculum was prepared by cultivated M. purpureus HD 001 in YMP, YES, and MSG medium. Rice was inoculated with 10 % of inoculum and incubated at 30 oC, for 14 days. The growth rate and moisture content of MFR were evaluated in the period from 0 to 14 th day. The dried MFR was extracted with ethanol 95 %, and the ratio of monacolin K/citrinin was estimated by measuring the absorbances of extract at λ 238 (monacolin K) and λ 500 (citrinin). MFR was detoxified by 0. 1 % v/v of H 2 O 2, at room temperature for one hour. Monacolin K and citrinin content in MFR extract was analyzed by HPLC.

After treatment with 0. 1 % H 2 O 2, ratio of monacolin K/citrinin in MFR samples was increased 1. 87 times when compared to before treatment...|$|R

G oal: T o develop, e valuate and validate the EEsAI. Methods: T he development c omprises three p hases: 1. Selection of c andidate items (completed); 2. Evaluation of t he activity index i n a first patient cohort (in progress, p atient recruitment completed); and 3. Validation in a s econd EoE patient cohort. F ocus group interviews with patients {{were used in}} p hase 1 to g <b>enerate</b> patient r eported outcomes (PRO) according to g uidelines o f regulatory authorities (FDA a nd EMA), whereas the section of biologic items was developed by Delphi rounds o f international E oE experts from E urope and North America. Results: T he EEsAI has a modular c omposition to a ssess the following components o f EoE activity: p atient r eported outcomes, e ndoscopic activity, histologic activity, laboratory activity, a nd quality of l ife (QoL).

40|$|The {{popularity}} and explosive growth of numerical analysis today are {{further evidence that}} applications are still the leading source of inspiration for mathematical creativity. 	Whenever new mathematical ideas are developed it is usually new applications which have pointed the way. The electronic computing machine is itself an illustration of this, are sponce to an overwhelming need for faster computation. {{and the appearance of}} such machines has made it possible {{to meet the demands of}} today s applications, in many cases, by developing more numerical methods. This is the pedigree of modern numerical analysis. It is the numerical aspect of the board field of applied analysis. It would be a mistake, however, to draw too fine a boundary between our subject and what is called pure or abstract analysis. The borderline is a fuzzy one, as borderlines usually are, and materials from both sides frequently infiltrate the other. In earlier days it was commonplace for mathematicians to be expert at both the pure and the applied. Both have long since developed to a size which makes full acquaintance with even one impossible. and reasonable competence at both an arduous objective. In spite of this the applied mathematician, icluding the numerical analyst, must try to keep a ware of what is happening across the border. The proof of the classical existence theorem, of differential equations by "applied" methods is a beautiful illustration of how applications lead eventually to abstract theory. So, our principal interest is numerical mathematics, because they are a remainder of the fuzzy borderline and of the value of infiltration in both directions. The numerical analyst is after all, an analyst. The behavior of many physical processes, particularly those in systems undergoing time- dependent change (transients), can be described by ordinary differential equations are of great importance to engineers and scientists. Although many important differential equations can be solved by weel-know analytical techniques, a great number of physically significant differential equations can not be solved. Fortunately, the solutions of these equations can usually be <b>enerated</b> numerically. This project will describe the importance of these numerical methods. M...|$|R
