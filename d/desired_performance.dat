5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>{{performance}},</b> Lockheed chose a minimalist approach: a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest, most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine. The emphasis was on minimizing drag and mass.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} <b>desired</b> <b>performance,</b> several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{management}} literature, {{gap analysis}} involves {{the comparison of}} actual performance with potential or <b>desired</b> <b>performance.</b> If an organization {{does not make the}} best use of current resources, or forgoes investment in capital or technology, it may produce or perform below its potential. This concept is similar to an economy's production being below the production possibilities frontier.|$|E

25|$|By {{this time}} the team had {{become aware of the}} UK's Gee efforts, and were aware that Gee used a system of {{electronically}} generated strobes that produced pips on the display that were accurately aligned with system timing. They sent a team to the UK to learn about the strobe concept, and immediately adopted it for their work. But as part of this exchange, the Project 3 team found that Gee was almost identical to their own system in concept and <b>desired</b> <b>performance.</b> Unlike their system, Gee had largely completed development and was proceeding to production. The decision was made to abandon the current efforts, use Gee on their own aircraft, and re-develop their system for the long-range role instead.|$|E
25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually {{walk through a}} scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his <b>desired</b> <b>performance.</b> On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing {{his hand on the}} railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E
500|$|On 23 November 1945, Air Materiel Command (AMC) issued <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> {{characteristics}} {{for a new}} {{strategic bomber}} [...] "capable of carrying out the strategic mission without dependence upon advanced and intermediate bases controlled by other countries". The aircraft {{was to have a}} crew of five or more turret gunners, and a six-man relief crew. It was required to cruise at 300mph (260knots, 480km/h) at 34,000feet (10,400m) with a combat radius of 5,000miles (4,300nautical miles, 8,000km). The armament was to consist of an unspecified number of 20mm cannon and 10,000pounds (4,500kg) of bombs. On 13 February 1946, the Air Force issued bid invitations for these specifications, with Boeing, Consolidated Aircraft, and Glenn L. Martin Company submitting proposals.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{micromanipulation}} and microassembly tasks, the manipulated micro-objects do {{not always}} have the same characteristics, such as compliance. Thus, both the static and dynamic models representing the force behavior respect to input sollicitations depend {{on the characteristics of}} of the manipulated micro-object. As a result, it is hard to synthesize a single controller able to ensure <b>desired</b> <b>performances</b> for all set of micro-objects, especially when their compliance range is very large. In this paper, we propose to model and control the manipulation force applied by piezoelectric microactuators by using a parameter dependent approach such that <b>desired</b> <b>performances</b> are ensured for all kind of manipulated objects. The resulting controller is said self-scheduled and easy to implement from numerical point of view. First, we derive a model that is dependent on the characteristics of the manipulated micro-object. The strong hysteresis nonlinearity of the piezoelectric microactuator was compensated and the derived model is therefore linear. Afterwards, we design a self-scheduled controller using H technique. In order to ensure the <b>desired</b> <b>performances</b> (micrometric accuracy, tens of millisecon∞d of settling time) for any manipulated micro-objects, a parameter dependent controller is designed respect to the continuum of models. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed design procedure will be illustrated from experimental results...|$|R

500|$|Glide waxes {{enhance the}} speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then {{polishing}} the ski bottom. [...] Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> with higher performance coming at higher cost. [...] Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on paraffin are common for recreational use. [...] Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays. [...] Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.|$|E

40|$|Cable driven {{systems have}} been applied in several {{manipulators}} and due to their high backdrivability and apparent low inertia have been successfully used in telemanipulation systems. However, {{in order to achieve}} high performances, a control to keep the cables taut is needed. In this paper, a position control in the null and range space is used to avoid cables from slacking and to achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>performances.</b> Indeed, a cable driven manipulator is a redundant system and its null space represents the internal forces, that is the tensions of the cables. To guarantee robustness against model parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, a position based disturbance observer has been designed. Proof of stability of the proposed control and bounds of the estimation error have been given. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>performances</b> keeping the cables taut...|$|R
2500|$|Cabinets {{need to be}} {{maintained}} on a regular schedule. During this certification check, the airflow and the filter capacities are verified. The filters have a limited lifespan - determined by the air quality within the laboratory space {{and the amount of}} particles and aerosols generated inside the BSC' work zone. As these filters load, the internal fan is required to do more work to push/pull the same volume of air through them. Newer cabinets measure the air flow constantly and self compensate fan performance to ensure constant volumes of air moving through the filters and the cabinet. If the flow drops below <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> an audio and visual alarm will alert the operator. Changing the filter should be limited to trained persons as the filter is potentially contaminated. This can be done either after the cabinet has been decontaminated using a gaseous procedure (using Formaldehyde, Chlorine Dioxide or Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) or a [...] "bag-in/bag-out" [...] procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{the only}} US Navy ships {{that can produce}} enough {{electrical}} power to get <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> are the Zumwalt-class destroyers; they can generate 78 megawatts of power, more than is necessary to power a railgun. [...] Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. Most current destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range [...] (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles {{at a rate of}} 10 shots per minute). Even if current ships, such as the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, can be upgraded with enough electrical power to operate a railgun, the space taken up on the ships by the integration of an additional weapon system may force the removal of existing weapon systems to make room available. The first shipboard tests was to be from a railgun installed on an Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport (EFT), but this was later changed to land based testing.|$|E
2500|$|The Fanno flow {{model is}} often used {{in the design and}} {{analysis}} of nozzles. [...] In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with isentropic flow, while the constant area section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow. [...] For given upstream conditions at point 1 as shown in Figures 3 and 4, calculations can be made to determine the nozzle exit Mach number and the location of a normal shock in the constant area duct. [...] Point 2 labels the nozzle throat, where M= 1 if the flow is choked. [...] Point 3 labels the end of the nozzle where the flow transitions from isentropic to Fanno. [...] With a high enough initial pressure, supersonic flow can be maintained through the constant area duct, similar to the <b>desired</b> <b>performance</b> of a blowdown-type supersonic wind tunnel. [...] However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct. [...] If a shock wave is present, the flow transitions from the supersonic portion of the Fanno line to the subsonic portion before continuing towards M= 1. [...] The movement in Figure 4 is always from the left to the right in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
