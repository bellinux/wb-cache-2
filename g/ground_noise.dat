[...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, {{a process known as}} [...] "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} feed antenna has to be tailored {{to the shape of}} the dish, because it has a strong influence on the aperture efficiency, which determines the antenna gain (see Gain section below). [...] Radiation from the feed that falls outside the edge of the dish is called [...] "spillover" [...] and is wasted, reducing the gain and increasing the backlobes, possibly causing interference or (in receiving antennas) increasing susceptibility to <b>ground</b> <b>noise.</b> [...] However, maximum gain is only achieved when the dish is uniformly [...] "illuminated" [...] with a constant field strength to its edges. [...] So the ideal {{radiation pattern}} of a feed antenna would be a constant field strength throughout the solid angle of the dish, dropping abruptly to zero at the edges. [...] However, practical feed antennas have radiation patterns that drop off gradually at the edges, so the feed antenna is a compromise between acceptably low spillover and adequate illumination. [...] For most front feed horns, optimum illumination is achieved when the power radiated by the feed horn is 10 dB less at the dish edge than its maximum value {{at the center of the}} dish.|$|E

5000|$|In {{electronic}}s, <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> is electronic noise on {{the ground}} wires or busses of an electronic circuit. In audio, radio, and digital equipment it represents an undesirable condition since the noise {{can get into the}} signal path of the device, appearing as interference in the output.

50|$|A more {{comprehensive}} {{solution is to}} use equipment that employs balanced signal lines. <b>Ground</b> <b>noise</b> can only get into the signal path in an unbalanced line, in which the ground or shield conductor serves as {{one side of the}} signal path. In a balanced cable, the signal is sent as a differential signal along a pair of wires, neither of which are connected to ground. Any noise from the ground system induced in the signal lines is a common-mode signal, identical in both wires. Since the line receiver at the destination end only responds to differential signals, a difference in voltage between the two lines, the common-mode noise is cancelled out. Thus these systems are very immune to electrical noise, including <b>ground</b> <b>noise.</b> Professional and scientific equipment often uses balanced cabling.|$|E
