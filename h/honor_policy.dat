In the result of those inquiries, although the committees consisted of very different descriptions, they were unanimous.

Hence I explore, first, the controversial questions surrounding <b>honors</b> admissions <b>policies.</b> In addition, I look at the discrepancies that exist between the privileges afforded to honors students versus non-honors students. I believe these two issues challenge all honors administrators to remain vigilant {{in regard to the}} idea of honor and the oftentimes questionable barriers set in place that confer honors privileges. My graduate assistantship in the Provost’s Office at The University of Vermont has provided me with an administrative angle on honors which has pressed me to construct my own unique view of what honors is and can be.

After a unionist rally in May 2012, the Gagauz mayor of Comrat, Nicolai Dudoglo, threatened that his city would only hoist the Gagauz symbols, and remove Moldovan flags. In 2014, {{in the context of}} the Ukrainian crisis and pro-Russian unrest on Moldova's borders, there was some concern about similar events unfolding in Moldova. During that interval, a group of pro-Russian Gagauz in Comrat flew the flag of Russia.

50|$|Another {{real-world}} {{application of}} the insufficient punishment theory involves a study done on <b>honor</b> code <b>policies</b> at military versus regular universities. The study was called Dissonance and the Honor System: Extending the Severity of Threat Phenomenon. The study discussed the consideration of ethical responsibility and academic dishonesty in collegiate settings as something of great concern. Recent estimates suggest that up to 70% of college students cheat at some point prior to graduation. When put under the honor system, {{students are expected to}} uphold their personal sense of moral responsibilities. As discussed earlier, the threat of severe punishment restrains behavior on the basis of avoiding punishment, and therefore {{people are more likely to}} engage in the prohibited behavior when consequences are lowered. Inversely, when punishment is low and cognitive dissonance is high, people must internally justify their reasons for not engaging in a prohibited behavior. In context with this study, students that are used to being threatened with severe punishment for academic dishonesty are more likely to be dishonest when the immediate threat of punishment is not present; whereas students that do not face the pressure of punishment act consistently with and without the threat of immediate punishment.|$|R

Lloyd's of London responded with a counter-suit seeking damages against Braxton and remarked that Braxton's policy was null and void because of an unrelated heart condition {{that the company was}} not made aware of at the time the application was filed. Braxton responded to the counter-suit by saying that she did disclose her full medical history at the time. As a result of the insurance company nullifying Braxton's contract, Braxton has said that she was on the hook for all damages because of the cancelled shows, being sued by multiple companies, and had to once again file for bankruptcy, as announced on October 7, 2010. As of 2013, Braxton has completed required financial management courses and most of her debt has been discharged.|$|R

In this paper, I examine the causes and ramifications of the BP spill in the context of oil regulation and industry safety culture. I argue that the spill resulted from a deficient safety culture, poor regulatory oversight, and negligible prioritization of the environmental and safety protocol. To correct the incentive schemes and safety culture of the oil industry, I propose a model that utilizes consumer pressure to incentivize companies to maximize environmentally responsible production. Ultimately, disclosing the environmentally records of oil companies can capture environmentally minded consumers and align {{the best interests of the}} industry with environmental stewardship. 2011 Public <b>Policy</b> <b>Honors</b> Thesi...|$|R

The SSDNC also earned many prizes from the provincial government; even Prime Minister Wen Jiabao gave his approval after hearing the Nanguo City mayor’s report. In July 2007, the Vice Deputy of Nanguo municipal government was invited to share its health insurance policy innovation experience to the national representatives at the national conference of urban–rural resident health insurance development, bringing even more fame to the leaders of Nanguo City. Due to policy entrepreneurs’ sustained efforts, the SSDNC brought many highlights to local leaders’ list of political achievements.|$|R

Bakker and Schrijvers (2000) and the Saxton Report (2002) have {{presented}} estimates of the subsidy element in IMF lending. In this article, we present an improved and updated calculation. We also present evidence on another criticism of IMF policy: that it fails to enforce compliance with policy conditions. The IMF claims that it cancels its programs if debtor governments do not <b>honor</b> their <b>policy</b> commitments. We show that cancellations due to noncompliance tend to be followed by new programs very soon. Measuring the Subsidy in IMF Credits Bakker and Schrijvers (2000) tried to quantify the subsidies implicit in the IMF credits that the seven main borrowers received during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 – 99. They compared the IMFs adjusted rate of charge with the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) published by J. P. Morgan.

5000|$|In 1949 {{students}} {{drafted the}} first Honor Code enforced by an Honor Council {{of students and}} administrators, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. The Student Honor Council, created around 1949, oversaw case violations. This council met with enough success among students in alleviating cheating that in 1957 BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson suggested the Honor Code expand to include other school standards. This led to an expansion during the 1960s which created the bulk of what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. Instead of a short paragraph on university standards, the undergraduate catalog began printing a more detailed set of <b>Honor</b> Code <b>policies</b> in 1968, including a clause requiring students to act when observing any violation {{and a list of}} banned drugs ("amphetamines, barbiturates, hallucinogenic drugs, psychedelic drugs, and narcotics"). This change came because the administration completely took over the previously student run honor code and disbanded the student senate and student honor code committee. The honor code was expanded in the 1970 catalog with a requirement to adhere to the [...] "standards of dress" [...] and the addition of marijuana and LSD to the list of banned drugs.|$|R

40|$|Childhood obesity {{rates in}} the United States have been {{increasing}} at alarming rates. Schools must play an integral role in obesity prevention efforts to reverse current trends. In order to understand how schools can improve wellness policies, {{it is important to}} determine what obstacles they face in implementing such policies and programs. Interviews with stakeholders at the district- and school-levels indicate four main barriers to the implementation of wellness policies: finances, institutional support, participation, and involvement and education at home. The study further concludes that physical activity policies are weaker than nutrition policies. Schools are also found to have greater discretion over physical activity polices than nutrition polices. The key recommendation of the study is that schools strengthen physical activity policies and programs in order to improve obesity prevention efforts. Public <b>Policy</b> <b>Honors</b> Thesi...|$|R

40|$|Illness {{significantly}} reduces worker productivity, yet how employers {{respond to}} the possibility of illness and its effects on work performance is not well understood. The 2003 American Productivity Audit pegged the cost to employers of lost productive time due to illness at 225. 8 billion US dollars/year. More importantly, 71 % of that loss was explained by reduced performance while at work. Studies of worker illness have been up to this point empirical, focused primarily on characteristics which co-vary with worker illness and absenteeism. This paper seeks to understand how employers mitigate the impact of illness on profits through a microeconomic model, elucidating how employers influence workers through salary-based incentives to mitigate its associated costs, providing firms and policy makers with a comprehensive theoretical method for formulating optimal sick pay <b>policies.</b> <b>Honors</b> thesis, Department of Mathematic...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the Supreme Court and newsprint media interface with and react to each other’s arguments, justification, and framing {{of the death}} penalty. As the philosophical justification behind the use of capital punishment evolves, how can we describe {{the similarities and differences}} between how the Supreme Court frames issues of capital punishment and how the press portrays the same? Using a case-study analysis, this paper identifies three sets of chronologically- related and issue-related death penalty cases (from 1971 to 2005) and compares the presence and importance of the varying Supreme Court arguments and newspaper frames. I find that, while the Supreme Court appears to set the boundaries of the death penalty debate for newsprint media, the latter may actually set the agenda of the Court when it strategically 1.) makes comparisons to foreign legal practices or 2.) alleges that caprice and bias pervade through the American capital punishment mechanism.

The limitations of notable texts are presented, arguing they fail to recognize structured pressures that constrain those interpellated within Orientalist apparatuses, and states the suggestively depoliticized presence of Christian missionaries parallels secular Western governmental interventions, implicitly delegitimizing the African State. By considering the influence of representations of Africa by dominant media, university, and state ideological apparatuses the thesis illustrates how the repetition and replication of imagined narratives about the continent create an American culture of differential empathy, framing all Africans as inherently destitute and needy, and poor Americans as lazy.
