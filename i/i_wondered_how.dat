500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{says that}} the play {{was the first one}} he ever read and predated his {{interest}} in becoming an [...] actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show's director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that [...] "My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Love {{submitted}} the final lyrics for [...] "Good Vibrations", {{claiming to have}} written them on the drive to the studio. Love reacted upon hearing the unfinished backing track: [...] " [...] was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> our fans were going to relate to it. How's this {{going to go over}} in the Midwest or Birmingham? It was such a departure from 'Surfin' U.S.A.' or 'Help Me, Rhonda.'" [...] Feeling that the song could be [...] "the Beach Boys' psychedelic anthem or flower power offering", he based the lyrics on the burgeoning psychedelic music and Flower Power movements occurring in San Francisco and some parts of the Los Angeles area. He described the lyrics as [...] "just a flowery poem. Kind of almost like 'If you’re going to San Francisco be sure to wear flowers in your hair.'" [...] Writer Bruce Golden observed: ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{fellow student}} of Schotz' at Glasgow {{at this time}} was Margaret Priest, who later emigrated to Perth in Western Australia, where she became an {{important}} local sculptor. She {{was impressed by the}} cosmopolitan atmosphere and wider experience of the world brought to the Glasgow School by King and the other refugee students. She later recollected that: “There were assorted part-time students who came and went around the School of Art ... was always free with advice and help and tools and materials so that they became absorbed in our group. We were an astonishing mixture of cultures and it did us the world of good. ... They all offered the same unstinting friendship and hospitality spiced with that wonderful Jewish humour. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> they could all be so clever.” ...|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
2500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{acted as}} {{assistant}} director and stage {{manager for a}} successful 1965 production of the play Off-Broadway at the Sheridan Square Playhouse in New York City. The play's director, Ulu Grosbard, suggested to Arthur Miller that Hoffman would one day make a great Willy Loman (a role that Hoffman would later play to great acclaim). Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that [...] "My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate {{for any kind of}} acting career." [...] Another production in New York opened on February 3, 1983, at the Ambassador Theatre, with Tony Lo Bianco as Eddie and directed by Arvin Brown. It ran for 149 performances. An award-winning production in New York opened on December 14, 1997, at the Criterion Center Stage Right and subsequently transferred to the Neil Simon Theatre. It ran for 239 performances. It was directed by Michael Mayer and the cast included Anthony LaPaglia, Allison Janney, and a young Brittany Murphy. The production won the Tony Award for: Best Revival of a Play; Best Leading Actor in a Play (LaPaglia); it also won Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Revival, Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play (Janney), and Outstanding Direction of a Play. A revival at the Cort Theatre on Broadway in 2009 starred Liev Schreiber, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Hecht.

2500|$|In 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and {{the rest}} of Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi {{convinced}} he would be executed when he arrived. At the border, there were two lines of soldiers, one Soviet and the other Chinese, and as Puyi walked past, he remembered how the faces of the other prisoners were [...] "deathly pale". Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this {{was the beginning of a}} new life for him. In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life used ni (你), the informal word for you instead of nin (您), the formal word for you to address people. When the train stopped at Changchun to pick up food, Puyi was convinced that was he was going to be shot at his former capital, and he was much relieved when the train resumed its journey to Fushun. Except for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning province until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers. Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the other prisoners, who liked to humiliate an emperor, and he might not have survived his imprisonment except for the fact that the warden Jin Yuan went out of his way to protect him. Jin had grown up under Manchukuo and as a schoolboy in the 1930s had kowtowed to portraits of Puyi and waved the Manchukuo flag in the streets when Puyi made visits to Harbin. As Jin had grown up in Manchukuo, he was fluent in Japanese, which was why he was selected to be the warden of Fushun. Jin was assigned the job in 1950 and told Behr in a 1986 interview that: [...] "I didn't welcome the idea at all. I tried to get another posting. I wanted nothing to do with those who had been responsible for my older brother's death and my family's suffering during the Manchukuo years. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> I could ever bear to be in their company". However, Jin further told Behr that he [...] "came to like Puyi quite a bit" [...] as he got to know him, and protected him from the other prisoners. In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.|$|E
