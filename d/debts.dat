In this context she claimed that Blount, {{in the process of}} paying off Leicester's <b>debts,</b> had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth.

Some <b>debts</b> that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. <b>Debts</b> to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
