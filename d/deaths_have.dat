5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been reported since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand {{as the nation}} is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; this unique status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E
5|$|Among evangelical Christians, {{the five}} men are {{commonly}} considered martyrs and missionary heroes. Books {{have been written}} about them by numerous biographers, most notably Elisabeth Elliot. Anniversaries of their <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been accompanied by stories in major Christian publications, and their story, as well as the subsequent acceptance of Christianity among the Huaorani, has been turned into several motion pictures.|$|E

6000|$|... +Stanza 41,+ 1. 1. He lives, he wakes--'tis Death is dead, not he. In the {{preceding}} three stanzas Adonais is contemplated as being alive, {{owing to the}} very fact that his <b>death</b> <b>has</b> awakened him 'from the dream of life'--mundane life. <b>Death</b> <b>has</b> bestowed upon him a vitality superior to that of mundane life. <b>Death</b> therefore <b>has</b> performed an act contrary to his own essence as <b>death,</b> and <b>has</b> practically killed, not Adonais, but himself.|$|R
50|$|<b>Death</b> <b>has</b> been personified as {{a figure}} or fictional {{character}} in mythology and popular culture since {{the earliest days of}} storytelling. Because the reality of <b>death</b> <b>has</b> had a substantial influence on the human psyche and the development of civilization as a whole, the personification of Death as a living, sentient entity is a concept that has existed in many societies since before the beginning of recorded history. In western culture, <b>death</b> <b>has</b> long been shown as a skeletal figure carrying a large scythe, and sometimes wearing a midnight black gown with a hood. This image was widely illustrated during the Middle Ages.|$|R
5|$|In {{almost all}} cases, {{symptoms}} resolve within a week. Fatalities are extremely unlikely. No <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been reported since {{the introduction of}} antivenom in 1956. Before this, redback spider bites had been implicated in at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be definitively linked to the Redback bite as the sole cause.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been recorded. People prone to severe allergic reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{the adult}} cane toad is toxic, {{as well as the}} {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals; even human <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been recorded due to the consumption of cane toads.|$|E

5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Health effects {{extended}} to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> {{been linked to}} the toxic dust, and the victims' names were included in the World Trade Center memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. <b>Deaths</b> <b>have</b> declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E

5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of Cameron and Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, originally thought to be at risk, escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the indirect deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
