50|$|There are {{typically}} two parts to the process; first, {{the exchange of}} unused stamps for new ones of equivalent value. This normally occurs at post offices, with patrons bringing in their old stamps. The second part is the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> with stamps already on it. Uncancelled letters, such as those dropped in mailbox, will get a grace period, ending {{at roughly the same}} time as the exchange of old stamps. Cancelled letters already in the mailstream may be accepted for a longer period, since remote post offices may not yet have exchanged their stamps, and sometimes there may be delays within the postal system itself.|$|E

5000|$|After {{standing}} apparently unused {{for more}} than 30 years, in 1913 the Dresdner Bahnhof was incorporated into a much larger facility - the Postbahnhof, dedicated to the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> By then there were even more rails {{in the immediate vicinity}} following the arrival of the U-Bahn. Its original route, opened in stages during 1902, comprised a through section from Warschauer Brücke to Knie, with a triangular junction between Möckernbrücke and Bülowstraße giving access to Potsdamer Platz. This triangle of lines gave its name to the area (Gleisdreieck, literally meaning [...] "railway triangle"), and also to the station constructed there. Following an accident on 26 September 1908, in which two trains collided on the triangle, killing 18 people and injuring 21 others, the layout was reorganised in 1912 into what can be seen today, with two lines crossing one over the other at right angles, and a split-level station with platforms on both lines. The Dresdner Bahnhof, and the Postbahnhof of which it became part, lay in the south-east quadrant, right in the angle between the two lines. In this guise it lasted for eight more decades, finally closing in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Also {{continued}} in the Series of 1902 {{was the use of}} the Universal Postal Union colors required of all member nations on stamps for post cards (green, 1¢), regular mail (red, 2¢) and international mail (blue, 5¢). These were meant to facilitate the easy <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> international <b>mail</b> and had been adopted for {{the final version of the}} First Bureau Issue in 1898. Of the eleven remaining 1902 denominations, ten appeared in colors identical--or nearly identical--to those of their 1898 counterparts: only the 8¢ stamp was significantly different in hue.|$|R

40|$|The current {{mail server}} {{architecture}} spawns a new process upon every new connection it receives.

We propose a new architecture for mail servers, that retains the advantages of the process architecture for receiving mails, {{but at the same time}} wastes little server resources in case of bounced emails/rogue connections. Essentially, the new architecture does not fork off a new process until it is certain that the mail will not get bounced.

40|$|After public {{notification}} of confirmed cases of bioterrorism-related anthrax, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emergency Operations Center responded to 11, 063 bioterrorism-related telephone calls from October 8 to November 11, 2001. Most calls were inquiries {{from the public}} about anthrax vaccines (58. 4 %), requests for general information on bioterrorism prevention (14. 8 %), and use of personal protective equipment (12. 0 %); 882 telephone calls (8. 0 %) were referred to the state liaison team for follow-up investigation. Of these, 226 (25. 6 %) included reports of either illness clinically confirmed to be compatible with anthrax or direct exposure to an environment known to be contaminated with Bacillus anthracis.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the practices of}} the records management system {{in the public schools}} in the Division of Mandaue City on the school year 2012 - 2013 towards the adoption of an Enhanced School Records Management System. The study further considered the profile of the respondent groups as vital variables which significantly affected the performance of the school records officers or custodians. Specifically, this study was conceived to look into the level of implementation of the different components of the Records Management System as perceived by the respondents namely; the functions of School Records Office, the Duties and Responsibilities of the Records Officers and the Records Management Operating Procedures which includes the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> and communications, <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> legal documents and administrative issuances, classification guide for filing school management documents, procedure for filing, servicing with files, request for personal information, access to files, records disposal procedure, preservation of records and the retention period or life cycle of records and documents. The responses were identified and analyzed using the weighted mean formula of which the results were collated and tabulated. Finally, this study aimed to determine the mean difference among the respondent groups’ perceptions on the aforementioned prescribed aspects of the School Records Management which was statistically treated through the t-test model. The tally described the results of the respondents’ perceptions on the two aspects, the functions of the records office and the duties and responsibilities of records officers, as not significantly related to each other. Both respondents were almost attuned in their perceptions on the abovesaid two aspects. However, a different picture had been seen on the third aspect, operating procedures of Records Management, which established a significant mean difference among the perceptions of the respondent groups.

50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} limits {{on the number of}} routes a single sorter could service was the length of their arms. This limited the stack of pigeon holes to a cabinet three to four feet on a side. Making the pigeon holes smaller allowed any one sorter to have more of them within reach, but increased the effort needed to place the letter in the bin, as well as reducing the number of letters that could be sent to a given destination before the pigeon hole filled up. Most stations had about two dozen pigeon holes, which demanded huge numbers <b>of</b> sorters to <b>handle</b> large volumes <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> and routes.|$|R
2500|$|By the 1880s, {{railway post}} office routes were {{operating}} on {{the vast majority of}} passenger trains in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. Railway mail clerks were subjected to stringent training and ongoing testing of details regarding their <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mail.</b> [...] On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring only 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service division superintendent. Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs. The Boston Elevated Railway car being noted as making circuits of the city to pick up mail.|$|R
