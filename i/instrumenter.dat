40|$|The Dyninst binary {{instrumentation}} {{and analysis}} framework distinguishes itself from other binary instrumentation tools through its abstract, machine independent interface; its em-phasis on anywhere, any-time binary instrumentation; and its low overhead that {{is proportional to}} the number of in-strumented locations. Dyninst represents the program in terms of familiar control flow structures such as functions, loops, and basic blocks, and users manipulate these repre-sentations to insert instrumentation anywhere in the binary. We use graph transformation techniques to insure that this instrumentation executes when desired even when instru-menting highly optimized (or malicious) code that other in-strumenters cannot correctly instrument. Unlike other bi-nary <b>instrumenters,</b> Dyninst can instrument {{at any time in the}} execution continuum, from static instrumentation (bi-nary rewriting) to instrumenting actively executing code (dynamic instrumentation). Furthermore, we allow users to modify or remove instrumentation at any time, with such modifications taking immediate effect. Our analysis tech-niques allow us to insert new code without modifying unin-strumented code; as a result, all uninstrumented code exe-cutes at native speed. We demonstrate that our techniques provide this collection of capabilities while imposing similar or lower overhead than other widely used <b>instrumenters...</b>|$|R

50|$|Daniel P. Stråhle {{was active}} as an organ builder in central Sweden {{in the second}} quarter of the eighteenth century. He had worked as a {{journeyman}} for the important Stockholm organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman, and in 1741, four years after Cahman's death, Stråhle was granted his privilege for organ making. According to the system in force in Sweden at the time a privilege, a granted monopoly which was held by only a few of the most established makers of each type of musical instruments, gave him the legal right to build and repair organs, as well as to train and examine workers, and it also served as a guarantee of the quality of the work and education of the maker. An organ by him from 1743 is preserved in its original condition at the chapel at Strömsholm Palace; he is also known to have made clavichords, and a notable example with an unusual string scale and construction signed by him and dated 1738 is owned by the Stockholm Music Museum. His apprentices included his nephew Petter Stråhle and Jonas Gren, partners in the famous Stockholm organ builders Gren & Stråhle, and according to Abraham Abrahamsson Hülphers in his book Historisk Afhandling om Musik och <b>Instrumenter</b> published in 1773, Stråhle himself had studied mechanics (which has been assumed to have included mathematics) with Swedish Academy of Science founding member Christopher Polhem.

Materialet utgjordes av 16 patienter insamlade på Tandvårdshögskolans jourmottagning. Patienter med svullnad och allmänpåverkan exkluderades. Patienterna valdes slumpmässigt ut till att genomgå någon av behandlingarna. Den preoperativa smärtnivån och ev. analgetikaintag registrerades. Tre till fem dagar efter utförd behandling kontaktades patienterna per telefon och fick då gradera sin postoperativa smärtnivå samt analgetika- och/eller antibiotikaintag. Resultatet visade att 100 % av patienterna som behandlades med fullständig utrensning erhöll tillfredställande smärtlindring jämfört med 71 % av de patienter som behandlades med enbart utrymning av pulpakavum. Skillnaden var inte statistiskt signifikant. 44 % av patienterna som behandlades med fullständig utrensning hade tagit smärtstillande postoperativt medan 29 % av patienterna i utrymningsgruppen hade gjort det. Skillnaden var inte signifikant. Ingen av patienterna oavsett behandling hade tagit antibiotika efter behandlingen. Ingen skillnad förelåg i andelen patienter som blev tillräckligt smärtlindrade mellan fullständig utrensning och enbart utrymning av pulpakavum hos tänder med symtomatisk apikal parodontit.

The material consisted of 16 patients collected at the emergency clinic at Malmö University. Patients with swelling and/or systemic involvement were excluded. The patients were randomized to either treatment. The preoperative pain level and intake of analgesics was registered. Three till 5 days postoperatively the patients were contacted and asked to grade the current pain level and intake of analgesics and/or antibiotics. The results showed that 100 % of the patients treated with complete chemo mechanical disinfection of the root canal system obtained satisfying pain relief compared to 71 % for patients treated with removal of necrotic tissue in the pulp chamber. 44 % of the patients treated with chemo mechanical disinfection of the root canal system {{had some kind of}} analgesics postoperatively compared to 29 % for those treated with removal of necrotic tissue in the pulp chamber. No patients in either group reported use of antibiotics postoperatively.

40|$|Abstract. With version 3. 0, the OpenMP {{specification}} {{introduced a}} task construct {{and with it}} an additional dimension of concurrency. While offering a convenient means to express task parallelism, the new construct presents a serious challenge to event-based performance analysis. Since tasking may disrupt the classic sequence of region entry and exit events, essential analysis procedures such as reconstructing dynamic call paths or correctly attributing performance metrics to individual task region instances may become impossible. To overcome this limitation, we describe a portable method to distinguish individual task instances and to track their suspension and resumption with event-based instrumentation. Implemented {{as an extension of}} the OPARI source-code <b>instrumenter,</b> our portable solution supports C/C++ programs with tied tasks and with untied tasks that are suspended only at implied scheduling points, while introducing only negligible measurement overhead. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the OpenMP specification to provide general support for task identifiers with untied tasks. ...|$|E

Usage: An instrumented application is linked with the ompP profiling library. Upon termination, a text-based profiling report is written to a file. Hardware counters are supported using the PAPI library, particular HWC events are selected via environment variable settings. Profiling Report: The main contents of the ompP profiling report are: • A header containing general information such as date and time of the program run. • A list of all identified Opari regions (corresponding to OpenMP constructs) with their type (PARALLEL, ATOMIC, BARRIER, [...] .) and source file and line number information. • A region summary list where performance data is summarized over all threads. This list is sorted according to summed execution time and is intended to enable the developer to quickly identify the most time-consuming regions (and thus the most promising optimization targets). • A detailed region summary for each identified region and for a specific region stack. This information allows the identification of load imbalances in the execution time and many other causes of inefficient or incorrect behavior. • A region summary for each region, where data is summed over all different region stacks that lead to the particular region (i. e., the flat profile for the region).

Selleks, et mõõta mälueraldamiste jälgijate effektivsus kasutasime SPECjvm 2008 jõudlustestide komplekt. Mälu kasutamise mõõtmiseks oli kirjatud oma JVM TI agent, mis perioodiliselt kirjutab kasutatud mälu suurus CSV faili. Töö käigus olid läbi vaadatud ja testitud selliseid mälueraldamiste jälgimise lahendusi: •	HRPOF – lihtne käsurea kasutajaliidesega profileerimise tööriist, mis pakutakse JavaDevelopment Kit (JDK) koosseisus. •	NetBeans profileerija – varem see oli eraldiseisav avatud lähtekoodiga uurimis proekt nimega JFluid. Praegu see on NetBeansi osa. •	TPTP profileerija – profileerija, mis kasutatakse Eclipse IDE’s. •	Project Allocation <b>Instrumenter</b> – mälu eraldamiste jälgija Google’st. On kirjutatud puhtas Javas. Kasutab java. lang. instrument API ja ASM raamistikku baitkoodi analüüsimiseks ja manipuleerimiseks. Neljast kahel mäluereldamiste jälgijatel olid probleemid stabiilsusega. NetBeans valesti muutus javazoom. jl. decoder. huffcodetab klassi baitkoodi, mille pärast ei saanud mpegaudio testi käivitada. Eclipse TPTP profileerija ei suutnud edukalt oma tööd lõpetada mitmel korral erinevate jõudlustestide käivitamise ajal. NetBeans profileerija on tehniliselt kõige arenenum ja kõike tõhusam mäluerdlamiste jälgimise lahendus. See ei ole üllatav, kuna Sun’i insenerid kirjutasid seda parrallelselt Java virtualse masina arenguga. Kõige problemaatilisem mälueraldamiste jälgimise mõttes oli sunflow jõudlustest. Koos TPTP profileerijaga ta jooksis umbes 300 korda aeglasemalt. HPROF’i ja Allocation Instrumenter’i tulemused ei olnud määrkimväärselt paremad. Ainult NetBeans profileerija said enam-vähem efektiivselt töötada sellel testil. Kõik läbi vaadatud lahendused, välja arvatud TPTP, kasutavad mälueraldamiste jälgmiseks baitkoodi manipuleerimist (ByteCode Instrumentation, BCI). Nad lisavad oma jälgimise meetodi väljakutse pärast iga objekti loomise baitkoodi (opcode new). TPTP oma tööks kasutab JVM TI sündmuseid. Erilist huvi pakkub Allocation <b>Instrumenter</b> Google’st. See raamistik võimaldab kirjutada mälueraldamiste jälgijat puhtas Java keeles. Potensiaalselt see teeb lahendus platvorimst sõltumatuks. Kuid veel eksisteerivad lahendamata probleeme jõudlusega. Minu tulevikuplaanis on aru saada, kas saab teha mälueraldamiste jälgimist. Memory leaks in Java are not {{the same}} as memory leaks in, for example, the C programming language. When a C-programmer wants to use memory on the heap, he should manually allocate a memory region. After application finishes using this memory, it should be manually freed. If the pointer to the allocated region is lost, then there is no appropriate way to release this memory. This situation is called a “memory leak”. In Java the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles all work with memory. When a developer wants to create and use a new object, the JVM allocates a necessary amount of memory. During an application’s life the JVM periodically checks for objects in memory that are not used anymore. Objects, which are not referenced, will be discarded and memory reclaimed to be used again. This process is called garbage collection. A memory leak in Java is a situation, where an application is not logically using objects, to which references still exist, meaning the Garbage Collector (GC) can’t mark them as unused and free memory. When memory management of JVM cannot allocate any more memory, java. lang. OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. When a developer is faced with an “OutOfMemoryError” on production server, he can try to reproduce the problem in a test environment. Unfortunately, oftentimes test environments do not allow for reproduction of such errors. It’s not always possible to mimic all parameters of a real environment. Developer often doesn’t have all required input data or he just does not know how and why the memory leak occurred. This can be also caused by all sorts of bureaucratic obstacles and barriers in large companies with separate operations and development departments and developers just do not have full access to machines in a real environment. However, even if it is possible to search for memory leaks in a production environment – use of many developer’s tools, such as full-featured profilers is not possible, due to the memory and performance overhead not suitable for production environment. It is useful to apply all possible offline methods, such as analysis of heap dumps and collection of allocations’ logs. And when a memory leak is localized, only then it would be helpful to turn on an allocation tracker for a specific set of objects or allocation sites to find out what code is responsible for creating objects that are eventually leaked. In order to do it in a production environment, we need effective methods and algorithms for allocation tracking. Memory allocations tracker is a tool, which works in runtime and logs memory allocation by specific objects or sites. Usually it is a part of a profiler, but standalone solutions also exist. The aim of this work is to review and compare existing open source solutions for allocation tracking in JVM. The first chapter of this work describes benchmarking techniques, which will be used for comparison of different allocations trackers. In this work will SPECjvm 2008 will be used. It is a benchmark suite for measuring the performance of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It contains several real life applications and benchmarks focusing on core java functionality. The SPECjvm 2008 workload mimics a variety of common general-purpose application computations. As SPECjvm 2008 does not give any information about memory usage a lightweight JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent was created. JVM TI allows a program to inspect the state and to control the execution of other application running in the JVM [1]. The agent works in a separate thread and writes memory usage statistics to a CSV file every second. The agent creates an insignificant overhead, so it does not distort the SPECjvm 2008 results. In the next chapters of this work open-source allocations trackers are reviewed. Their work principles, algorithms and memory structures are examined. For measuring allocations tracking efficiency the SPECjvm 2008 suite will be run with every tested allocations tracking solution. The obtained data allows comparing memory and performance overhead of different approaches in memory allocations tracking. Chapter 2 introduces HPROF – an example profiler, shipped with the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) and uses the JVM TI. In chapter 3 we review the NetBeans profiler, previously known as JFluid. This is full-weight Java profiler integrated with the NetBeans IDE. Chapter 4 is about Eclipse Test and Performance platform. This is a collection of open- source frameworks and services that allows software developers to build test and performance tools. In the last chapter results of using Google’s Allocation <b>Instrumenter</b> are presented. It uses java. lang. instrument package and ASM Java byte code manipulation and analysis framework. For each examined profiler brief description along with implementation details and benchmarking results are given...|$|E

40|$|Klimafremskrivninger varsler en fremtid med hyppigere og mer intense nedbørhendelser. Stadig utbygging av flere sentrumsnære boliger medfører høyere grad av fortetting, og skaper store avrenningsvolum som infrastrukturen ofte ikke er dimensjonert for å takle. Store investeringskostnader knyttet til oppgradering av ledningsnett fremmer nytenking, og resulterer i at overvann i større grad håndteres lokalt. Denne oppgaven omhandler regnbed som tiltak for overvannshåndtering. Regnbed kan beskrives som en beplantet nedsenkning i terrenget, hvor det forekommer infiltrasjon og fordrøyning av overvann. Per i dag er regnbed et lite kjent og benyttet overvannstiltak i Norge. Tre regnbed i småhusbebyggelse ble undersøkt med hovedfokus på hydrologisk ytelse under norske forhold. To regnbed i Oslo og ett i Melhus kommune utgjorde testobjektene i feltarbeidet, der geometrisk oppmåling, infiltrasjonsmålinger og vannføringsmålinger ble utført. Installerte <b>instrumenter</b> logget naturlige nedbørhendelser i regnbedene. Forsøkene knyttet til hydrologisk ytelse ble gjennomført ved å utsette regnbedene for kraftig hydraulisk belastning (syntetisk nedbør). Det ble etterstrebet at tilførte vannmengder skulle tilsvare nedbørhendelser med 25 - 50 års gjentaksintervall. Regnbedenes hydrologiske ytelse ble bestemt ved blant annet måling av videreført vannføring og dreneringstid. Målingene ga grunnlag for beregning av flomtoppreduksjon og forsinkelsestid. Observasjoner fra feltarbeid ble i tillegg benyttet i hydrologiske {{modeller}} for å simulere nedbørhendelser utover observasjonsgrunnlaget. Resultater fra simulert syntetisk nedbør viser en betydelig demping av kraftige nedbørhendelser opp til 50 års gjentaksintervall. Resultater fra modellering viser at regnbedene er sårbare overfor nedbør med høy intensitet og kort varighet. Regnbedenes geometri spiller en viktig rolle for god hydrologisk ytelse. Ved bruk av større overflateareal viser resultatene forholdsvis god tilbakeholdelse. Storskalaimplementering av regnbed i et eksisterende delfelt i Veumdalen i Fredrikstad kommune, viser at regnbedene holdt tilbake hele 20 års regnet. Dette ga en betydelig vannføringsreduksjon ut av delfeltet. I nedbørfelt med høy andel impermeable flater, bør imidlertid ytterligere overvannstiltak vurderes for å oppnå tilfredsstillende reduksjon av vannføring. Regnbedets ytelse under kalde forhold påvirkes ikke nødvendigvis av frost i jorden. Imidlertid kan frosttypen være av stor betydning. Porøs og granulær frost kan ha god infiltrasjonsevne, grunnet åpne porekanaler. Betongfrost er derimot impermeabel, og kan svekke hydrologisk ytelse betydelig. Frosttypen avhenger av grad av vannmetning, temperatur og jordtekstur i filtermedia. Observasjoner kan tyde på at regnbed fungerer bra under kalde forhold, med forbehold om god vannledningsevne under varme forhold og lavt vanninnhold ved temperaturer under 0 °C. Climate projections foresee {{more frequent}} and intense precipitation events in the future. An increasing development of centrally located housing involves {{a higher degree of}} densification, and creates large runoff volumes that infrastructure is often not designed to handle. Large investment costs associated with upgrading the pipeline network promotes innovation, handling the stormwater locally. This thesis treats rain gardens as measures for stormwater management. Rain gardens can be described as a planted depression in the ground, which allows infiltration and retention of stormwater runoff. Today rain gardens are little known and rarely used as a stormwater measure in Norway. Three rain gardens in areas with individual housing were studied, focusing on hydrological performance under Norwegian conditions. The field investigations were conducted in the municipalities of Oslo and Melhus. Geometric-, infiltration- and flow measurements were performed at each site, and installed instruments logged actual precipitation events in the rain gardens. The experiments related to the hydrological performance were conducted by exposing the rain gardens to a heavy hydraulic load (synthetic precipitation). It was pursued to make the supplied water volumes correspond to precipitation events with a 25 - 50 year return period. Hydrological performance was determined by measurement of the outlet flow and filter bed drain time. The measurements provided the basis for the calculation of peak flow reduction and retention time. Observations from the field investigations were additionally applied in hydrological models, to simulate rainfall events beyond the observational basis. Results from the simulated synthetic precipitation show a significant reduction of heavy precipitation events up to a 50 year return period. Results from modeling simulations show that rain gardens are vulnerable with regard to precipitation with high intensity and short duration. The geometry features {{an important role in the}} hydrologic performance of rain gardens. The results show a fairly satisfactory retention, using a larger surface area. Large-scale implementation of rain gardens in an existing sub-catchment in Veumdalen, Fredrikstad. Model results show that the rain gardens retained a precipitation event with a 20 year return period. This reduced the water flow out of the sub-catchment significantly. In order to achieve satisfactory reduction of discharge from sub-catchment with high proportion of impermeable surfaces, additional storm water measures should be considered. The performance of rain gardens during cold climate conditions is not necessarily affected by the presence of soil frost. The frost type however, is of great importance. Porous and granular frost may provide a high infiltration capacity, due to open pore canals in the soil. Concrete frost however, appears impermeable and may impair the hydrological performance significantly. The frost type depends on the degree of water saturation, temperature and soil texture in the filter media. Observations suggest that rain gardens perform well under cold conditions, subject to high hydraulic conductivity under warm conditions and low water content at temperatures below 0 °C...|$|E

International educational research influences national educational and political discourses, and new assessment procedures, principles and techniques are being implemented in all school subjects, including music. Yet, assessment in music is traditional seen as a difficult endeavour, in many cases also as something incompatible with the fun and joyful aspects of engaging with music. Furthermore, assessment in music education has received little attention in Nordic literature of and research into music didactics. As a result, there is little research‐based knowledge about the kinds of assessment practices and strategies in use; how the teachers experience them; and how the enhanced focus on assessment, in all its forms and shapes, influences the subject’s content and teaching methods. This presentation will cover the main aspects and findings of a Ph. D. research project carried out in the period 2009 -­‐ 2013. The research aimed to describe and understand assessment practices within the compulsory subject of music in lower secondary schools in Norway (age 13 -­‐ 16). In this project the concept of assessment was investigated explorative and in a broad context, covering both formative and summative assessment, and also the relationship between these two concepts. The empirical data were collected from in-­‐depth interviews and document analyses of 14 music teachers, all working within the same school district in the eastern part of Norway and representing different educational backgrounds and work experiences. Using theoretical insights from general assessment theory (Sadler; Eisner, Black & Wiliam; Hattie), didactical theory (Heimann, Schulz & Otto; Lundgren; Jank & Meyer) and practice theory (Bourdieu), the analysis has pursued to answer the following research questions: • How is assessment carried out within the compulsory subject of music in lower secondary school? • What are the teachers’ attitudes towards, and main challenges of assessment? • What seems to be the central factors regulating and constraining the assessment practices? • How do various assessment regulations influence the music teachers’ choices of musical content and learning activities? The main findings from the research suggest that there has been a clear tendency of moving towards systematic criterion based assessment practices in Norway since the implementation of the latest curriculum reform (LK 06, The Knowledge Reform). The teachers welcome, and put to use, new assessment principles and techniques for enhancing student learning, the so-­‐called assessment for learning concept. Still, the analysis indicates that these principles and techniques become most relevant when they are used in grading procedures – assessment of learning. The teachers report challenges regarding the formulation of adequate assessment criteria for the different learning activities and to communicate these to the students. But having done this, the teachers find the enhanced use of rubrics and quality descriptors as empowering in the summative manner. The main challenge for music teachers has always been to address assessment in a transparent, objective manner and to include all aspects of musical learning (e. g. the aesthetic, creative, emotional, musical) in the assessment practice. The findings of the current study suggest that different kinds of ideological, economic and juridical structures surrounding the music subject, in combination with the teachers’ musical and pedagogical competencies, constitute the construction of different kinds of didactical self defence strategies used by the teachers to negation between the students, the subject and their own needs and intentions. - * - * - * - * - Sammendrag: Elevvurdering har fått økt internasjonalt fokus på 2000 -tallet og preger nå norsk skole på mange måter.

40|$|Norsk sammendrag - Norsk tittel: Aktigrafi ved stemningslidelser Det er i dag ingen objektive mål på symptomene ved psykiske lidelser. I dette doktorgradsarbeidet er det vist at mennesker med ulike former for depresjoner og manier har bevegelsesmønstre som skiller seg fra hverandre. Akuttinnlagte pasienter med stemningslidelser (bipolar lidelse og depresjon) har gått med en bevegelsesmåler (aktigraf) i 24 timer under innleggelse ved avdeling Østmarka, St Olavs Hospital. Ved bruk av avanserte matematiske metoder ble mengde bevegelse, grad av variasjon og stabilitet av aktivitet beregnet. Ved alle depresjonstyper var det lav gjennomsnittsaktivitet og høy variasjon av aktivitet sammenlignet med hos friske personer. Det var også objektive forskjeller i aktivitetsmønstre mellom de pasientene med depresjon som etter legenes vurdering hadde langsomme kroppsbevegelser (såkalt psykomotorisk retardasjon) og deprimerte som var motorisk urolige. De deprimerte pasientene som var mer urolige, hadde et uorganisert bevegelsesmønster som lignet mønsteret for pasienter med mani. I en annen studie av pasienter som var i stabil fase av bipolar lidelse og som samtidig hadde søvnvansker, fant vi at de som ikke hadde stabil døgnrytme, var yngre, og en større andel hadde forsinket søvnfase og hyppige dag-til-dag-forandringer i stemningsleie. Det var også forskjeller i bevegelsesmønstrene mellom gruppene. Analyser av bevegelsesmønstre målt ved hjelp av <b>instrumenter</b> på størrelse med et armbåndsur, kan trolig utvikles til å skille undergrupper med stemningslidelser fra hverandre og få betydning for klassifisering og behandling av depresjoner og manier både ved tilbakevendende depresjoner og ved bipolar lidelse. Summary - Introduction and aims: Affective disorders, {{characterized}} by recurrent episodes of low and/or elevated mood, {{are among the}} most costly and burdensome chronic diseases. Diagnostic categories and episodespecific symptoms overlap, and prevention of illness progression is hampered by an inability to detect early signs of new episodes in due time. Psychiatry as a medical discipline is uniquely dependent on clinical observation of signs and symptoms with few objective markers of disease. In all states of affective disorders, there are variations in mood symptoms, sleep, circadian rhythms and motor activity. While mood is an ambiguous and subjective symptom, circadian rhythms and motor activity patterns are objectively assessable via the use of actigraphy. Actigraphs are convenient and non-invasive devices for monitoring wrist movement, and they are increasingly employed in psychiatric settings to record sleep-wake and motor activity rhythms. To date, analytical methods have focused on mean levels and simple variability measures. This thesis aimed to analyze motor activity patterns in inpatients and outpatients with affective disorders, using linear and non-linear mathematical methods, in order to compare groups of patients defined by phenotypes. Methods: In two studies, 24 -hour actigraphically recorded motor activity patterns in acutely admitted inpatients with affective disorders and recordings from healthy controls were included. In the first study, 52 patients with unipolar depression were divided into groups with and without clinically assessed motor retardation. The second study included 30 patients with mania or bipolar depression. In a third study, 1 -week actigraphy recordings in 43 outpatients with euthymic bipolar disorder and subjective sleep disturbance were compared between groups with actigraphically determined stable and unstable rest-activity cycles. Actigraphy recordings were compared to concurrent reports of mood and sleep. In all studies, motor activity patterns were analyzed by measures of variability (standard deviation (SD), root mean square successive difference (RMSSD), RMSSD/SD ratio). Studies I and II additionally employed other measures of variability (autocorrelation lag 1, Fourier analysis) and complexity (sample entropy, symbolic dynamics) and other non-linear methods for studying the distribution of active and inactive periods. Results: Within the unipolar depression sample, patients with motor retardation had reduced activity levels and higher intra-individual variability in activity compared to patients without motor retardation. Motor retardation implied being active in shorter bursts with fewer long bursts of activity. Patients without motor retardation displayed increased complexity in activity during an active morning sequence of approximately one hour. Bipolar depression was {{characterized by}} significantly lower mean activity and higher variability compared to healthy controls, similar to all depression groups relative to controls. Patients with mania showed higher minute-to-minute variability (higher RMSSD values) during 24 hours compared to healthy controls, and increased complexity (higher sample entropy) during the active morning sequence compared to patients with bipolar depression. In euthymic bipolar disorder and sleep disturbance, a subgroup of patients demonstrated unstable rest-activity cycles in combination with variability in mood and motor activity patterns. The unstable subgroup was younger and showed delayed sleep phases compared to the group with stable rest-activity cycles. Discussion: Patients with unipolar depression with and without motor retardation differed in 24 -hour activity patterns, and the two phenotypes could be distinguished by complementary methods. Findings in unipolar depression without motor retardation resembled findings in the manic state, which further resembled findings from previous studies of schizophrenia and glutamate antagonism. Results from the euthymic bipolar group with unstable rest-activity cycles resembled variability findings in activity during affective episodes. Here, the activity findings could be associated to mood variability and/or circadian instability. In conclusion, activity characteristics are potentially important clinical signatures of affective disorders, and {{it may be possible to}} distinguish phenotypically different subgroups based on activity levels and patterns. Actigraphy recordings combined with a set of advanced analytical methods from linear and non-linear dynamics could provide a future diagnostic and prognostic tool in affective disorders, of importance to the accuracy of diagnostics, treatment response, prevention and classification of disease...|$|E

40|$|Lead-based {{piezoelectric}} ceramics {{are applied}} extensively in electromechanical devices. While lead-free alternatives are available, their performance and/or reliability {{have not yet}} been developed {{to the extent that they}} are suitable for commercialisation and the widespread replacement of lead-based piezoceramics. The aim of this thesis is to investigate preferential grain orientation (texture) as a route for improving lead-free piezoelectric ceramics based on K 0. 5 Na 0. 5 NbO 3 (KNN) and Ca, Zr-doped BaTiO 3. Importantly, this thesis demonstrates that electromechanical property improvement through texturing is contingent on utilising the direction of highest texture, which must also be the crystallographic direction in which the piezoelectric response is maximised. KNN-based materials are known to suffer from processing challenges. In this work, spray pyrolysis was used to produce large amounts of fine (~ 100 nm) KNN powder. Despite starting with fine powders, challenges similar to those reported for conventionally prepared KNN powders (low densification and non-stoichiometry) were encountered. Intentionally non-stoichiometric KNN was also synthesised to study the effect of non-stoichiometry on powder and densification properties; neither excess alkali nor Nb improved the density. Large cuboidal grains and rapid densification at low temperatures (~ 650 °C) observed in alkali-excess KNN suggest the presence of a liquid phase during heating to the sintering temperature. This liquid phase is proposed to consist of alkali hydroxides and/or carbonates from reactions of the excess alkali with atmospheric water and CO 2. Critically, the liquid formed through the melting of these species during heating results in coarsening, which consequently limits the further densification of alkali-excess KNN. Furthermore, it is proposed that both the formation of cuboidal grains and sintering challenges in stoichiometric KNN are also caused by the same mechanisms as for alkali-excess KNN. In addition, this mechanism also provides an explanation for the increased density and more uniform microstructures previously observed when sintering KNN in reducing atmospheres, as one would expect the alkali hydroxides and/or carbonates to evaporate in these conditions. As a consequence of alkali oxide evaporation at high temperatures, a Nb-rich secondary phase was observed after sintering of nominally stoichiometric KNN. The distribution of this secondary phase was dependent on the dwell time and cooling rate, and showed clear indications of the presence of a high -temperature liquid phase during sintering. Texturing has previously been demonstrated to substantially improve the piezoelectric response of KNN-based materials. By tape casting with needle-like KNN templates followed by homotemplated grain growth, 94 % dense KNN ceramics with a strong pc texture (Lotgering factor F = 86 %) parallel to the tape cast direction and a moderate (F = 28 %) pc texture normal to the tape cast plane were obtained. Enhanced piezoelectric response (d 33 = 125 ± 3 pC/N, Smax/Emax 300 pm/V) and the highest degree of domain reorientation was observed parallel to the tape cast direction compared to non-textured KNN (d 33 of 107 ± 4 pC/N, Smax/Emax 200 pm/V). Furthermore, texture reduced the dielectric nonlinearity at subcoercive fields. This suggests that pc texture enhances the piezoelectric response in KNN (in accordance with rotator ferroelectricity), introduces an advantageous domain configuration, and facilitates non- 180 ° domain reorientation at high fields. Interestingly, when the electric field was applied normal to the tape cast plane (the direction of moderate pc), lower response (d 33 = 89 ± 3 pC/N, Smax/Emax 130 pm/V) compared to both non-textured ceramics and parallel to the tape cast direction was observed. This suggests that, within a textured ceramic, strong texture in one direction might restrict the domain reorientation parallel to other directions. Superior piezoelectric response has been reported in Ba 0. 85 Ca 0. 15 Zr 0. 1 Ti 0. 9 O 3 (BCZT), yet the structure of this composition is still debated. Rietveld refinements of x-ray diffractograms of BCZT in the temperature range - 100 °C to 150 °C were performed to investigate the structure. Upon cooling, the phase sequence cubic, tetragonal, tetragonal + rhombohedral, and rhombohedral was observed. This phase sequence is consistent with previous reports of two-phase coexistence at room temperature, and extends the temperature range of the phase-coexistence to well below room temperature. In addition, the diffractograms also showed evidence of thermal history-dependent strain from domain walls Texture was studied in Ba 0. 92 Ca 0. 08 TiO 3 (BCT) due to the wider temperature range of the tetragonal phase in this composition compared to BCZT. -textured (F of up to 99 %) and -textured (F of up to 84 %) BCT were prepared by tape casting and templated grain growth using BaTiO 3 platelet templates. The largest piezoelectric response was obtained in the -textured BCT (Smax/Emax of up to 621 pm/V and d 33 of up to 238 pC/N), and the lowest in the -textured (Smax/Emax of up to 234 pm/V and d 33 of up to 113 pC/N), compared to non-textured BCT (Smax/Emax of up to 336 pm/V and d 33 of up to 155 pC/N). The large response in the -textured BCT persisted upon heating to 100 °C, which contributes to its potential as a viable lead-free piezoelectric. The order of response with the type of grain configuration correlates with a hypothesis of extender ferroelectricity in BCT, based on the behaviour of BaTiO 3 at temperatures significantly above the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition. This demonstrates that considerations of the piezoelectric anisotropy and rotator/extender ferroelectricity are necessary in the optimisation of textured lead-free piezoelectrics. Remarkably, poling at high temperatures improved the d 33 of the -textured while decreased the d 33 of the -textured and non-textured BCT ceramics. Framstilling og karakterisering av kornorienterte blyfrie piezoelektriske materialer Elektroniske <b>instrumenter</b> og utstyr, inkludert det meste av forbrukerelektronikk, inneholder en rekke helse- og miljøskadelige stoffer som for eksempel blyoksider i piezoelektriske materialer. Piezoelektriske materialer deformeres når de påføres elektrisk spenning, eller motsatt, genererer elektrisk spenning når de deformeres. Denne egenskapen gjør at disse materialene anvendes for eksempel til å nøyaktig dosere ut blekk i blekkskrivere eller til å sende og motta ultralydbølger til medisinsk avbildning. Det finnes blyfrie piezoelektriske materialer, men ennå ikke med tilstrekkelig funksjonalitet til å kunne erstatte de dominerende blyholdige. Denne doktoravhandlingen omhandler i hovedsak orientering av kornene – eller byggesteinene - i blyfrie keramiske piezoelektriske materialer. Hvis alle kornene i materialet er orientert i samme retning, kan man påføre elektrisk spenning i den mest optimale retningen og dermed oppnå bedre respons enn når alle kornene er tilfeldig orientert. Blyfrie piezoelektriske keramiske materialer med en spesiell kornorientering ble i dette arbeidet framstilt ved å orientere store, plate- eller nåleformede partikler i samme retning i en blanding av små partikler. Ved påfølgende varmebehandling gror de små partiklene i samme retning som de store, og materialet får en ordnet struktur. To ulike typer keramiske materialer ble undersøkt, ett bestående av grunnstoffene kalium, natrium, niob og oksygen, det andre av barium, titan, kalsium og oksygen. I begge systemene førte den spesielle orienteringen til høyere piezoelektrisk respons (mer deformering ved påført elektrisk spenning) i noen retninger sammenlignet med materialer med en tilfeldig kornorientering. I tillegg til arbeidet med å lage en spesiell kornorientering ble strukturen på atomnivå studert ved bruk av røntgenstråler med høy energi, og forbedrede fremstillingsmetoder for tette, blyfrie piezoelektriske keramer ble utviklet. Alt i alt bidrar denne doktoravhandlingen til å øke forståelsen av blyfrie piezoelektriske materialer og med det bidra til utviklingen av mer miljøvennlig elektronikk.

40|$|Background: This {{study is}} {{initiated}} in co-operation with the user-organization and deals with psychosocial issues concerning patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). MFS is a severe, potentially life-threatening, genetic, connective tissue disorder that commonly affects the following organ systems: aorta, ocular (eye), skeletal, dural sac, lungs and skin. There is no medical cure but improvement in medical management and surgery {{has resulted in}} increased life expectancy. The psychosocial aspects of the diagnosis have received little attention. Increased knowledge is important for developing new rehabilitation programs and services {{to improve the quality}} of life of people with MFS, as well and other patient groups. The metatheoretical perspective of this study is based on critical realism, and different models and theories within social work and health science are combined to provide better understanding and explaining of the results of the study. Purpose: To systematically review and present the knowledge bases with regard to psychosocial aspects [Paper I] and chronic pain [Paper II] of patients with Marfan syndrome. A further aim was to investigate psychosocial aspects and perceived health problems of adults registered with verified Marfan diagnosis, mainly focusing on work participation, satisfaction with life (SWL), chronic pain and fatigue [Paper III- VI]. Materials and Methods: A mixed-method systematic review of the literature pertaining to the psychosocial aspects of Marfan syndrome [Paper I] and a systematic review of chronic pain in Marfan syndrome [Paper II] were carried out. A cross-sectional postal survey [Paper III-VI] was conducted. A questionnaire was designed, including questions about demographic contact with health and social services, MFS-related health problems, satisfaction with life, chronic pain and fatigue. The questionnaire was subsequently evaluated in focus groups discussion and pilot study. All the patients (> 20 years of age) registered at TRS with verified diagnosis (n= 117) were invited to participate (62 % response rate). Paper III: Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate work participation and associated factors. Paper IV: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the dependent satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and relevant independent variables. Paper V: Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between chronic pain and associated factors. Paper VI: Multiple linear regression analysis was used to study the association between fatigue and associated factors. Results: The review [Paper I] revealed that studies regarding the psychosocial aspects of MFS are limited in size and quality. Despite these limitations, all identified studies indicate that MFS has significant impact on the psychosocial aspects of people`s lives, decreased quality of life, challenges in education, work and family life, depression and anxiety. Some studies also indicate that the subjective perception of discomfort does not necessarily match the medical severity of the disease. The review of chronic pain [Paper II] showed that few studies have examined chronic pain in patients with MFS. Despite the fact that knowledge is limited, the studies indicate that the prevalence of chronic pain in MFS is significantly higher than for the general population, and that chronic pain has a negative impact on people`s lives. The results from the cross-sectional part of this research project showed that most young adults with MFS worked full time despite comprehensive health problems, but they tended to retire earlier than did the general Norwegian population (GNP). Only severe fatigue, lower educational level and higher age were significantly associated with decreased work participation in the regression analyses. The mean score of SWLS in our study group was lower than that of the GNP, but similar or higher when compared to other patient groups. Aortic dissection and severe fatigue were significantly associated with decreased SWLS in the hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The prevalence of chronic pain and fatigue in adults with MFS was high. Many reported that the chronic pain had occurred at a young age. Conclusion: This research project indicates that people with MFS may experience psychosocial challenges due to the diagnosis and that perceived health problems such as chronic pain and fatigue are common. Despite comprehensive health problems, it seems that many people with MFS cope well with the diagnosis. Severe fatigue was the health problem having the highest significant association with lower work participation, decreased SWLS and chronic pain. This confirms the view that fatigue is a major issue for this patient group, but the associations are complex. This research project highlights that medical social work plays an important role in the field of chronic illness and disability, and biopsycosocial approach is recommended. Studies of rare diagnoses are challenging due to small sample sizes and recruiting challenges. International collaborative studies, using the same study design and validated tools, and only including people with verified diagnosis are recommended. This may contribute to a deeper and broader understanding of the psychosocial aspects of the MFS, also across diverse cultures and ethnic groups. Bakgrunn: Denne studien som er initiert i samarbeid med brukerforeningen omhandler psykososiale forhold ved diagnosen Marfan syndrom (MFS). MFS er en alvorlig potensiell livstruende genetisk bindevevstilstand som ofte påvirker aorta/hjerte, syn (øye), skjelett, lunger og hud. Det finnes ingen helbredende behandling, men behandling med ȕ-blokkere eller annen blodtrykksmedisin og operasjon med innsettelse av kunstig hovedpulsåre har ført til økt livslengde. De psykososiale følgende av diagnosen har hatt lite oppmerksomhet. Økt kunnskap er viktig for å kunne utvikle bedre rehabilitering og tilpassede tjenester som kan bidra til å øke livskvalitet for mennesker med MFS, så vel som andre pasientgrupper. Studien tar utgangspunkt i et meta-teoretisk perspektiv basert på kritisk realisme. Ulike modeller og teorier innenfor sosialt arbeid og helsevitenskap er kombinert for å gi økt forståelse og innsikt i de problemstillingene som diskuteres ut fra resultatene fra studien. Hensikt: Å få systematisk oversikt over relevant forskning som omhandler psykososiale forhold ved MFS [Artikkel I] og kronisk smerte ved MFS [Artikkel II]. Deretter, undersøke psykososiale aspekt og opplevde helseplager for voksne personer med bekreftet Marfan diagnose, med fokus på arbeidsdeltakelse, fornøydhet med livet, kronisk smerte og fatigue [Artikkel III-VI]. Materiale og metode: Systematiske søk, kvalitetsvurdering og oppsummering av relevant forskning ble foretatt [Artikkel I, II]. Tverssnittstudie med spørreskjema som inkluderte spørsmål knyttet til demografiske forhold, kontakt med helse- og sosial service, MFS-relaterte helseforhold, fornøydhet med livet, kronisk smerte og fatigue ble gjennomført [Artikkel III, IV, V, VI]. Alle pasienter (> 20 år) som var registret med verifisert MFS diagnose (n= 117) ble invitert til å delta, 62 % deltok. Artikkel III – Multippel logistisk regresjonsanalyse ble brukt til å identifisere faktorer som har sammenheng med arbeidsdeltakelse. Artikkel IV- Hierarkisk regresjonsanalyse ble brukt for å undersøke sammenheng mellom SWLS og relevante uavhengig variabler. Artikkel V-. Multippel logistisk regresjonsanalyse ble benyttet for å undersøke sammenheng mellom kronisk smerte og andre faktorer. Artikkel VI – Multippel lineær regresjonsanalyse ble brukt for å studere sammenheng mellom fatigue og andre relevante faktorer Resultater: Den systematiske kunnskapsoppsummering om psykososiale forhold ved MFS [Artikkel 1] viste at studier som omhandler dette temaet er begrenset både i antall og kvalitet. Til tross for disse begrensningene, indikerte studiene at MFS har stor innvirkning på psykososiale forhold som for eksempel lavere livskvalitet, utfordringer i utdanning, arbeid og familie liv og psykologiske forhold. Noen studier vektla også at folks subjektiv opplevelse av ubehag ikke nødvendigvis samsvarer med den medisinske alvorlighetsgraden av diagnosen. Den systematiske kunnskapsoppsummeringen av kroniske smerter [Artikkel II] viste at få studier har undersøkt kronisk smerte ved MFS. Til tross for begrenset kunnskap, viste studiene at prevalensen av kroniske smerter hos personer med MFS er signifikant høyere enn blant den generelle befolkningen og indikerer at kronisk smerter har negativ innvirkning på dagliglivet. Resultatene fra tverrsnittstudien tyder på at de fleste unge voksne med MFS arbeider full tid til tross for omfattende helseplager, men at mange blir uføretrygdet tidligere enn befolkningen generelt. Kun alvorlig fatigue, lavere utdannelsesnivå og høyere alder hadde signifikant sammenheng med nedsatt arbeidsdeltakelse, ikke MFS relaterte helseproblemer eller kronisk smerte. Gjennomsnittskåren for SWLS i studiegruppen var lavere enn for generelle norske befolkningen, men tilsvarende eller høyere sammenlignet med andre pasientgrupper. Kun aorta disseksjon og alvorlig fatigue hadde signifikant sammenheng med lavere SWLS. Både prevalens av kronisk smerter og fatigue var signifikant høyere i studiegruppen enn blant befolkningen generelt, men tilsvarende eller lavere enn for andre tilsvarende pasientgrupper. Mange beskrev at både kroniske smerter og fatigue begrenset dagliglivet, og smerter hadde signifikant sammenheng med fatigue. Konklusjon: Resultatene fra studien tyder på at mennesker med MFS opplever psykososiale utfordringer knyttet til diagnosen, og at helseplager som kronisk smerte og fatigue er utbredt. Til tross for at mange har omfattende helseplager ser det ut til at de mange mestrer å leve godt med diagnosen. Mye tyder på at fatigue er det helseproblemet som i størst grad er assosiert med lavere arbeidsdeltakelse og nedsatt fornøydhet med livet. Dette bekrefter at fatigue er et utbredt problem for pasient gruppen, men at sammenhengen er kompleks. Studien bekrefter at medisinsk sosialt arbeid er viktig i arbeidet med kronisk syke og funksjonshemmede, og en biopsykososial tilnærming vil være hensiktsmessig. Studier av sjeldne diagnoser er utfordrende på grunn av liten populasjon og rekrutteringsutfordringer. Internasjonale samarbeidsprosjekter som benytter sammen studie design, validerte <b>instrumenter</b> og inkluderer personer med verifisert diagnoser vil være en fordel. Dette, kombinert med kvalitative studier vil bidra til en bredere og dypere forståelse av de psykososiale aspektene ved MFS og andre tilsvarende diagnosegrupper i ulike kulturer og etniske grupper...|$|E
