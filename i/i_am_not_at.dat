25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well this is a new constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
500|$|The {{critic for}} The Spectator felt that [...] "Ian Fleming {{has taken a}} hint from films of his books and is now {{inclined}} to send himself up. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all sure that he is wise", while The Belfast Telegraph considered that Fleming was [...] "still {{in a class of}} his own." [...] The Bookman declared that You Only Live Twice [...] "must rank among the best of the Bonds". Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in Esquire magazine disagreed, writing that [...] "You Only Live Twice has a decidedly perfunctory air. Bond can only manage to sleep with his Japanese girl with the aid of colour pornography. His drinking sessions seem somehow desperate, and the horrors are too absurd to horrify... it's all rather a muddle and scarcely in the tradition of Secret Service fiction. Perhaps the earlier novels are better. If so, I shall never know, having no intention of reading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Baldwin {{is as much}} {{a member}} of the Chicago Club as any man on it and we signed him for the season of 1886 (sic.) and 1887 as well. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all {{satisfied}} with the result of today's business, and I think the action of Mr. Von der Ahe in the matter was unsportsmanlike and wrong, and if the loss of this game interferes with our winning the series, I think it would be only right to make some kind of a protest against it." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I saw the {{mackerel}} fleet on its fishing-ground, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> first {{aware of}} it. So my experience was complete.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> sorry <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> {{home when}} you arrived," [...] Featherstone said. [...] "Still, I {{had no reason}} for {{thinking}} you would be here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must be {{here when}} she needs me," [...] he repeated. [...] "It would be dreadful if {{something}} terrible happened and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> hand." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{fracturing}} {{his left}} tibia during training on 27 November 2013, Tamgho was immediately {{sent to the}} Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, where he successfully underwent surgery on his left tibia on the following day. On 13 December 2013 {{at a press conference}} in Paris, Tamgho announced that he would miss the entire 2014 athletics season in order to recover fully from his left tibia surgery. [...] "My goal is to be number one and I will not enter any competition if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> 100 percent of my capabilities. I do not want to rush things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cricket of {{the period}} did feature {{numerous}} great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, C. B. Fry, Ranjitsinhji and Frank Woolley, but {{that in itself is}} not unique as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia [...] "needed someone to put a perspective on it". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "I have a notion that the cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to watch, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all sure that the game of today is not more difficult to play".|$|E
2500|$|Sakharov {{never felt}} that by {{creating}} nuclear weapons he had [...] "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote: [...] "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... Each of us {{has a responsibility to}} think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E
5000|$|... said: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{very much}} at home in his heart. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all {{surprised}} at this, because I know he loves Jesus very much. (879) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, Eleanor: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> work, though; my brain, my eyes, {{and hands}} <b>were</b> all tired. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> sitting idle for, I believe, this half hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{so sorry}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home when you called, Glastonbury,' said his Grace; 'but I thought I should soon hear {{of you at}} grandmamma's.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In the Navy's view, the {{evolution}} of the armored cruiser from the New York and Brooklyn to the Tennessee class was a progression toward [...] "what was in reality a battle-cruiser." [...] As such, it claimed, the Tennessees [...] "excelled in battery power and protection any armored cruiser built, building, or designed, in the world at that time." [...] The issue of speed did not go away and the Tennessees were criticized within the Bureau of Construction and Repair for being slower than their British and French counterparts. Engineer in Chief Melville stated in his minority report, [...] "I cannot believe that Congress did not intend that these vessels should be equal to or superior to any of their class, that class being armored cruisers, and not battleships where very high speed may not be so essential; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all certain that an additional knot and the power for it should not have been insisted upon in the first place." ...|$|E
60|$|GRACE (sitting down placidly). <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all miserable. I'm sorry; but I shan't {{break my}} heart.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all romantic. I am not old enough. I leave romance to my seniors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; indeed <b>I</b> did <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all {{angry with}} you. Indeed, why should <b>I</b> have <b>been?</b> It was so kind of you, wishing {{to dance with}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg pardon, Miss Melbury," [...] he said. [...] "I saw {{you from}} the window, and fancied you might imagine that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home--if it <b>is</b> <b>I</b> you <b>were</b> coming for." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{we walked}} away, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> ease, but <b>was</b> saying to myself, [...] "He {{told them he}} was {{laughing}} at them, {{but it was a}} lie--he was laughing at me." ...|$|R
60|$|But let me confess, in parenthesis, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> {{all sure}} whether I don't really prefer these demons to our sanctified humanity.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Narborough hit {{him with}} her fan. [...] "Lord Henry, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all {{surprised}} that the world says that you are extremely wicked." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home. Show me the card. [Takes {{card from}} salver {{and looks at}} it.] Say I will not see him.|$|E
60|$|He cast {{one quick}} {{suspicious}} look at me--and {{led the way}} back to the booking-office without uttering another word. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all satisfied with him. I thought his conduct very strange.|$|R
6000|$|Julian {{advanced}} a few steps, instantly recovering his self-possession. [...] "I <b>am</b> sorry <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home," [...] he said, [...] "when {{you called}} with your {{letter from the}} consul. Pray take a chair." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> {{all sure}} that he was all right, and {{proposed}} that Rectus and I should go to his house in the evening, when he was at home, and talk to him about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Will {{you mind}} sending your servant across {{to call me}} at a quarter to five? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all good at waking myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your lordship is too good, but I am a mere man of {{business}} and know my position. I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home in ladies' society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a servant}} waiting close by," [...] she answered, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all afraid. Think over what I {{have said to}} you--and good-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. The fact <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I gave orders <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home to any one. Even {{my father}} had a {{comparatively}} cold reception. He complained of a draught the whole time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} {{the moment you}} {{appeared}} at the reception this afternoon." [...] She looked surprised, and said: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the reception. <b>I</b> have just arrived from Quebec, and have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in town an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have good}} news for me, my friends!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I am sure of it. How unfortunate that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> home to receive you! Tell me--don't keep me in suspense, if you please--you have {{discovered}} my skeleton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well," [...] he said presently, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all sure that adventures do not {{sometimes}} come even to Tooley Street." ...|$|E
60|$|To Chapman I will write. My {{impression}} is that I shall not subscribe to the Hood monument, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all favourable to such posthumous honours.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very indigent, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all miserable. If {{we are to}} be made miserable by that, what is the use of all our teaching?" ...|$|E
60|$|His {{brother was}} the next subject in my mind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all sure how he would take my {{speaking}} about it. I risked a question however, for all that. He made another sign of entreaty, and looked distressed again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> much <b>at</b> farming, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> much in company, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> much <b>at</b> figures, {{but perhaps}} I must own, {{since it is}} forced upon me, that I can show as fine a soldier's figure on the Esplanade as any man of the cavalry.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> Mittleham {{when she}} came over to {{announce}} her engagement, but I heard of it when Mrs. Godfrey and Attley came, forty miles an hour, over to me, and Mrs. Godfrey called me names of the worst for suppression of information.|$|R
