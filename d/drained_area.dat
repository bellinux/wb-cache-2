2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1915, {{southern}} California was experiencing a devastating drought that had <b>drained</b> <b>area</b> reservoirs to record low levels over more than three consecutive years, causing massive agricultural and ranching losses. Residents of San Diego County were so desperate that the city of San Diego hired a man called Charles Hatfield, known as [...] "the Rainmaker". The city promised Hatfield $10,000 if {{he could make it}} rain significantly {{by the end of the}} year. Hatfield's venture was apparently a success, but it is not known what actually caused the massive floods that tore through the county beginning December 9, the day after he started his ill-fated scheme.|$|E

40|$|A Field test over 11 km {{with the}} SIC {{vertical}} drain system {{was carried out}} in January 2005 up till January 2008 and placed at Skodbjerge at the Danish west coast. Already after 6 month has the vertical drain system stabilized the beach in an equilibrium profile. The average beach level from the dune foot and 100 m. wide was after 3 years up to 157 cm higher in the <b>drained</b> <b>areas</b> in relation to the reference area 2. The erosion was stopped in the <b>drained</b> <b>area’s,</b> and the sand drift increased to the dune system over the next 3 years.
