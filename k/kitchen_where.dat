5|$|The {{basement}} {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane.

In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> Finn is being held captive.

5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

Gabriel rescues Amitiel and kills the Fallen Balan who tries to rape her. He then heals her of the drugs she has been taking to dull the pain of her job. As Gabriel's use of power makes his presence known in Purgatory, the Fallen grow weary and impatient of waiting.

25|$|Today, it is run as {{a museum}} by Manx National Heritage, {{depicting}} {{the history of the}} Kings and Lords of Mann. Most rooms {{are open to the public}} during the opening season (March to October), and all open rooms have signs telling their stories. The exhibitions include a working medieval <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> authentic period food is prepared on special occasions and re-enactments of various aspects of medieval life are held on a regular basis, with particular emphasis on educating the local children about their history. Archaeological finds made during excavations in the 1980s are displayed and used as learning tools for visitors. A centre of the school activities at Castle Rushen is the recreation of the preparations and events surrounding the May 1507 visit to the castle by Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby and King of Mann. Stanley's visit in 1507 was a momentous occasion as most Kings of Mann rarely if ever visited the island, leaving the governing of the isle to lower ranking officials. The exhibitions at Castle Rushen are part of the Manx National Heritage Story of Mann collection of cultural, historical and heritage sites and attractions. In addition to its functions as a museum, the castle is still in use as an official court house.|$|E
