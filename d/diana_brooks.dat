50|$|Where Sinners Meet is a 1934 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by J. Walter Ruben and starring <b>Diana</b> Wynyard, Clive <b>Brook</b> and Billie Burke.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, an {{investigation}} into alleged price-fixing between Sotheby's and rival auction house Christie's led to a confession by Sotheby's CEO <b>Diana</b> <b>Brooks</b> of an elaborate price fixing scheme with her counterpart at Christie's, Christopher Davidge. In a plea bargain arrangement, prosecutors offered to keep her out of prison if she agreed to implicate Taubman. She did, and thereafter Taubman was convicted in a jury trial of price fixing. He was fined $7.5 million (USD) and imprisoned for ten months in 2002 for antitrust violations. [...] Taubman was released in 2003, and continued to insist on his innocence.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Christie's and Sotheby's {{admitted}} to a criminal price fixing conspiracy in violation of antitrust law, and each agreed to pay clients million in compensation for illegally coordinating the commissions they charged on sales between 1993 and early 2000. Alfred Taubman, former chairman of Sotheby's, went to prison upon being convicted {{for his part in}} the scheme. Sotheby's CEO <b>Diana</b> <b>Brooks</b> and her counterpart at Christie's, Christopher Davidge, confessed to the crime; Brooks implicated Taubman, who was fined million in addition to going to prison. After Christie's announced it was cooperating with the government in the antitrust investigation in January 2000, clients of both auction houses filed hundreds of lawsuits against them; the suits were later consolidated into one class-action suit. That autumn, the houses agreed to a million settlement in the class-action suit, with Taubman saying he would pay million of Sotheby's million share.|$|E
