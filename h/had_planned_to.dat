5|$|Alexander <b>had</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E
