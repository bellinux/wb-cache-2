This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy <b>device.</b> <b>In</b> March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E

Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed.

When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him.
