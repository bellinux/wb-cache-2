25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of <b>herbicide</b> <b>application</b> requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E

Little is known of how fall <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> impact soil conditions, insect populations, and winter and summer annual weed populations. Few studies have directly compared fall <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> to early spring applications. Therefore, field experiments were conducted in both no-till corn and soybean fields from 2004 through 2006 in central, northwest, and northeast Missouri. <b>Herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> were made in the fall and at three spring timings. Two residual and one non-residual herbicide treatment were applied at each of the four timings. Removal of winter annual weeds with the three herbicide treatments led to an increase in soil moisture just after planting, and a decrease in insect populations and feeding well after planting. Measurements of soil temperature indicated that removing winter annual weeds could increase temperatures in the spring. Fall residual herbicide treatments provided the highest level of winter annual weed control, yet provided poor control of summer annual weed species after planting. Residual <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> made at the last spring timing provided the highest level of summer annual weed control, yet provided poor winter annual weed control at planting. Residual <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> made one to two months prior to planting offered the best balance between winter and summer annual weed control. Based on the results of these experiments, no-till corn and soybean producers can obtain maximum weed control and planting conditions by applying a residual herbicide in the early spring rather than the...|$|R
25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2â€“5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that <b>herbicide</b> <b>application</b> and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTechnical and {{environmental}} constraints on agricultural practices can spatially and temporally concentrate or spread <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications,</b> thereby modifying <b>herbicide</b> losses in stream water. This study analyses {{the effect of}} such constraints on spatio-temporal patterns of sowing and weeding activities and, consequently, on herbicide losses, focusing on weeding operations in maize. Machine availability and farmer working time were considered technical constraints, while weather and soil conditions were considered environmental constraints. Simulated experiments were performed with the SACADEAU model, which combines a decision submodel with crop-growth and herbicide-transfer submodels. The decision submodel designed in conjunction with agricultural experts contains decision rules that distribute crop sowing and weeding operations among fields. The model was applied on an agricultural catchment in western Europe, {{and the results were}} analysed over nine spring periods. Simulations suggest that, in addition to reducing overall herbicide-application rates, strategies that modify spatial distribution of <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> by reducing <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> in bottomlands could be particularly effective. Temporally distributing <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications,</b> for example via collective machine management, also is effective. Finally, spatial strategies that focus activities on a given area appear to be more efficient than temporal ones that spread activities over time because the former are less dependent on weather conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{conventional}} cropping systems, {{removal of}} weed population extensively {{relies on the}} <b>application</b> of chemical <b>herbicides.</b> However, this practice should be minimized because of the adverse effects of <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications</b> on environment, human health, and other living organisms. In this context, if the distribution of broadleaf and grass weeds could be sensed locally with a machine vision system, then the selection and dosage of <b>herbicides</b> <b>applications</b> could be optimized automatically. This paper presents a simple, yet effective texture-based weed classification method using local pattern operators. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using micro-level texture patterns to classify weed images into broadleaf and grass categories for real-time selective <b>herbicide</b> <b>applications.</b> Three widely-used texture operators, namely local binary pattern (LBP), local ternary pattern (LTP), and local directional pattern (LDP) are considered in our study.

50|$|A further {{method of}} <b>herbicide</b> <b>application</b> {{developed}} around 2010, involves ridding {{the soil of}} its active weed seed bank rather than just killing the weed.

Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service found that the application of herbicides to fields late in the weeds' growing season greatly reduces their seed production, and therefore fewer weeds will return the following season. Because most weeds are annuals, their seeds will only survive in soil {{for a year or}} two, so this method will be able to destroy such weeds after a few years of <b>herbicide</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E
