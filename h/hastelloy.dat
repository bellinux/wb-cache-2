25|$|Radiation {{damage to}} nickel alloys - The {{standard}} <b>Hastelloy</b> N alloy {{was found to}} be embrittled by neutron radiation. Neutrons reacted with nickel to form helium. This helium gas concentrated at specific points inside the alloy, where it increased stresses. ORNL addressed this problem by adding 1–2% titanium or niobium to the <b>Hastelloy</b> N. This changed the alloy's internal structure so that the helium would be finely distributed. This relieved the stress and allowed the alloy to withstand considerable neutron flux. However the maximum temperature is limited to about 650°C. Development of other alloys may be required. The outer vessel wall that contains the salt can have neutronic shielding, such as boron carbide, to effectively protect it from neutron damage.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A sparge of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly uranium hexafluoride, containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling uranium hexafluoride is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than <b>Hastelloy.</b> One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a protective layer. At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility was used to remove uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid fuel elements fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like <b>Hastelloy</b> X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

50|$|COIL was {{developed}} by the US Air Force in 1977, for military purposes. However, its properties make it useful for industrial processing as well; the beam is focusable and can be transferred by an optical fiber, as its wavelength is not absorbed much by fused silica but is well absorbed by metals, making it suitable for laser cutting and drilling.

50|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining is a machining method primarily used for hard metals or those {{that would be}} very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM typically works with materials that are electrically conductive, although methods for machining insulating ceramics with EDM have also been proposed. EDM can cut intricate contours or cavities in pre-hardened steel without the need for heat treatment to soften and re-harden them. This method can be used with any other metal or metal alloy such as titanium, <b>hastelloy,</b> kovar, and inconel. Also, applications of this process to shape polycrystalline diamond tools have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Valve {{bodies are}} usually {{metallic}} or plastic. Brass, bronze, gunmetal, cast iron, steel, alloy steels and stainless steels are very common. Seawater applications, like desalination plants, often use duplex valves, {{as well as}} super duplex valves, due to their corrosion resistant properties, particularly against warm seawater. Alloy 20 valves are typically used in sulphuric acid plants, whilst monel valves are used in hydrofluoric acid (HF Acid) plants. <b>Hastelloy</b> valves are often used in high temperature applications, such as nuclear plants, whilst inconel valves are often used in hydrogen applications. Plastic bodies are used for relatively low pressures and temperatures. PVC, PP, PVDF and glass-reinforced nylon are common plastics used for valve bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{is carried out}} at 363K and 30bar oxygen partial pressure, either as pure oxygen or air. Since hot formic acid is corrosive, suitable autoclaves (e.g. <b>Hastelloy)</b> must be used. Reaction times depend on the reactivity of the feed. for example, microcristalline cellulose is converted to 15 and 22% after 24h and 66h, respectively, whereas the more reactive xylan is converted to 88% and 94% respectively.The use of additives more than doubles the reaction rates, especially for the refractory compound cellulose. If p-toluenesulfonic acid is used as the additive, conversion of cellulose rises from 22% to 68% after 66h.Under the reaction conditions, overoxidation of the produced formic acid does not occur. In another recent examples, formic acid was produced from biomass-derived sugars using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant over heterogeneous catalysts.|$|E
5000|$|The I-A {{air intake}} {{consisted}} of two peripheral slots {{which led to a}} double-sided, centrifugal compressor. A series of vanes guided the air into the impeller eyes. After radial compression, the air was diffused and turned 90 degrees rearwards, before entering a set of ten reverse-flow combustion chambers (i.e. cans). A relatively short shaft connected the compression system to the single stage axial turbine. After expansion through the turbine, the combustion products exhausted the engine through the simple conical propelling nozzle, via the jet-pipe. For the turbine section, GE used a [...] metal developed for their turbochargers, <b>Hastelloy</b> B. Problems were uncovered with overheating bearing, and solved by fitting the turbine with larger cooling blades and changing the air diffuser, as well as switching to a ram air cooling air inlet.|$|E
5000|$|An {{isothermal}} titration calorimeter {{is composed}} of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermally conducting and chemically inert material such as <b>Hastelloy</b> alloy or gold, surrounded by an adiabatic jacket. [...] Sensitive thermopile/thermocouple circuits are used to detect temperature differences between the reference cell (filled with buffer or water) and the sample cell containing the macromolecule. Prior to addition of ligand, a constant power (<1 mW) {{is applied to the}} reference cell. This directs a feedback circuit, activating a heater located on the sample cell. During the experiment, ligand is titrated into the sample cell in precisely known aliquots, causing heat to be either taken up or evolved (depending {{on the nature of the}} reaction). Measurements consist of the time-dependent input of power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference cells.|$|E

50|$|A {{machinist}} is to metal as a woodcarver is to wood. The {{most common}} materials that machinists make parts from are steel, aluminium, brass, copper, and various alloys of these materials. Other less common {{materials such as}} vanadium, zinc, lead, or manganese are often used as alloying elements for the most common materials. Materials that machinists work with occasionally are plastics, rubber, glass, and wood products. Rarely, machinists also work with exotic and refractory metals. The term exotic metals is a general term describing out of the ordinary, rare or special purpose metals. A synonym might be space-age. A list of exotic metals might include, but is not limited to, titanium, beryllium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, as well as special high-temperature metal alloys like Inconel or <b>Hastelloy</b> (superalloys). Very often {{the meaning of the}} term suggests the need for specialized handling and/or tooling to machine them effectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{hardness}} {{and density}} of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys. A {{good example is}} high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Tungsten alloys are used {{in a wide range}} of different applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding. Superalloys containing tungsten, such as <b>Hastelloy</b> and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Quenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849 - 1898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron, of course, is), when present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has an enhanced ferromagnetism, as compared to the ferrite (iron) phase, due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion.|$|E
5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, <b>Hastelloy</b> and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E
