25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually <b>go</b> <b>broke.</b> This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} the Jamaica Gleaner noted that viewers had been getting restless with Jill's newfound {{closeness}} to Katherine, noting that, [...] "Katherine and Jill {{are at their}} best when they are at each other's throats." [...] Of the storyline where she returned to Jabot Cosmetics, Cooper stated: [...] "Since I {{went back into the}} business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna <b>go</b> <b>broke?</b> Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [...] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'" [...] Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has [...] "outlived most marriages". Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. [...] It used to be, “This month I like her... this month I hate her.” [...] Now, it’s more from moment to moment." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself {{relatively}} little in government matters. His speeches were short, but to the point, and, running against the norm, he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit. The historian Peter Howell said that Playford was [...] "an unusually insolent and disloyal backbencher, always concerned to cut a figure and ridicule his party's leader". A new member's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics, but Playford's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as [...] "a casual visitor could have mistaken him" [...] for an opposition member. At one point, a visibly angry Premier Butler interjected after Playford attacked the members of the Employment Promotion Council. In his opening address, Playford individually mocked the bureaucrats who comprised various government bodies, and then condemned public transport monopolies, as well as declaring [...] "It is not our business to worry whether people <b>go</b> <b>broke</b> or not". This comment provoked interjections from both government and opposition members—in the midst of the Great Depression, Playford's unashamed and aggressive promotion of his unbridled laissez faire philosophy stood out amidst the increasing prevalence of government intervention.|$|E

2500|$|The Man Who Fell in Love {{with the}} Moon {{is a book}} in the [...] "dangerous writing" [...] style of fiction {{actively}} promoted by author Tom Spanbauer. According to Spanbauer, this is a style of writing which is deeply personal and which directly addresses issues difficult to confront for the author. [...] He explains: [...] "Dangerous writing means putting a piece of yourself in a work, going to the 'sore spot,' and discussing taboo topics, particularly sex and violence. It means writing for yourself, a concept that in the literary world was thought to make you <b>go</b> <b>broke.</b> It means exposing yourself to the tiger, not physically, but mentally." [...] The book also features a writing style Spanbauer calls [...] "going on the body". [...] As author Chuck Palahniuk, a student of Spanbauer's, has explained: [...] "Story can be a succession of tasty, smelly, touchable details. What Tom Spanbauer and Gordon Lish call 'going on the body,' to give the reader a sympathetic physical reaction, to involve the reader on a gut level." ...|$|E
