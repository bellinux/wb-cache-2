40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: C. <b>diphtheriae,</b> the gene of the <b>diphtheriae</b> toxin, the C. <b>diphtheriae</b> {{population}} structure. The {{purpose of the}} work: the {{development and use of}} the molecular-genetic methods for the indication of the <b>diphtheriae</b> infection pathogene by the presence of the <b>diphtheriae</b> toxin gene and typing C. <b>diphtheriae</b> on the base of knowledge of the cell genetic structure. The molecular-genetic approach to the diagnostics and observation of strains C. <b>diphtheriae</b> circulation has been developed. The method of the spot-hybridization possesses the high differentiation ability as compared with the immune-chemical methods with separation of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> by the toxigenous and non-toxigenous strains. The intensive spreading of individual clones of the pathogene can turn to be a prognostic sign, indicating of the epidemic trouble. The methodical recommendations "The Indication of <b>Diphtheriae</b> Toxin, Using Methods IFA and RNCA" have been approved. The complex application of the indication methods of the <b>diphtheriae</b> pathogene by the toxin and by the gene of toxinoformation allows to reveal the epidemically dangerous toxigenous strains fully.

40|$|Corynebacterium <b>diphtheriae</b> and Corynebacterium glutamicum {{each have}} one gene (cat) {{encoding}} catalase. In-frame Dcat mutants of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> and C. glutamicum were hyper-sensitive to growth inhibition and killing by H 2 O 2. InC. <b>diphtheriae</b> C 7 (b), both catalase activity and cat transcription decreased, 2 -fold during transition from exponential growth to early stationary phase. Prototypic OxyR in Escherichia coli senses oxidative stress and it activates katG transcription and catalase production {{in response to}} H 2 O 2. In contrast, exposure of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> C 7 (b) toH 2 O 2 did not stimulate transcription of cat. OxyR from C. <b>diphtheriae</b> and C. glutamicum have 52 % similarity with E. coli OxyR and contain homologs of the two cysteine residues involved in H 2 O 2 sensing by E. coli OxyR. In-frame DoxyR deletion mutants of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> C 7 (b), C. <b>diphtheriae</b> NCTC 13129, and C. glutamicum were much more resistant than their parental wild type strains to growth inhibition by H 2 O 2. In the C. <b>diphtheriae</b> C 7 (b) DoxyR mutant, cat transcripts were about 8 -fold more abundant and catalase activity was about 20 -fold greater than in the C 7 (b) wild type strain. The oxyR gene from C. <b>diphtheriae</b> or C. glutamicum, but not from E. coli, complemented the defect in DoxyR mutants of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> and C. glutamicum and decreased their H 2 O 2 resistance {{to the level of}} their parental strains.

40|$|SummaryHere, {{we report}} {{a case of}} non-toxigenic Corynebacterium <b>diphtheriae</b> in a {{previously}} healthy 14 -year-old girl that was acquired in Ethiopia and presented locally. This is the first clinical case of penicillin-resistant C. <b>diphtheriae</b> in the UK.

40|$|Invasive {{diseases}} {{caused by}} Corynebacterium <b>diphtheriae</b> {{have been described}} increasingly. Several reports indicate the destructive feature of endocarditis attributable to nontoxigenic strains. However, few reports {{have dealt with the}} pathogenicity of invasive strains. The present investigation demonstrates a phenotypic trait that may be used to identify potentially invasive strains. The study also draws attention to clinical and microbiological aspects observed in 5 cases of endocarditis due to C. <b>diphtheriae</b> that occurred outside Europe. Four cases occurred in female school-age children (7 - 14 years) treated at different hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All patients developed other complications including septicemia, renal failure and/or arthritis. Surgical treatment was performed on 2 patients for valve replacement. Lethality was observed in 40 % of the cases. Microorganisms isolated from 5 blood samples and identified as C. <b>diphtheriae</b> subsp mitis (N = 4) and C. <b>diphtheriae</b> subsp gravis (N = 1) displayed an aggregative adherence pattern to HEp- 2 cells and identical one-dimensional SDS-PAGE protein profiles. Aggregative-adhering invasive strains of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> showed 5 distinct RAPD profiles. Despite the clonal diversity, all 5 C. <b>diphtheriae</b> invasive isolates seemed to display special bacterial adhesive properties that may favor blood-barrier disruption and systemic dissemination of bacteria. In conclusion, blood isolates from patients with endocarditis exhibited a unique adhering pattern, suggesting a pathogenic role of aggregative-adhering C. <b>diphtheriae</b> of different clones in endocarditis. Accordingly, the aggregative-adherence pattern may be used as an indication of some invasive potential of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> strains...|$|R
5|$|Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō {{discovered}} in 1890 that <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus toxins were neutralized {{in the bloodstream}} of animals by substances they called antitoxins, which were specific for the respective toxin.

50|$|To {{accurately}} identify C. <b>diphtheriae,</b> a Gram stain {{is performed}} to show Gram-positive, highly pleomorphic organisms with no particular arrangement. Special stains like Alberts's stain and Ponder's stain {{are used to}} demonstrate the metachromatic granules formed in the polar regions. The granules are called as polar granules, Babes Ernst granules, volutin, etc. An enrichment medium, such as Löffler's medium, is used to preferentially grow C. <b>diphtheriae.</b> After that, a differential plate known as tellurite agar, allows all Corynebacteria (including C. <b>diphtheriae)</b> to reduce tellurite to metallic tellurium. The tellurite reduction is colorimetrically indicated by brown colonies for most Cornyebacteria species or by a black halo around the C. <b>diphtheriae</b> colonies.|$|R
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of clinically important Corynebacterium <b>diphtheriae</b> into specific biovars {{is complex and}} phylogenetically unclear. Comparative genomic analyses of 17 strains indicate that the division of C. <b>diphtheriae</b> into different biovars does not correlate with the variation in the gene content in the relevant metabolic categories that are potentially involved in the biovar discrimination. The biochemical separation is also not supported by phylogenetic analyses, suggesting molecular methods of typing C. <b>diphtheriae</b> strains should be adopted much more widely...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{problems with}} multidrug resistance {{in relation to}} Corynebacterium, including C. <b>diphtheriae,</b> are examples of challenges confronting many countries. For this reason, Brazilian C. <b>diphtheriae</b> strains were evaluated by the E-Test for their susceptibility to nine antibacterial drugs used in therapy. Resistance (MIC < 0. 002; 0. 38 µg/ml) to penicillin G was found in 14. 8 % of the strains tested. Although erythromycin (MIC 90 0. 75 µg/ml) and azithromycin (MIC 90 0. 064 µg/ml) were active against C. <b>diphtheriae</b> in this study, 4. 2 % of the strains showed decreased susceptibility (MIC 1. 0 µg/ml) to erythromycin. Multiple resistance profiles were determined by the disk diffusion method using 31 antibiotics. Most C. <b>diphtheriae</b> strains (95. 74 %) showed resistance to mupirocin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, and/or oxacillin, ampicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, clindamycin, lincomycin, and erythromycin.
