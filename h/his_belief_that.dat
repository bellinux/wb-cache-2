5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu {{in the running}} of the country, Nhu's attempt to run a police state through his secret Cần Lao apparatus and the lack of success against the Việt Cộng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E
5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> he could succeed as a novelist. For a time {{he turned his attention}} away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence he was able to complete his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> {{it provided}} an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As {{he developed the}} scheme for La Comédie humaine, he placed Louis Lambert in the Études philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E
5000|$|The final track, [...] "21st Century Safety Dance", was {{described}} by Ivan in the press release for the album as a [...] "warning" [...] track, explaining <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> all music would sound like it unless people [...] "got their act together".|$|R
50|$|Gaillot {{has been}} so active in <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> {{he has had to}} be stopped by the Vatican on {{numerous}} occasions, including one time when he was given a direct order by Pope John Paul II to avoid a conference in Italy about homosexuality.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2007, Alexander Lebedev filed claims with the prosecutor of Moscow in regards to <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the government was making inefficient choices on budget matters {{in regards to the}} monorail. A deputy later published a large section of the complaint in a newspaper.|$|R
5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> such a device would only make batting more difficult.|$|E
5|$|For Piłsudski {{this was}} a major shock, shaking <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Poland could {{function}} as a democracy and making him favor government by a strong hand. He became Chief of the General Staff and, together with Minister of Military Affairs Władysław Sikorski, managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5000|$|Firmin's work, first {{published}} in 1885, argued the opposite, that [...] "all men are endowed with the same qualities and the same faults, without distinction of color or anatomical form. The races are equal" [...] (pp. 450). He was marginalized at the time for <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> all human races were equal.|$|R
5000|$|... de Benneville socialized {{and traded}} herbal {{preparations}} with Native American {{groups in the}} area. <b>His</b> <b>beliefs</b> stressed <b>that</b> all people everywhere are loved by God, and cultures, races, and sexes have no bearing on the worth of a human being. <b>His</b> <b>beliefs</b> stated clearly <b>that</b> the physical body is merely {{one part of a}} person.|$|R

5|$|He {{also told}} reporters that {{he was certain that}} Conley was the actual murderer. Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed. One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the conatus ad motum, (conatus to motion), is not mental, but material.|$|E
5|$|An Auschwitz {{survivor}} {{with the}} mutant {{ability to generate}} powerful magnetic fields and manipulate metal, who was once friends with Xavier (with whom he helped to build Cerebro) until <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> humans and mutants could never co-exist led to their separation, leaving him to develop a sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation, which he uses {{in an attempt to}} mutate the world leaders in order to allow mutant prosperity.|$|E

50|$|At the 1945 general election, Scott-Elliot {{was elected}} as Labour Party Member of Parliament for Accrington. His {{background}} {{made him an}} unlikely recruit for the Labour Party, although he was perfectly sincere in <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> socialist planning was best for business. His connection with the cotton trade helped him make friends among the weavers in the constituency.|$|R
50|$|Al-‘Izz {{was also}} {{allegedly}} imprisoned for {{another one of}} <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> was viewed as egregious and reprehensible, which was {{the notion that the}} Prophet Muhammad was not the very best of all of God’s creations, as this belief went against the consensus of all the Muslim scholars, which is an incontrovertible source of Islamic law.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that,</b> {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> all bishops were equal.|$|E
5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious {{a few hundred yards}} away.|$|E
5000|$|In his Facebook page, he also posted <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> Canada was [...] "too soft" [...] {{to survive}} an {{impending}} attack, once writing {{in response to}} the 86th Academy Awards: The third world war could be right around the corner, wishful thinking isn't gonna stop this one. This will not be like Iraq, NATO is vastly outnumbered by Russia and her allies.|$|R
50|$|Of other issues, Cronin told Baird of {{his need}} for {{prostitution}} and alcohol. Baird noted Cronin grew distressed only when discussing the 1992 attack or past abuse. Cronin also discussed with Baird <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> he was reincarnated, that he'd been a soldier with the Charge of the Light Brigade. He also believed himself to be Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, {{as well as other}} persons in history.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} conflict between religious orthodoxy and astronomy occurred with the Greek astronomer Anaxagoras. <b>His</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the heavenly bodies {{were the result}} of an evolutionary process and that the sun was a great burning stone (rather than the deity Helios), resulted in his arrest. He was charged with contravening the established religious beliefs. Although acquitted, he was forced to go into retirement.|$|R
5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. <b>His</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed {{that he did not}} wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
5000|$|Whipple {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> all men were created equal, and is quoted as writing [...] "A {{recommendation}} is gone thither for raising some regiments of Blacks. This, I suppose will lay a foundation for the emancipation of those wretches in that country. I {{hope it will be}} the means of dispensing the blessings of Freedom to all the human race in America.".|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Yourdon {{became the center}} of {{controversy}} over <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> Y2K-related computer problems could result in severe software failures that would culminate in widespread social collapse. Due to the efforts of Yourdon and thousands of dedicated technologists, developers and project managers, these potential critical system failure points were successfully remediated, thus avoiding the problems Yourdon and others identified early enough to make a difference.|$|R
