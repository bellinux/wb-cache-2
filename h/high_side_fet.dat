50|$|Charge {{pumps are}} often used in H-Bridges in high side drivers for gate driving the high side {{n-channel}} power MOSFETs and IGBTs. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a half bridge goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} <b>high</b> <b>side</b> <b>FET</b> gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|E

50|$|The most {{efficient}} MOSFET designs use N-channel MOSFETs {{on both the}} <b>high</b> <b>side</b> and low side because they typically have {{a third of the}} ON resistance of P-channel MOSFETs. This requires a more complex design since the gates of the <b>high</b> <b>side</b> MOSFETs must be driven positive with respect to the DC supply rail. Many integrated circuit MOSFET gate drivers include a charge pump within the device to achieve this.|$|R

40|$|Line drop compensation, <b>high</b> <b>side</b> voltage control, {{secondary}} voltage control — why not control {{a generator like}} a static var compensator? Abstract: Generators typically regulate terminal voltage via automatic voltage regulator and exciter equipment. The desired <b>high</b> <b>side</b> (transmission side) voltage schedule is usually maintained by the power plant operator or by slow SCADA-type process control computers. Power system dynamic performance, however, can be improved by faster regulation of the transmission voltage. Contrasted to generators, static var compensators are designed specifically for transmission voltage regulation. The transmission voltage is directly regulated at high speed. Total SVC and medium voltage component reactive power ratings are referred to the transmission side. All medium voltage equipment are designed to support the transmission side reactive power and voltage regulation requirements. The droop (slope) setting is usually small compared to generators regulating terminal voltage. This paper introduces the panel session on {{secondary voltage}} control. I outline various methods for tighter <b>high</b> <b>side</b> voltage control, with emphasis on control of hydro generation in the U. S. Pacific Northwest...|$|R
