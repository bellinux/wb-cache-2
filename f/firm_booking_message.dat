We walked into a friend’s fundraising event in 2008 with four musical pastiches we’d thrown together in idle silliness. We walked out with a <b>firm</b> <b>booking</b> for an hour-long show. So, to make it appear intentional and ingenious, we jotted down all our scraps of song parodies - everything from 10-minute medleys to tiny fragments, simple swaps (Noël Coward and Lily Allen) to surreal associations (Kate Bush and Kate Nash), not to mention a completely ludicrous version of Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller' as a Highland fling. Then we reverse-engineered some sort of coherent act into existence." ...|$|R

It was called the Rockwell-O'Keefe Theatrical Agency. Their clients, then, included Bing Crosby and the newly formed Dorsey Brothers band. In 1939, when O'Keefe retired, Rockwell reorganized the firm and changed the name to General Amusement Corporation. In the 1940s, the only larger <b>booking</b> <b>firm</b> was Music Corporation of America (MCA).|$|R

50|$|Airline {{reservation}} systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger {{reservations and}} ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works {{within their own}} reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications {{to make their own}} reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A EDIFACT format for real time interactive communication and Type B TTY for informational and <b>booking</b> type of <b>messages.</b> Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.|$|R
40|$|We study two {{reservation}} deposit {{policies for}} a service firm {{to increase its}} revenue through higher capacity utilization. First, under the "no deposit" policy, the firm requires no reservation deposit and imposes no "no show" penalty. Anticipating potential "no shows," a firm may overbook; hence, {{there is no guarantee}} that the reserved service will be provided under the no deposit policy. On the contrary, under the "guarantee deposit" policy, a guarantee deposit is required for each customer to make a non-cancelable reservation. To honor the reserved service under the guarantee deposit policy, the firm will not overbook. We analyze each deposit policy as a Stackelberg game in which the firm acts as the leader who selects the booking capacity under the no deposit policy (or the required deposit under the guarantee deposit policy), and each customer acts as the follower who decides whether to reserve or not. Our model incorporates rational customer behavior so that each customer will take other customers' behavior into consideration. Using the <b>firm's</b> optimal <b>booking</b> capacity (optimal required deposit) in equilibrium under the no deposit policy (the guarantee deposit policy), we compare the firm's expected profits under these two policies in a monopolistic environment. Our results suggest that the firm should charge a higher optimal retail price under the no deposit policy, and adopt the no deposit policy when the demand rate is below a certain threshold. By analyzing a game of duopolistic competition between two firms, we develop the conditions under which the firms will adopt a particular pair of deposit policies in equilibrium, and we show this game can lead to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, when both firms charge the same retail price, we show the existence of an equilibrium in which both firms adopt the no deposit policy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInformation risk – the {{uncertainty}} regarding {{the parameters of}} the distribution of firms’ future cash flows – generates valuation errors and is costly to investors who require a higher return to compensate for greater information risk. We argue that, on average, through their impairment-testing disclosures, managers convey information that reduces information risk. Using disclosures from firms included in the SBF 250 index of Euronext Paris over the period 2006 – 2009, we document a negative association between impairment-testing disclosures and implied cost of equity capital. We find that prospective entity-specific impairment-testing disclosures are negatively associated with cost of capital whereas descriptive disclosures exhibit no association with cost of capital. Additionally, we document that <b>firms</b> which avoid <b>booking</b> impairments when low performance indicators suggest a greater likelihood of impairments exhibit no association between impairment-testing disclosures and cost of capital. This suggests that those firms’ disclosures are perceived as less accurate by investors. We also find that prospective impairment-testing disclosures are negatively related to analysts’ forecast errors. Our study adds to the literature on the economic consequences of financial reporting and sheds light on the consequences of one accounting mechanism, namely impairment-testing disclosures, ensuring conservatism of financial reporting...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{economic and}} strategic incen-tives of service providers {{to engage in}} advance booking while allowing for a full-refund for those customers who cancel or do not {{show up at the}} time when the good or the service is provided. We find that: • a fully refundable booking strategy is more profitable than a non-refundable booking strat-egy for small marginal costs, • a dual price booking strategy which separates the customers with respect to their showing up probability, improves social welfare and in-dustry profits. Ringbom and Shy 2003.

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} a {{simulation}} tool {{to make a}} decision of monthly production planning for maximizing a profit of Specialty store retailer of Private label Apparel (SPA) firms. Most of SPA firms are fabless and make outsourcing deals for productions with factories of their subcontractors. Every month, SPA <b>firms</b> make a <b>booking</b> for production lines and manpower in the factories. The booking is conducted a few months in advance based on a demand prediction and a monthly production planning at that time. However, the demand prediction is updated month by month, and the monthly production planning would change to meet the latest demand prediction. Then, SPA firms have to change the capacities initially booked within a certain range to suit to the monthly production planning. The booking system is called “capacity-booking”. These days, though it is an issue for SPA firms to make precise monthly production planning, many firms are still conducting the production planning by empirical rules. In addition, it is also a challenge for SPA firms to match their products and factories with considering their demand predictabilities and regulation abilities. In this paper, we suggest a model for considering these two issues. An objective is to maximize a total profit of certain periods, which is sales minus costs of production, inventory, and capacity-booking penalty. To make a better monthly production planning at SPA firms, these points should be considered: demand predictabilities by random trends, previous and next month’s production planning of the target month, and regulation abilities of the capacity-booking. To decide matching products and factories for outsourcing, {{it is important to consider}} seasonality, volume, and predictability of each product, production possibility, size, and regulation ability of each factory. SPA firms have to consider these constructions and decide orders with several factories per one product. We modeled these issues as a linear programming. To validate the model, an example of several computational experiments with a SPA firm is presented. We suppose four typical product groups: basic, seasonal (Spring / Summer), seasonal (Fall / Winter), and spot product. As a result of the experiments, a monthly production planning was provided. In the planning, demand predictabilities from random trend are reduced by producing products which are different product types. Moreover, priorities to produce are given to high-margin products. In conclusion, we developed a simulation tool {{to make a decision}} of monthly production planning which is useful when the production planning is set every month. We considered the features of capacity-booking, and matching of products and factories which have different features and conditions...|$|R
