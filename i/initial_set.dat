40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology for the determination of injection molding processing parameters for defect-free parts. The proposed methodology consists of two parts: <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> and defect correction. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme uses a simplified approach to estimate the processing window within the operating region of the process. The processing window is estimated by using a set of quality criteria in conjunction with a simplified process model. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> of the processing parameters is selected within the simplified processing window based on the minimum cycle time criterion. The defect correction scheme uses a qualitative approach to provide corrective actions if defects are existed after <b>initial</b> <b>setting.</b> A defect-free quality criteria is developed for this purpose. The corrective actions are guided by a qualitative search algorithm in conjunction with a knowledge base for defect correction. Results are presented to verify the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme and the defect correction scheme against numerical results of a commercial numerical simulation package C-MOLD. Results show that the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme is able to provide a reasonable initial estimate of the processing parameters, while the defect correction scheme is able to search the processing parameters to correct the violated quality criteria. The proposed methodology is further verified experimentally for a film-gated plate with two polymers, polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP). Experimental results for PS show that the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> scheme generates a set of defect-free processing parameters. Results for PP shows that corrective actions are necessary after <b>initial</b> <b>setting,</b> and the defect correction scheme is able to correct the defects...|$|R

40|$|Background: Indonesia is a {{tropical}} country with temperature variation. A lot of dental clinics {{do not use}} air conditioner. The room temperature influences water temperature for mixing alginate impression materials. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the functional relationship of room temperature and <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginate impression materials. Methods: The New Kromopan® alginate (normal and fast sets) were used. The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time were tested at 23 (control), 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 degrees Celcius room temperatures (n = 5). The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time was tested based on ANSI/ADA Specification no. 18 (ISO 1563). The alginate powder was mixed with distilled water (23 / 50 ratio), put in the metal ring mould, and the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time was measured by test rod. Data were statistically analyzed by linear regression (α = 0. 05). result: The <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> times were 149. 60 ± 0. 55 (control) and 96. 40 ± 0. 89 (31 ° C) seconds for normal set, and 122. 00 ± 1. 00 (control) and 69. 60 ± 0. 55 (31 ° C) seconds for fast set. The coefficient of determination of room temperature to <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginate were R 2 = 0. 74 (normal set) and R 2 = 0. 88 (fast set). The regression equation for normal set was Y = 257. 6 – 5. 5 X (p < 0. 01) and fast set was Y = 237. 7 – 5. 6 X (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The room temperature gave high contribution and became a strength predictor for <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time of alginates. The share contribution to the setting time was 0. 74 % for normal set and 0. 88 % for fast set alginates. </span...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Effect {{of added}} α-tricalcium {{phosphate}} (α-TCP) and β-TCP was investigated {{to understand the}} setting reaction of apatite cement consisting of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA). Addition of TCP delayed the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> time because TCP {{was not involved in}} the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> reaction and resulted in the decreased initial mechanical strength. After the <b>initial</b> <b>setting</b> of the cement due to the conversion of TTCP and DCPA into apatite, α-TCP dissolved to supply calcium and phosphate ions and they were consumed for crystal growth of apatite. Therefore, mechanical strength of the apatite cement containing α-TCP was increased. In contrast, added β-TCP showed no reactivity in the cement and thus result in the decreased mechanical strength...|$|R
