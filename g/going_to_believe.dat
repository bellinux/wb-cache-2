500|$|The {{third season}} was {{initially}} planned to include three separate mysteries {{that would be}} introduced and resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying [...] "subtle" [...] motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have [...] "a theory on whodunit" [...] when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be [...] "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, [...] "nice characters" [...] like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, [...] "key players [...] really interesting stuff to do".|$|E

Since I'm neither one of those, people are completely concerned about me." [...] In subsequent interviews he expressed frustration over continued questions about his sexual orientation, telling People magazine in 2006, [...] "It doesn't matter what I say.

[...] However, while allowing that many Republican members of Congress are [...] "resentful {{of the way he}} and the White House conducted the losing campaign", the New York Times also stated that, [...] "White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping Mr. Rove on through the rest of his term." ...|$|E

The {{attitude}} and tactics of Drummond and Cauty's partnership matched {{that of the}} fictional cult whose name they had adopted. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as [...] "Situationist pranks" [...] or [...] "publicity stunts". However, according to Drummond, [...] "That's {{just the way it}} was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> us, but we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct."

50|$|Back {{at their}} cottage, Marion reads Henri's letter, and Pauline {{suggests}} that they cut short their vacation. Both have been disappointed in their love affairs. After they drive out of the gate, Marion turns off the car and says to Pauline that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Henri did not sleep with Louisette, because believing otherwise would be too painful. She hints that Pauline can still honestly believe that Sylvain too did not sleep with Louisette. Both girls agree to cling on to their own ideas of the truth, and they begin the drive back to Paris. The film closes with the same shot of the cottage gate it opened with.|$|R
