5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties.

5|$|After {{the ship}} was again torpedoed in August 1942, her 1.1-inch gun mounts were {{replaced}} by an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts while she was under repair at Pearl Harbor. Her light anti-aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time. In January 1944 a number of her 20mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns, {{many of which were}} in the positions formerly occupied by the ship's boats in the sides of the hull. Saratoga mounted 23 quadruple and two twin 40mm mountings as well as 16 Oerlikon guns when she completed her refit.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 June, Skanderbeg {{arranged}} his army for battle. Apart from the 3,000 warriors hidden behind the Ottoman army, Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3,000 {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards. They were divided into three groups, each composed of 3,000 men. They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into a downhill charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge. An <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen. The main body of infantry, commanded by Ajdin Muzaka, was placed behind the archers.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese erroneously {{announced}} that Maryland had been sunk, but on 30 December, the damaged ship entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind Tennessee. Two {{of the original}} twelve 5 in/51 cal guns were removed and the 5in/25 cal guns were replaced by an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 5 in/38 cal dual purpose guns. Over {{the course of the}} next two months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942. She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and the Christmas Islands. She was sent back into action in June 1942, the first ship damaged at Pearl Harbor to return to duty.|$|E

The country is also rich with Intangible culture and holds ten of UNESCO's World's intangible culture masterpieces, surpassing all countries in Europe except Spain which possesses an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the listed items.

5|$|The Royal Charter of 1841 was {{amended to}} include the University Council in 1874. The Council is a {{composite}} of the Board of Trustees, senators and an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> elected graduates.

Although it is not directly involved in operations, the Council may bring to the Senate or Board of Trustees any matter that it believes affects Queen's well-being. The Council meets once per year, typically in May.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E

The most recent recipients are Mike Trout in the American League and Kris Bryant in the National League.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the {{predominantly}} Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also {{complained that they}} were underrepresented by the Kingdom's system of government, where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5million people, while an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms.|$|E

He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting {{of the members of the}} Bundestag and an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> state delegates. The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.

5|$|After {{four years}} at tier two, Rosenborg joined the First Division in 1967 and won the league that season. Since, Rosenborg has only played the 1978 season at the second tier. The First Division was renamed the Norwegian Premier League in 1991. The club entered the cup {{for the first time}} in 1932, {{claiming}} its first title in 1960. Rosenborg has experienced two golden eras; the first in the 1960s and early 1970s resulted in three league and three cup honors, in addition to an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> runner-up positions in both tournaments. The second golden era started with winning the league in 1985 and has resulted in nineteen league and six cup titles. Fourteen league titles were claimed under manager Nils Arne Eggen and sixteen have been won by midfielder Roar Strand.|$|E
5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009. After Georges Leekens' second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.|$|E
50|$|This {{does not}} mean that {{individual}} positive and negative charges cannot be created or destroyed. Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles such as electrons and protons, which can be created and destroyed. In particle physics, charge conservation means that in elementary particle reactions that create charged particles, <b>equal</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> positive and negative particles are always created, keeping the net amount of charge unchanged. Similarly, when particles are destroyed, <b>equal</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> positive and negative charges are destroyed.|$|R
