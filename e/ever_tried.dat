A caller questioned whether Hayes was under the influence of a substance, and Carolla and co-host Teresa Strasser asked Hayes if he had ever used marijuana. After some confusion on what was being asked, Hayes replied that he had only <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> it once. During the interview the radio hosts made light of Hayes's awkward answers, and replayed Hayes comments as sound drops—often simulating conversation with his co-hosts. Hayes stated during this interview that he was no longer on good terms with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.|$|E
25|$|Game 5 {{began with}} the unconventional, soulful singing of the {{national}} anthem by José Feliciano, drawing boos from some Detroit fans. When the game got underway, the Cardinals immediately scored three runs {{in the first inning}} off Mickey Lolich. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock doubled, and the Cardinals had a chance to break the game open, but Brock tried to score from second base on a single to left field. Brock was out in a collision with Bill Freehan at home plate, as Willie Horton's throw hit Bill Freehan's glove on the fly, and Brock elected not to slide. Brock later remarked that he never slid because no one had <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> to throw him out at home. In the 7th inning, the Cardinals led, 3–2. Mickey Lolich led off for the Tigers in the 7th inning with a bloop single, and the Tigers loaded the bases for Al Kaline to slap a single into right field, driving in two runs. Cash drove in another run, and the Tigers led, 5–3, which proved to be the final score. Mickey Lolich pitched his second complete game victory.|$|E

[...] Wong's character in Shanghai Express was the subject of John Yau's 1989 poem [...] "No One <b>Ever</b> <b>Tried</b> to Kiss Anna May Wong", which interprets the actress' career as a series of tragic romances. In David Cronenberg's 1993 film version of David Henry Hwang's 1986 play, M. Butterfly, Wong's image was used briefly as a symbol of a [...] "tragic diva".

500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have <b>ever</b> <b>tried.</b> With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that." ...|$|E
500|$|The defence called Brownlee, who recounted {{his version}} of events. [...] He testified {{that he had been}} {{otherwise}} occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in Stettler at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton. [...] In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of Raymond. [...] MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in Calgary, only to have Brownlee retort that he had only <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> two cases, spending most of his time drafting commercial documents. [...] MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an [...] "Edmonton lawyer"—taken by all involved to be MacLean—had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate. [...] He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics.

[...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as we do here, and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest this season has to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, as I love watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest.

People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half out of five stars saying that its {{construction}} is [...] "as perfect as it could be." [...] It doesn't [...] "deviate" [...] from Dion's mainstream audience, yet it [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance, while [...] "keeping hip" [...] ("Nature Boy"). Although Erlewine described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as [...] "bizarre", he wrote that [...] "there's really nothing to fault it on, actually," [...] the album is [...] "more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it's a balancing act that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off." [...] According to Erlewine, the songs aren't [...] "that particularly memorable", [...] "the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place," [...] but it [...] "never catches hold, either." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave A New Day Has Come three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and [...] "if she <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> anything too edgy she'd probably just sound foolish." [...] Cinquemani disliked [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] but praised [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] on which Dion [...] "gets the Cher treatment", an unexpected [...] "change of pace that actually works." [...] Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a [...] "soulful" [...] rendition of [...] "At Last" [...] and a [...] "simple and moving" [...] arrangement of [...] "Nature Boy". He also noticed that the album is [...] "packed" [...] with the usual adult contemporary songs: [...] "I Surrender", a power ballad [...] "only a singer with Dion's voice could pull off," [...] "Ten Days", the guitar-driven [...] "catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal," [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that [...] "will leave you nauseous or in tears", [...] "I'm Alive", the [...] "uplifting" [...] midtempo number and [...] "A New Day Has Come", the [...] "stirring" [...] title track.|$|E
