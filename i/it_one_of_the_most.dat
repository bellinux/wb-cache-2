5|$|Red maple's rapid growth, ease of transplanting, {{attractive}} form, {{and value}} for wildlife (in the eastern US) has made <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> extensively planted trees.

Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.|$|E
