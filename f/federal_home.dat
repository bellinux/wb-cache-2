5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the Federal Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Bank Board.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{testified against}} Keating {{in a civil}} suit brought by Lincoln bondholders, and {{was seen as the}} plaintiffs' best witness. The other four {{senators}} refused to testify. Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until their terms expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and not running for re-election in 1998.|$|E

Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, {{though they had}} more refined decorations to look like New World <b>homes.</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>homes</b> had {{features}} such as narrow sidelights with an embracing fanlight around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls.

25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E
25|$|Homeownership {{has been}} {{promoted}} as government policy using several means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Banks, which fund or guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets {{with the purpose of}} directly or indirectly promoting homeownership. Homeownership has been further promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for mortgage interest payments on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E

Another Housing Act was later passed in 1944 {{with the intention of}} providing federally guaranteed loans or mortgages to individuals who wished to repair or construct dwellings through their own initiative. The Vocational Training Co-ordination Act of 1942 provided an impetus to the provinces to set up facilities for postsecondary vocational training, and in 1948 the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act was passed, which safeguarded the rights of workers to join unions while requiring employers to recognize unions chosen by their employees.|$|E
25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
