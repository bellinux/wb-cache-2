5|$|While {{preparing}} {{for his role}} as a deaf man in See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil, Wilder met Karen Webb (née Boyer), who was a clinical supervisor for the New York League for the Hard of Hearing. Webb coached him in lip reading. Following Gilda Radner's death, Wilder and Webb reconnected, and on September 8, 1991, they married. The two lived in Stamford, Connecticut, in the 1734 Colonial home that he had shared with Radner.|$|E
5|$|Wilder {{began his}} career on stage, and made his screen debut in an episode of the TV series The Play of the Week in 1961. Although his first film role was portraying a hostage in the 1967 motion picture Bonnie and Clyde, Wilder's first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1968 film The Producers {{for which he was}} {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This was {{the first in a series}} of collaborations with writer/director Mel Brooks, including 1974's Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which Wilder co-wrote, garnering the pair an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Wilder is known for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) and for his four films with Richard Pryor: Silver Streak (1976), Stir Crazy (1980), See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil (1989), and Another You (1991). Wilder directed and wrote several of his own films, including The Woman in Red (1984).|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Pryor {{signed a}} five-year {{contract}} with Columbia Pictures for US$40million and he started his own production company, Indigo Productions. Softer, more formulaic films followed, including Superman III (1983), which earned Pryor $4million; Brewster's Millions (1985), Moving (1988), and See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil (1989). The only film project from this period that recalled his rough roots was Pryor's semiautobiographic debut as a writer-director, Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling (1986), which was not a major success.|$|E

500|$|TriStar Pictures {{wanted to}} produce another film {{starring}} Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder {{agreed to do}} See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil only if he were allowed to rewrite the script. The studio agreed, and See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil premiered on May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder and Pryor, as well as Kevin Spacey's performance, but they mostly agreed that the script was terrible. Roger Ebert called it [...] "a real dud"; the Deseret Morning News described the film as [...] "stupid", with an [...] "idiotic script" [...] that had a [...] "contrived story" [...] and too many [...] "juvenile gags", while Vincent Canby called it [...] "by far the most successful co-starring vehicle for Mr. Pryor and Mr. Wilder", also acknowledging that [...] "this is not elegant movie making, {{and not all of}} the gags are equally clever".|$|E

By mid-November, however, he told the Associated Press that he was [...] "leaning to staying, but nothing's firm." [...] Mitchell instead chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NFL Draft in early January 2001. He stated, [...] "I have had a great time, but it's {{time for me to}} give {{something}} back to my family." [...] Mitchell said he would be quieter in the NFL: [...] "You won't <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> more trash talking from Freddie Mitchell, those are the big boys, I'm just a little kid again. I'm humble." [...] He had 119 catches for 2,135yards and 10 touchdowns in his career as a Bruin.|$|E
500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, <b>Hear</b> <b>No,</b> See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. <b>Hear</b> <b>No,</b> See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too hard. I felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E

500|$|Coulter's second studio album Brand New Day was {{released}} in August2007, which peaked at number37 and was certified gold. The album was preceded by the lead single [...] "Can't Touch It", which peaked at numbertwo on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum. It also produced two other top-ten singles, [...] "Love Is All Around" [...] and [...] "Can't Sing a Different Song". Coulter's first compilation album Ricki-Lee: The Singles {{was released}} in November2008, but failed to impact the charts. Its lead single [...] "Wiggle It" [...] peaked at number11. Coulter was expected to release her third studio album <b>Hear</b> <b>No,</b> See No, Speak No in November2009, but she decided to cancel the album's release due to its first two singles struggling on the charts.

500|$|The date {{set for the}} executions of {{the three}} Quaker evangelists, William Robinson, Marmaduke Stephenson and Mary Dyer, was 27 October 1659. [...] Captain James Oliver of the Boston {{military}} company was directed to provide a force of armed soldiers to escort the prisoners {{to the place of}} execution. [...] Dyer walked hand-in-hand with the two men, and between them. [...] When she was publicly asked about this inappropriate closeness, she responded instead to her sense of the event: [...] "It is an hour of the greatest joy I can enjoy in this world. [...] No eye can see, no ear can <b>hear,</b> <b>no</b> tongue can speak, no heart can understand the sweet incomes and refreshings of the spirit of the Lord which now I enjoy." [...] The prisoners attempted to speak to the gathered crowd as they proceeded to the gallows, but their voices were drowned out by constant drum beats.|$|E
500|$|Rock Steady {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 15 reviews. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield wrote it was [...] "impressive to <b>hear</b> <b>No</b> Doubt summon the musical imagination {{to transcend the}} formula that used to imprison them". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to the album as [...] "a good, hooky, stylish mainstream pop record". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly remarked that there was [...] "something oddly flimsy" [...] about No Doubt that prevented it from becoming a milestone in pop music, but that the band's [...] "party-throwing skills improve with each new gathering." [...] Colleen of Delaney of Stylus Magazine commented that the band sounded like it had [...] "growing pains" [...] and was unsure of its place in mainstream rock, predicting that No Doubt would either become a singles band [...] "or go all Radiohead on us and make an album of avant-jazz-electro-acid-funk-polka." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilder met Saturday Night Live actress Gilda Radner on August 13, 1981, while filming Sidney Poitier's Hanky Panky. Radner {{was married}} to guitarist G. E. Smith at the time, but [...] Wilder and she became inseparable friends. When the filming of Hanky Panky ended, Wilder found himself missing Radner, so he called her. The {{relationship}} grew, and Radner eventually divorced Smith in 1982. She moved in with Wilder, and the couple married on September 14, 1984, {{in the south of}} France. The couple wanted to have children, but Radner suffered miscarriages, and doctors could not determine the problem. After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from pain in her upper legs on the set of Haunted Honeymoon, Radner sought medical treatment. Following a number of false diagnoses, she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986. Over the next year and a half, Radner battled the disease, receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. The disease finally went into remission, giving the couple a respite, during which time Wilder filmed See No Evil, <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil. By May 1989, the cancer returned and had metastasized. Radner died on May 20, 1989. Wilder later stated, [...] "I always thought she'd pull through." ...|$|E
500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{few years}} prior to his death, Falk had {{expressed}} interest in returning to the role. In 2007 he claimed he had chosen a script for one last Columbo episode, [...] "Columbo: <b>Hear</b> <b>No</b> Evil". The script was renamed [...] "Columbo's Last Case". ABC declined the project. In response, producers for the series announced that they were attempting to shop the project to foreign production companies. However, Falk was diagnosed with dementia in late 2007. During a 2009 court trial over Falk's care, Dr Stephen Read stated that the actor's condition had deteriorated so badly that Falk could no longer remember playing a character named Columbo, nor could he identify who Columbo was. Falk died on June 23, 2011, aged 83.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the vicissitudes}} of the congregation's history, the {{archives}} of Pohick Church are not extensive. Nevertheless, they do contain a handful of notable books and documents. Chief among these is the original vestry book of Truro Parish, which documents every vestry from 1732 until the organization was disbanded on January 23, 1785. The book was then used by the Overseers of the Poor, legal successors to the vestry, until 1802. The book was lost for 75 years – William Meade writes that he [...] "can <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> tidings" [...] of it in Old Churches and Families in Virginia, published in 1857 – but was eventually repurchased by the church for $20. It was held for a time at Mount Vernon, and was later deposited with the Library of Congress, with copies left with the church office for record-keeping. The vestry book has been digitized, and is available online for perusal.|$|E
2500|$|Caesar {{reports that}} he burnt every village and {{building}} that he could find in {{the territory of the}} Eburones, drove off all the cattle, and his men and beasts consumed all the corn that the weather of the autumnal season did not destroy. He left those who had hid themselves, if there were any, with the hope that they would all die of hunger in the winter. Caesar says that he wanted to annihilate the Eburones and their name, and indeed we <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> more of the Eburones. Their country was soon occupied by a Germanic tribe with a different name, the Tungri. However, as discussed further below, the report of Tacitus that the Tungri were the original [...] "Germani" [...] that came earliest over the Rhine, and the way this matches the description by Caesar of the Eburones and their neighbours, leads to the possibility that they survived under a new name.|$|E

2500|$|The prophetic {{assignment}} {{is not always}} portrayed as positive in the Hebrew Bible, and prophets were often the target of persecution and opposition. God’s personal prediction for Jeremiah, [...] "Attack you they will, overcome you they can't," [...] was performed {{many times in the}} biblical narrative as Jeremiah warned of destruction of those who continued to refuse repentance and accept more moderate consequences. In return for his adherence to God’s discipline and speaking God’s words, Jeremiah was attacked by his own brothers, beaten and put into the stocks by a priest and false prophet, imprisoned by the king, threatened with death, thrown into a cistern by Judah’s officials, and opposed by a false prophet. Likewise, Isaiah was told by his hearers who rejected his message, [...] "Leave the way! Get off the path! Let us <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> more about the Holy One of Israel!"

In the Epitome of pseudo-Apollodorus, a genealogy is given for Chrysaor ("of the golden sword") that would make him a double of Bellerophon; he too is called the son of Glaucus the son of Sisyphus. Chrysaor has no myth save that of his birth: from the severed neck of Medusa, who was with child by Poseidon, he and Pegasus both sprang at the moment of her death. [...] "From this moment we <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> more of Chrysaor, the rest of the tale concerning the stallion only... perhaps also for his brother's sake, by whom in the end he let himself be caught, the immortal horse by his mortal brother." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Wilson's rewrite {{kept the}} basic {{structure}} of Serling's screenplay but rewrote all the dialogue and set the script in a more primitive society. According to associate producer Mort Abrahams an additional uncredited writer (his only recollection was that the writer's last name was Kelly) polished the script, rewrote some of the dialogue and included some of the more heavy-handed tongue-in-cheek dialogue ("I never met an ape I didn't like") which wasn't in either Serling or Wilson's drafts. According to Abraham some scenes, such as the one where the judges imitate the [...] "See no evil, speak no evil and <b>hear</b> <b>no</b> evil" [...] monkeys, were improvised on the set by director Franklin J. Schaffner and kept in the final film because of the audience reaction during test screenings prior to release. During filming John Chambers, who designed prosthetic make up in the film, held training sessions at 20th Century-Fox studios, where he mentored other make-up artists of the film.|$|E
