They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>mood,</b> is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>mood</b> of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E

500|$|At the Conference of State Metternich {{lost his}} {{principal}} ally Karel Clam-Martinic in 1840, which furthered the growing paralysis {{at the heart}} of Austrian government. Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. Fortunately there were no major challenges to the regime from outside. Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>mood,</b> he was an awkward guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence from Kraków. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an action of dubious utility: not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the [...] "Metternich system" [...] that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich's resignation were ignored. For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together.|$|E

Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it.

5000|$|Active mood {{is another}} factor that affects music preference. Generally whether people are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good or <b>bad</b> <b>mood</b> when they hear music affects {{how they feel about}} the type of music and also their {{emotional}} response. On that line of thinking, aggression has been shown to improve creativity and emotional intensity derived from music. People with aggressive disorders find music to be a powerful emotional outlet. [...] Additionally, the value people put on music and frequency of listening affects their reactions to it. If people listen to a certain type of music and add emotional experience to songs or <b>a</b> genre <b>in</b> general, this increases the likelihood of enjoying the music and being emotionally affected by it.

30|$|The {{role of the}} {{stepping}} stone model might be overrated <b>in</b> Panels <b>A</b> to C for several reasons. First, if mobility costs are existent and positive, workers will only accept a new job if it yields a strictly higher utility than the current job 24. As a result, variance resulting from workers accepting a new job of the same quality as the previous job {{will no longer be}} attributed to the {{stepping stone}} model but to the learning model. Though for unsatisfied workers this will happen rarely (up to 6 percent of the cases), satisfied workers {{are much more likely to}} accept a new job with similar job satisfaction rating (about 50 percent of the cases). As a result, the shares presented <b>in</b> Panels <b>A</b> to C should be considered as an upper bound. Alternatively, the importance of the stepping stone model might be misstated if workers have not completely learned the true job quality during the first year in the job, because Panels A to C relate job satisfaction in the old job to job satisfaction reported in the first year of the new job. Therefore, in Panel D, I use job satisfaction reported in the final year of the new job when learning is expected to be completed 25. Note that the share of variance attributed to the stepping stone model is similar. Alternatively, the importance of learning could be overstated if individuals answer differently to job satisfaction questions in different waves (which could occur for example if they happen to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>mood</b> when filling in the questionnaire). Finally, in Panel E I look at job satisfaction while conditioning on wages and hours worked. After running a job satisfaction estimation (similar to the one presented in Table  3), one can predict what job satisfaction in the new job would have been if the real hourly wage and the number of working would have been the same as in the old job. Since wages and working hours are usually job characteristics that are observable ex-ante, it is not surprising that the role of the stepping stone theory is smaller once you condition on having no change in these job characteristics. Nevertheless, the results are not very different from the results <b>in</b> Panel <b>A.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 1 November 1915 Townshend led the 6th (Poona) Division from Kut-al-Amara {{and marched}} up {{the course of}} the River Tigris. Ctesiphon, some 25 mi south of Baghdad was reached on 20 November 1915. Here they met an Ottoman force of more than twenty {{thousand}} troops that had issued from Baghdad to oppose their approach to the city, giving them a numerical advantage of 2 to 1 over the 6th (Poona) Division, sited within well-prepared defensive trench fortifications. General Nurreddin Pasha had the command of four divisions, namely the 35th, the 38th, the 45th and 51st which he had dug in at trenches built over the ruins of Ctesiphon. At Ctesiphon, Townshend was obsessed with the Arch of Ctesiphon. Strachan stated:"The centre of the battlefield of Ctesiphon is the Arch, and it figures in all of the photographs of the Army when they reached this high point of the advance. And its immensely powerful for Townshend, the student of military history, because this marks the extremity of the Roman Empire, this marks the point where Belisarius, the famous Roman commander, had got to, coming in the other direction, of course. But for those with a classical education, as of course just about every British officer had received before the First World War, then this is a very powerful image indeed". Townshend had divided his division into four columns. To Column A, he assigned the Dorset regiment, the 104th Rifles and the Thirtieth Composite Brigade to which he attached two Gurkha companies. To Column B, Townshend assigned the Norfolk regiment, the 7th Rajputs and the 110th Mahrattas. To Column C went the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, the Twenty-second Punjabi regiment, the 103rd Mahrattas and 119th Infantry. And finally to Column D went the 7th Lancers, the Sixteenth Cavalry, the Thirty-third Cavalry and S battery of the Royal Horse Artillery. Townshend's plans called the Principle Mass [...] "either to throw the Turks into the Tigris or compel them to a disastrous flight across the Diala river, some six miles behind them". Column C was to attack Nureddin Pasha's right flank to distract him while the [...] "Principle Mass" [...] of Columns A and B were to attack the left flank of the Ottoman lines while Column D was to race around the Ottoman positions to attack from the rear.

5000|$|Kádár, as <b>in</b> 1946, was <b>a</b> Communist Party campaigner, and was {{described}} by historian Robert Gough as [...] "a great success". The Communist Party won <b>a</b> majority <b>in</b> parliament in 1947, {{and because of the}} escalation of the Cold War, the Soviet leadership ordered them to create a one-party state. Kádár played <b>an</b> active role <b>in</b> the creation of the Hungarian Working People's Party; created by a merger of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. At the unification congress Kádár made a speech which made little impact on the Communist movement in Hungary. In May 1948 Kádár visited the Soviet Union, and for the first and last time in his life he saw Joseph Stalin with his own eyes. During his visit to the USSR, Kádár's brother, Jenő died. On 5 August 1948 László Rajk was appointed {{to the office of the}} Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Kádár took his place as Minister of the Interior. As Interior Minister, he did not have real power as the most important organizations of internal state security operated under the direct control of Rákosi and his closest associates. In 1949, Borbála died, and Kádár married Mária Tamáska.Just as Stalin had launched a Great Purge against those with knowledge of the pre-Stalin party, Rákosi launched a purge against those who had worked in Hungary, and not in the Soviet Union, during World War II and before. In retrospect, it is clear that Kádár was appointed Minister of the Interior with the deliberate aim to involve him in the [...] "show trial" [...] of Laszlo Rajk, although the investigations and proceedings were handled by the State Security Agency with the active participation of the Soviet Secret Police. Rákosi later boasted of [...] "spending many a sleepless night" [...] in unraveling the threads of the [...] "anti-party conspiracy" [...] led by Rajk and his [...] "gang." [...] During the public trial, Rákosi personally gave instructions to the judge over the phone. Rákosi would later attempt to blame Kádár for Rajk's death. [...] Later in his life Rákosi said that Rajk died screaming [...] "Long live Stalin! Long live Rákosi!" [...] while Tibor Szönyi died without saying a word and András Szalai crying. Farkas and Gábor Péter, upon the death of Rajk and the others, said [...] "provocateurs to their last breaths". This event didn't assure Kádár; making him doubt if any of the accusation leveled against his co-workers were true. It is believed that after Rajk's death Kádár was seen vomiting; these rumours have not been confirmed by any sources from that time. Rákosi contacted him the following the day, asking him why he was <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>mood,</b> and continued, saying; [...] "Did the executions affect you that much?". According to certain rumours, which are probably not reliable, Kádár visited Rákosi to tell him about his reaction to the execution. Later, during a party presentation to a college, Kádár emphasised party austerity. This presentation might reflect on Kádár's reaction to Rajk's execution and his revelation that he might become the next victim of government repression.
