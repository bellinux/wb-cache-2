5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

[...] In the Court's biweekly conference sessions, traditionally a period for vote-counting, Frankfurter had the habit of lecturing his colleagues for forty-five minutes at a time or more with his book resting on a podium. Frankfurter's ideological opponents would leave the room or read their mail while he lectured.|$|E

2500|$|Sting {{lost the}} title to [...] "The Monster" [...] Abyss on November 19 at Genesis by {{disqualification}} after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into {{a stack of}} tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued {{as he tried to}} get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his satanic manager James Mitchell. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard Tomko were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at Turning Point, where Abyss retained the title. After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost chokeslamming him on an edition of Impact!, but ultimately convinced himself not to.|$|E

The Duke of Berry was there, and him they talked over as well as they could, and the numerous company was amused by the Grand Duchess, to the best of her ability. The effect of the wine in more ways than one was such that people were troubled, and, since she could not be sobered, it became necessary to carry her back, drunk as she was, to Versailles. All the servants waiting with the carriages saw the condition she was in, and did not keep it to themselves; nevertheless, they succeeded in concealing it from the King, from Monseigneur, and from Madame de Maintenon ...|$|E
