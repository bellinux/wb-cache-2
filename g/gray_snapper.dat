Currently, <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> in the Gulf are managed as a single stock; however, there are no data on the population structure of the species. Population structure of <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> in the Gulf was assessed via homogeneity testing of allele and genotype distributions at 13 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and a 590 base-pair fragment of mitochondrial DNA. No significant differences in allele or haplotype distributions of either microsatellite or mitochondrial DNA were found in samples from five localities in the Gulf and one locality from the western Atlantic. These data are consistent with a single-stock hypothesis for <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> in the Gulf. Levels of genetic variation were comparatively low and analysis of demographic history revealed a two to three order-of-magnitude decrease in effective population size occurring over the past 5, 000 years.

The recreational fishery for <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> has developed rapidly in south Louisiana {{with the advent of}} harvest and seasonal restrictions on the established red snapper (L. campechanus) fishery. We examined the age and growth of <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> in Louisiana with the use of cross-sectioned sagittae. A total of 833 specimens, (441 males, 387 females, and 5 of unknown sex) were opportunistically sampled from the recreational fishery from August 1998 to August 2002. Males ranged in size from 222 to 732 mm total length (TL) and from 280 g to 5700 g total weight (TW) and females ranged from 254 to 756 mm TL and from 340 g to 5800 g TW. Both edge analysis and bomb radiocarbon analyses were used to validate otolith-based age estimates. Ages were estimated for 718 individuals; both males and females ranged from 1 to 28 years. The von Bertalanffy growth models derived from TL at age were Lt = 655. 41 –e[– 0. 23 (t) ] for males, Lt = 657. 31 –e[– 0. 21 (t) ] for females, and L t = 656. 41 –e[– 0. 22 (t) ] for all specimens of known sex.

Data showed overlap for 13 C and 18 Oisotope measurements for the juvenile portion of sub-adult otoliths to isotope values for the middle and lower Florida Keys regions, thereby suggesting a migratory connection. Specific nursery habitats contributed approximately 93 % of individuals sampled for yellowtail and approximately 98 % for <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> to the Florida Keys coral reef tract.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the abundance of <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus griseus) in Texas bays and estuaries over the past 30 years is correlated to increased wintertime surface water temperatures. Trends in the relative abundance of <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> are evaluated by using monthly fishery-independent monitoring data {{from each of the}} seven major estuaries along the Texas coast from 1978 through 2006. Environmental conditions during this period demonstrated increasing annual sea surface temperatures, although this increase was not seasonally uniform. The largest proportion of temperature increases was attributed to higher winter temperature minimums since 1993. Positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, resulting in wetter, warmer winters in the eastern United States have occurred nearly uninterrupted since the late 1970 s, and unprecedented positive index values occurred between 1989 and 1995. Increases in water temperature in Texas estuaries, beginning in the early 1990 s, are postulated to provide both favorable over-wintering conditions for the newly settled juveniles and increased recruitment success. In the absence of cold winters, this species has established semipermanent estuarine populations across the entire Texas coast. A shift to negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation will likely result in returns to colder winter temperature minimums that could reverse any recent population gains...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to {{understand}} the spatial and temporal variation in spawning and settlement of <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus griseus) along the West Florida shelf (WFS). Juvenile <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> were collected over two consecutive years from seagrass meadows with a benthic scrape and otter trawl. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across three sampling regions (Panhandle, Big bend, and Southwest) by using otolith microstructure. Histology of adult gonads was also used for an independent estimate of spawning time. Daily growth increments were visible in the lapilli of snapper 11 – 150 mm standard length; ages ranged from 38 to 229 days and estimated average planktonic larval duration was 25 days. Estimated growth rates ranged from 0. 60 to 1. 02 mm/d and did not differ among the three sampling regions, but did differ across sampling years. Back-calculated fertilization dates from otoliths indicated that juveniles in the Panhandle and Big Bend were mainly summer spawned fish, whereas Southwest juveniles had winter and summer fertilization dates. Settlement occurred during summer both years and in the winter of 1997 for the southern portion of the WFS. Moon phase {{did not appear to be}} strongly correlated with fertilization or settlement.

The snapper had the shortest photoreceptor response latency time (26. 7 ms) and the highest CFFmax (47 Hz), suggesting that its eyes are adapted for a brighter photic environment. In contrast, the snook had the longest response latency time (36. 8 ms) and lowest CFFmax (40 Hz), indicating that its eyes are adapted for a dimmer environment or nocturnal lifestyle. Species spectral responses ranged from 360 to 620 nm and revealed the presence of rods sensitive to dim and twilight conditions, as well as multiple cone visual pigments providing the basis for color and contrast discrimination.

40|$|Abstract. —Newly {{recruited}} juvenile <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus griseus {{were collected}} each fall for two consecutive years (2000 and 2001) from sites in Florida and North Carolina. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across sites based on otolith microstructure. Larval otolith growth trajectories were generally similar for larvae from different sites and years; however, the mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 1 d longer for fish from North Carolina than for {{fish from the}} more southern sites. As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0. 62 and 0. 88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed {{to some of the}} observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of larval and juvenile growth coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites...|$|E
40|$|Distribution and {{survival}} of fish {{are influenced by}} benthic habitat and complexity. While many studies have investigated the effects of algal cover on fishes in reef habitats, comparatively less is known regarding this relationship in mangrove habitats. Possible links between substrate macro-algal cover and fish distribution were studied in a Caribbean mangrove lagoon via visual surveys and algal removal experiments. In addition, the effects of algae on relative predation were tested by calculating survival of tethered brachyuran prey, whose predators are known to include larger lutjanid (snapper) juveniles. Comparisons of algae and fish distributions show that percent cover of algae and juvenile lutjanid, Lutjanus griseus (<b>gray</b> <b>snapper)</b> abundances were significantly negatively correlated. Results from the algae removal experiment showed that algae had {{a negative effect on}} abundance of carnivorous fishes in two (out of three) locations in the lagoon. In addition, tethered prey had significantly higher proportional survival in plots with algae-present relative to plots with algae-absent. We present here experimental evidence that increased algal growth in mangroves may reduce predator encounter rates by prey. These observations are important, as the presence of carnivorous fishes is a key factor for the maintenance of high diversity in mangrove and on neighboring coral reefs. Furthermore, findings from this study imply that algal cover must be considered when protecting mangrove habitat. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Unbiased {{counts of}} {{individuals}} or species are often impossible given {{the prevalence of}} cryptic or mobile species. We used 77 simultaneous multi-gear deployments to make inferences about relative abundance, diversity, length composition, and habitat of the reef fish community along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. In total, 117 taxa were observed by underwater visual census (UVC), stationary video, and chevron fish traps, with more taxa being observed by UVC (100) than video (82) or traps (20). Frequency of occurrence of focal species was similar among all sampling approaches for tomtate Haemulon aurolineatum and black sea bass Centropristis striata, higher for UVC and video compared to traps for red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and higher for UVC compared to video or traps for <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> L. griseus and lionfish Pterois spp. For 6 of 7 focal species, correlations of relative abundance among gears were strongest between UVC and video, but there was substantial variability among species. The number of recorded species between UVC and video was correlated (ρ = 0. 59), but relationships between traps and the other 2 methods were weaker. Lengths of fish visually estimated by UVC were similar to lengths of fish caught in traps, as were habitat characterizations from UVC and video.

However, a major stock assessment of Hawaiian coral reef fish populations {{has not yet been}} conducted. Here we used the robust indicator variable "average length in the exploited phase of the population ([Formula: see text]) ", estimated from size composition data from commercial fisheries trip reports and fishery-independent diver surveys, to evaluate exploitation rates for 19 Hawaiian reef fishes.

We used the estimated exploitation rates coupled with life history parameters synthesized from the literature to parameterize a numerical population model and generate stock sustainability metrics such as spawning potential ratios (SPR). We found good agreement between predicted average lengths in an unfished population (from our population model) and those observed from diver surveys in the largely unexploited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Of 19 exploited reef fish species assessed in the main Hawaiian Islands, 9 had SPRs close to or below the 30 % overfishing threshold.

The accumulation of periphyton on glass periphytometers was four times higher in artificial reef plots (200. 1 ± 45. 8 mg chl-a m- 2) compared to control plots (54. 8 ± 6. 8 mg chl-a m- 2). The seagrass beds surrounding the artificial reefs changed rapidly, from a sparse Thalassia testudinum (Banks 2 ̆ 6 Soland. ex König) dominated community, which persisted at control plots, to a community dominated by Halodule wrightii (Ascherson). Such changes mirror the changes induced in experimentally fertilized seagrass beds in Florida, strongly suggesting that the aggregations of animals attracted by artificial reefs concentrated nutrients in this oligotrophic seascape, favoring the growth of fast-growing primary producers like microphytobenthos and periphyton, and changing the competitively dominant seagrass from slow-growing T. testudinum to faster-growing H. wrightii {{in the vicinity of the}} reefs...|$|E
40|$|Many {{marine fishes}} use the {{mangrove}} ecosystem for foraging, protection, spawning, {{and as a}} nursery habitat. To develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the coastal mangrove and coral reef ecosystems, the ontogentic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes were examined through the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) stable isotope ratios. Juvenile and adult <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus griseus, lane snapper L. synagris, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, French grunt H. flavolineatum, sailor’s choice H. parra, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda were collected from both mangrove and coral reef sites located near Port Everglades, Broward County, Florida. All species were analyzed for δ 13 C and δ 15 N of muscle tissues and δ 18 O and δ 13 C of otoliths to evaluate ontogenetic migrations, foraging, and occupation within both the mangrove and reef sites. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N in muscle tissue were more depleted in juvenile fish from the mangroves than their adult forms caught on the adjacent reef. The δ 18 O and δ 13 C otolith data were significantly different between species, age class, and habitat, with lower δ 18 O values for juvenile fish caught in the mangroves. A general trend of increasing δ 13 C in otoliths corresponded to increasing total length, also suggesting juvenile movements from mangrove to nearshore reefs with age. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} further confirm that several commercially and recreationally important reef-associated fishes utilize mangrove ecosystems during juvenile life stages...|$|E
40|$|This study {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a survey designed to provide economic information about the financial status of commercial reef fish boats with homeports in the Florida Keys. A survey questionnaire was administered in the summer and fall of 1994 by interviewers in face-to-face meetings with owners or operators of randomly selected boats. Fishermen were asked for background information about themselves and their boats, their capital investments in boats and equipment, and about their average catches, revenues, and costs per trip for their two most important kinds of fishing trips during 1993 for species in the reef fish fishery. Respondents were characterized with regard to their dependence on the reef fish fishery as a source of household income. Boats were described in terms of their physical and financial characteristics. Different kinds of fishing trips were identified by the species that generated the greatest revenue. Trips were grouped into the following categories: yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus); mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), or red grouper (Epinephelus morio); <b>gray</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus griseus); deeper water groupers and tilefishes; greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili); spiny lobster (Panulirus argus); king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla); and dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus). Average catches, revenues, routine trip costs, and net operating revenues per boat per trip and per boat per year were estimated for each category of fishing trips. In addition to its descriptive value, data collected during this study will aid in future examinations of the economic effects of various regulations on commercial reef fish fishermen.
