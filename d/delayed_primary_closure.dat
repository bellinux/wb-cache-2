40|$|Damage control {{laparotomy}} {{has become}} an accepted practice in trauma surgery. A number of methods leading to <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of the abdomen have been advocated; complications are recognized with all these methods. The approach to staged repair using the Wittmann patch (Star Surgical Inc., Burlington, WI) combines the advantages of planned relaparotomy and open management, while minimizing the rate of complications. The authors hypothesized that use of the Wittmann patch {{would lead to a}} high rate of <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of the abdomen. The patch consists of two sheets sutured to the abdominal fascia, providing for temporary closure. Advancement of the patch and abdominal exploration can be done at bedside. When the fascial edges can be reapproximated without tension, abdominal closure is performed. Twenty-six pa-tients underwent staged abdominal closure during the study period.

40|$|Background: It {{is still}} {{a matter of debate}} whether <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> (DPC) of {{contaminated}} abdominal incision reduces surgical site infection compared with primary closure (PC). The rate of wound infection for dirty abdominal wound is approximately 40 %,but the optimal method of wound closure remains controversial. Aims and objectives: To determine whether delayed primary skin closure of contaminated and dirty abdominal wounds reduces the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) compared with primary skin closure. Method: Patient diagnosed as acute peritonitis and posted for exploratory laparotomy during the period of October 1 2013 to September 1 2015 were included. The study was conducted at Shri B M Patil Medical College and Hospital, Bijapur. In this series a total of 100 patients were included and were divided in two groups. Each group had 50 patients. For primary closure group, wounds were closed with monofilament interrupted suture. For <b>Delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure,</b> skin and subcutaneous tissue are left open and packed with 10 % (betadine) povidone iodine soaked gauge, which was changed daily to prevent excessive collection of exudates. The outcome of wound was assessed on post –operative days. Result: In this entire series, wound infection developed after incision closure was 33 %. The primary group had a higher rate of wound infection 54 % and <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> was 12 % (P< 0. 001) and longer length of hospital stay 19. 4 days in primary closure group and 16. 5 days in <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> group (P< 0. 002).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Open abdomen (OA) therapy {{frequently}} {{results in}} a giant planned ventral hernia. Vacuum-assisted wound closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction (VAWCM) enables <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure</b> in most patients, even after prolonged OA treatment. Our aim was to study the incidence of hernia and abdominal wall discomfort 1 year after abdominal closure. METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study of 111 patients undergoing OA/VAWCM was performed during 2006 - 2009. Surviving patients underwent clinical examination, computed tomography (CT), and chart review at 1 year. Incisional and parastomal hernias and abdominal wall symptoms were noted. RESULTS: The median age for the 70 surviving patients was 68 years, 77 % of whom were male. Indications for OA were visceral pathology (n = 40), vascular pathology (n = 22), or trauma (n = 8). Median length of OA therapy was 14 days. Among 64 survivors who had <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure,</b> 23 (36 %) had a clinically detectable hernia and another 19 (30 %) had hernias that were detected on CT (n = 18) or at laparotomy (n = 1). Symptomatic hernias were found in 14 (22 %), 7 of them underwent repair. The median hernia widths in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 7. 3 and 4. 8 cm, respectively (p = 0. 031) with median areas of 81. 0 and 42. 9 cm(2), respectively (p = 0. 025). Of 31 patients with a stoma, 18 (58 %) had a parastomal hernia. Parastomal hernia (odds ratio 8. 9; 95 % confidence interval 1. 2 - 68. 8) was the only independent factor associated with an incisional hernia. CONCLUSIONS: Incisional hernia incidence 1 year after OA therapy with VAWCM was high. Most hernias were small and asymptomatic, unlike the giant planned ventral hernias of the past...|$|R

40|$|Background: Primary {{closure of}} skin wounds after {{debridement}} of open fractures is controversial. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine whether primary skin closure for grade-IIIA or lower-grade open extremity fractures is associated with a lower deep-infection rate. Methods: We identified 349 Gustilo-Anderson grade-I, II, or IIIA fractures treated at our level-I academic trauma center from 2003 to 2007. Eighty-seven injuries were treated with <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure,</b> and 262 were treated with immediate closure after surgical debridement. After application of a propensity score-matching algorithm to balance prognostic factors, 146 open fractures (seventy-three matched pairs) were analyzed. Results: After application of a propensity score-matching algorithm with adjustment for age, sex, time to debridement, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, fracture grade, evidence of gross contamination, and a tibial fracture rather than a fracture at another anatomic site, the two treatment groups were compared with respect to the prevalence of infection. Deep infection developed at the sites of three of the seventy-three fractures treated with immediate closure (infection rate, 4. 1 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 86 to 11. 5) compared with thirteen in the matched group of seventy-three fractures treatedwith <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> (infection rate, 17. 8 %; 95 %CI, 9. 8 to 28. 5) (McNemar test, p = 0. 0001).

30|$|The {{success rate}} of {{abdominal}} closure mostly depends on the aetiology of the open abdomen [31]. Currently, application of abdominal NPT has extended the 'window' for <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure</b> from 4 to 5 days (in cases of trauma when principles of 'damage control' are applied) to as long as 1 month (in patients with complicated IAI) after the initial procedure [28, 32]. A study by Kaplan et al. [5] clearly shows that, if the abdomen is not primarily closed within 7 to 10 days, adhesion formation and fascia retraction can render this impossible. If the application time is too long and the NPT system changes are too frequent, the rate of entero-cutaneous fistula formation, bowel obstruction, bleeding and other complications can increase [26, 27, 32 – 34]. Mortality rates vary between 7 % and 38 % [4, 35] and can even reach 50 % in patients with peritonitis, severe sepsis or septic shock [10, 25].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The optimal {{treatment}} {{concept for}} temporary abdominal closure (TAC) in critically ill visceral surgery patients with open abdomen (OA) {{continues to be}} unclear. The VACM (vacuum-assisted closure and mesh-mediated fascial traction) therapy seems to permit higher <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure</b> rates (FCR) than other TAC procedures. Material and methods: Patients of our clinic (n= 58) who were treated by application of a VAC/VACM treatment manual in the period from 2005 to 2008 were retrospectively analysed. Results: The overall FCR of all patients was 48. 3 % (95 % confidence interval: 34. 95 – 61. 78). An FCR of 61. 3 % was achieved in patients who had a vicryl mesh implanted at the fascial level (VACM therapy) {{in the course of}} treatment.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Open tibial {{fractures}} {{have been}} studied extensively in adults, and detailed treatment strategies have been developed: wound irrigation and debridement, fracture stabilization and <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> wound <b>closure</b> or early flap coverage are basic principles of management. No clear guidelines regarding the management of open tibial fractures in children exist. SOURCES OF DATA: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases using the keywords: 'open', 'tibia', 'fracture', 'children', 'paediatric', 'pediatric', 'external fixation', 'nailing'. Fourteen clinical studies were included. Quality of the studies was assessed using the Coleman Methodology Score. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Age above 10 years and grade III (severe) open fractures are associated with complications and outcomes {{similar to those in}} adults. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It is unclear whether open fractures of the tibia in children should be managed according to the principles followed in adults. Many authors support <b>primary</b> skin <b>closure</b> and non-operative management for grade I open fractures. There is no clear effect of fracture fixation method on time to union. GROWING POINTS: The quality of the studies was relatively poor. Patients' age affects outcome; adolescents should probably be managed as adults. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Carefully designed prospective cohort studies including a large number of children would be of value.

40|$|Background. Failure {{to achieve}} <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure</b> (DPFC) {{is one of}} the main {{complications}} of open abdomen (OA), certainly when abdominal sepsis is present. This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the effect of combined therapy of vacuum-assisted mesh-mediated fascial traction and topical instillation (VAWCM-instillation) on DPFC in the open septic abdomen. Methods. The patients with abdominal sepsis who underwent OA using VAWCM were included and divided into the instillation and noninstillation (control) groups. The DPFC rate and other outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results. Between 2007 and 2013, 73 patients with open septic abdomen were treated with VAWCM-instillation and 61 cases with VAWCM-only. The DPFC rate in the instillation group was significantly increased (63 % versus 41 %, P= 0. 011). The mortality with OA was similar (24. 6 % versus 23 %, P= 0. 817) between the two groups. However, time to DPFC (P= 0. 003) and length of stay in hospital (P= 0. 022) of the survivals were significantly decreased in the instillation group. In addition, VAWCM-instillation (OR 1. 453, 95 % CI 1. 222 – 4. 927, P= 0. 011) was an independent influencing factor related to successful DPFC. Conclusions.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThere are {{numerous}} methods {{of treatment for}} pilonidal abscess; however the best method in acute pilonidal abscess has remained controversial. The present {{study was designed to}} compare drainage, <b>delayed</b> excision and <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> with excision and secondary healing in this relation. MethodsIn a randomized clinical trial study among 102 patients with definite diagnosis of pilonidal abscess referred to the Colorectal Clinic of Nemazee Hospital, 80 patients who fulfilled the criteria of entering the study were selected and divided into two groups of A and B. The exclusion criteria were any history of pilonidal abscess operation, diabetes mellitus, renal failure and immunosuppression. In group A, drainage and delayed excision (3 weeks afterwards) and <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> were performed while in group B, excision and secondary healing was performed. Patients were followed twice a week for 1 month and then 2, 6 and 12 months after the operation. The two methods were compared in terms of time period for wound healing, postoperative complications and any sign of recurrence. ResultsSymptoms were relieved in all patients. All patients returned to work 7 – 9 days after the operation. After 6 months, there was no signs of recurrence in both groups. After 12 months in group B, the same results were observed as previous months while in group A, 14 % developed recurrence of pilonidal abscess. Wound infection was noticed in 5. 6 % of patients in group A and 2. 5 % in group B and the difference was not significant (p> 0. 05). All patients in group B developed wound healing during 6 weeks except two of them who had a delay in this finding up to 8 weeks. ConclusionThe results of drainage and <b>primary</b> wound <b>closure</b> were comparable to the excision and secondary wound healing except in the rate of recurrence which was more frequent in the <b>primary</b> wound <b>closure.</b> As a result, in spite of much property and comfort of <b>primary</b> wound <b>closure,</b> this method would not be recommended for all cases with acute pilonidal abscess...|$|R
40|$|Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to systematically review the literature to assess which temporary abdominal closure (TAC) technique is associated with the highest <b>delayed</b> <b>primary</b> fascial <b>closure</b> (FC) rate. In some cases of abdominal trauma or infection, edema or packing precludes fascial closure after laparotomy. This "open abdomen'' must then be temporarily closed. However, the FC rate varies between techniques. Methods The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched until December 2007. References were checked for additional studies. Search criteria included (synonyms of) "open abdomen,'' "fascial closure,'' "vacuum,'' "reapproximation,'' and "ventral hernia. '' Open abdomen was defined as "the inability to close the abdominal fascia after laparotomy. '' Two reviewers independently extracted data from original articles by using a predefined checklist. Results The search identified 154 abstracts of which 96 were considered relevant. No comparative studies were identified. After reading them, 51 articles, including 57 case series were included. The techniques described were vacuum-assisted closure (VAC; 8 series), vacuum pack (15 series), artificial burr (4 series), Mesh/sheet (16 series), zipper (7 series), silo (3 series), skin closure (2 series), dynamic retention sutures (DRS), and loose packing (1 series each). The highest FC rates were seen in the artificial burr (90 %), DRS (85 %), and VAC (60 %). The lowest mortality rates were seen in the artificial burr (17 %), VAC (18 %), and DRS (23 %).

There was no major bile leakage in the T-tube group but one patient in the <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> group had major bile leakage, which was treated conservatively without surgical or endoscopic intervention. Wound infection was seen in two patients in the T-tube group and one patient in the <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> group. In follow up assessment, there was no intra-abdominal collection in both groups. Overall postoperative complications include biliary complications, wound infection and intra-abdominal collections, were seen in four patients in the T-tube group and six patients in <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> group; that was not statically significant difference. Conclusion: <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of CBD after open choledocotomy is feasible and is as safe as T-tube insertion. In effect, <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> avoids T-tube insertion and disadvantages {{associated with the use}} of T-tube. <b>Primary</b> <b>closure</b> can be recommended for selected patients with CBD stone disease.   Key words: common bile duct stones; choledocotomy; T-tube drainage; primary closur...|$|R
40|$|Abstraction Background <b>Primary</b> <b>closure</b> {{following}} laparoscopic common {{bile duct}} exploration (LCBDE) has been widely adopted because of the efficacy and safety in treatment of {{common bile duct}} (CBD) stones. However, the risk factors for bile leakage, the most common complication after <b>primary</b> <b>closure,</b> has not been clarified yet. Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent LCBDE with <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> after choledochotomy between Feb. 2012 and Jun. 2016 was performed. Risk factors for bile leakage were identified by logistic regression inculding demographic factors, preoperative condition and surgical details. Results Between Feb. 2012 and Jun. 2016, a total of 265 LCBDE procedures were applied in our hospital and 141 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> were included in this study. Bile leakage occurred in 11. 3...|$|R
40|$|Choledochotomy {{followed}} by T-tube {{has long been}} a standard surgical treatment for choledocholithiasis. It is still a preferred choice in many hospitals where minimal invasive procedures are not feasible. The use of T-tube is not without complications. To avoid the complications associated with T-tube, we have performed <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of the common bile duct (CBD) after exploration. This pilot study assesses the safety of <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of CBD, which would help form a basis for implementation on a wider scale. Objective: To compare the clinical results of <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> with T-tube drainage after open choledochotomy and assess the safety of <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> for future application on a greater mass. Patients and Methods: This comparative study was conducted at surgical unit IV Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro, from January 2007 to December 2007. Thirty-five patients were included in the study of which 16 patients underwent <b>primary</b> <b>closure.</b> Results: Thirty-five patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients who had <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> done (n = 16) was 46. 0 ± 16. 8 and there were two (12. 5 %) males and 14 (87. 5 %) females. After <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> of the CBD, bile leakage was noted in one patient (6. 3 %), which subsided without any biliary peritonitis as compared to the T-tube group in which two patients (10. 5 %) had bile leakage. Postoperative jaundice was seen in one patient (5. 3 %) who had a T-tube because of a blockage of CBD. Not a single patient had a retained stone in both groups as well as no recurrence of CBD stones. The postoperative hospital stay after <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> was 5. 56 ± 1. 1 days as compared to after T-tube drainage which was 13. 6 ± 2. 3 days. The total cost of treatment in patients who underwent <b>primary</b> <b>closure</b> was USD 194. 5 ± 41. 5 but after T-tube drainage it was USD 548. 6 ± 88. 5. The median follow up duration for both groups was 6 months. Conclusion: <b>Primary</b> CBD <b>closure</b> is a safe and cost effective alternative to routine T-tube drainage after open choledochotomy...|$|R
