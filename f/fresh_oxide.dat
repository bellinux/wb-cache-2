40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for {{rejection}} of wheel castings is the formation of shrinkage defects at the spoke-rim junction. Industrial trials show that the severity of defects is accentuated by the addition of grain refiner beyond an optimum level. Subsequent laboratory castings also found that the addition of grain refiners beyond this optimum level increased the size of the defect at hot spots in a casting. This is explained by a decrease in the size of interdendritic channels during feeding when the grain size is reduced. Therefore feeding becomes restricted earlier in grain refined castings and thus a larger amount of shrinkage needs to be accommodated in the hot spot. It was also observed that when plentiful <b>fresh</b> <b>oxide</b> films are present then the nucleation of porosity is favoured. However, when <b>fresh</b> <b>oxide</b> films have not been generated, then external shrinkage (slumping of the casting surface) is more likely to occur...|$|E

In this new electrochemical reduction process, electrolysis of Li 2 O and reduction of uranium oxide are taking place simultaneously at the cathode part of electrolysis cell. Li produced via Li 2 O electrolysis reacts with uranium oxide resulting in the formation of Li 2 O of which oxygen ion originates from uranium oxide. The resultant Li 2 O is electrolysed and regenerated Li is used for further reduction of the uranium oxide. The cathode part consisted of uranium oxide, stainless steel conductor, and a nonconductive porous magnesia filter.

To effectively decrease bacterial attachment, colonization, and subsequent development of periprosthetic infection, we previously described {{a method to}} covalently bond vancomycin to smooth Ti alloy surfaces. To attach vancomycin, the Ti surface is first passivated to create a <b>fresh</b> <b>oxide</b> layer. Previously, passivation has been achieved with an H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O 2 etch that can destroy the topography of the underlying implant.

These hydrothermally passivated Kirschner wires and smooth or beaded Ti surfaces were chemically coupled with vancomycin. Antibiotic-coupled samples representing all three geometries were uniformly covered with antibiotic, resisted colonization by Staphylococcus aureus for longer than 8  hours, and retained their biocompatibility as assessed by normal attachment and morphology of preosteocytic MLO-A 5 cells.

40|$|In a chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) process, gas (natural gas, syngas, etc) is {{burnt in}} two reactors. In the first one, a metallic oxide {{that is used}} as oxygen source is reduced by the feeding gas to a lower oxidation state, being CO 2 and steam the reaction products. In the second reactor, the reduced solid is regenerated with air to the <b>fresh</b> <b>oxide,</b> and the process can be repeated for many successive cycles. CO 2 can be easily recovered from the outlet gas coming from the first reactor by simple steam condensation. Consequently, CLC is a clean process for the combustion of carbon containing fuels preventing the CO 2 emissions to atmosphere. The main drawback of the overall process is that the carriers are subjected to strong chemical and thermal stresses in every cycle and the performance and mechanical strength can decay down to unacceptable levels after enough number of cycles in use. In this paper the behaviour of CuO as an oxygen carrier for a CLC process has been analysed in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The effects of carrier composition and preparation method used have been investigated to develop Cu-based carriers exhibiting high reduction and oxidation rates without substantial changes in the chemical, structural and mechanical properties for {{a high number of}} oxidation-reduction cycles. It has been observed that the carriers prepared by mechanical mixing or by coprecipitation showed an excellent chemical stability in multicycle tests in thermobalance, however, the mechanical properties of these carriers were highly degraded to unacceptable levels. On the other hand, the carriers prepared by impregnation exhibited excellent chemical stability without substantial decay of the mechanical strength in multicycle testing. These results suggest that copper based carriers prepared by impregnation are good candidates for chemical-looping combustion process.

Interaction of CO and NOX with tin oxide nanoparticles is presented and discussed.

The catalysts were characterized using {{a number of different}} techniques both before and after reaction testing to gain understanding of how material traits influence their catalytic performance. A number of potentially important catalytic properties were found to be of little importance for the respective reaction. For instance, it was discovered that there was no direct correlation between prereaction surface area with activity for ketonization at high or at low temperatures. Furthermore, better reducibility of the oxide did not appear to correlate with improved ketonization rates. XRD of postreaction materials used at different temperatures demonstrated the reaction temperature regime influenced whether the crystal structure of the <b>fresh</b> mixed <b>oxide</b> was disrupted.

Batch experiments without shaking were conducted for 14 days mostly with five different ZVI materials (15 g/l), selected ligands (10 mM) and an U(VI) solution (20 mg/l, 0. 084 mM). Apart from Cl-, all tested ligands induced a decrease ofU(VI) coprecipitation. This decrease is attributed to the surface adsorption and complexation of the ligands at the reactive sites {{on the surface of}} ZVI and their corrosion products. The decrease ofU(VI) removal was not uniform with the five ZVI materials. Generally, groundwater with elevated EDTA concentration could not be remediated with the ZVI barrier technology. The response of the system on the pre-treating by two ZVI materials in 250 mM HCl indicated that in situ generated corrosion products favor an irreversible U(VI) uptake.

40|$|In {{many regions}} of the world, {{groundwater}} is contaminated {{with a high level}} of arsenic that must be treated before it can be safely used as drinking water. In situ immobilization of arsenic from groundwater within subsurface environment could have major advantages over the conventional above-ground chemical coagulation-precipitation treatment process. In this study, we develop a novel technique that can in situ emplace iron oxides onto the sand grain surface of porous media under mild chemical and temperature conditions. The technique involves sequential injections of a preconditioned ferrous iron solution and an oxidant solution and then orchestrate the advective-diffusive transport of the two reagents in porous media to create an overlapped reaction zone where ferrous iron is oxidized and precipitated on the sand grain surfaces. We demonstrate through bench-scale column tests the feasibility of using this technique to create a large-scale iron oxide-enriched reactive barrier in subsurface environment for in situ removal of arsenic. A sand filter with a <b>fresh</b> iron <b>oxide</b> coating can treat thousands of pore volumes of water contaminated with dozens of ppb arsenic before the coating needs to be regenerated. Arsenic breakthrough curves through the sand filter suggest that both reversible adsorption and irreversible precipitation are responsible for removing arsenic from the water.

40|$|Iron oxide-bearing {{minerals}} {{have long}} been recognized as an effective reactive media for arsenic-contaminated groundwater remediation. This research aimed to develop a technique that could facilitate in situ oxidative precipitation of Fe 3 + in a soil (sand) media for generating a subsurface iron oxide-based reactive barrier that could immobilize arsenic (As) and other dissolved metals in groundwater. A simple in situ arsenic treatment process was successfully developed for treating contaminated rural groundwater using iron oxide-coated sand (IOCS). Using imbibition flow, the system facilitated the dispersive transport of ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) and oxidant solutions in porous sand to generate an overlaying blanket where the Fe 2 + was oxidized and precipitated onto the surface as ferric oxide. The iron oxide (FeOx) emplacement process was significantly affected by (1) the initial surface area and surface-bound iron content of the sand, (2) the pH and solubility of the coating reagents, (3) {{the stability of the}} oxidant solution, and (4) the chemical injection schedule. In contrast to conventional excavate-and-fill treatment technologies, this technique could be used to in situ replace a <b>fresh</b> iron <b>oxide</b> blanket on the sand and rejuvenate its treatment capacity for additional arsenic removal. Several bench-scale experiments revealed that the resultant IOCS could treat arsenic-laden groundwater for extended periods of time before approaching its effective life cycle. The adsorption capacity for As(III) and As(V) was influenced by (1) the amount of iron oxide accumulated on the sand surface, (2) the system pH, and (3) competition for adsorption sites from other groundwater constituents such as silicon (Si) and total dissolved solids (TDS). Although the IOCS could be replenished several times before exhaustion, the life cycle of the FeOx reactive barrier may be limited by the gradual loss of hydraulic conductivity induced by the imminent reduction of pore space over time...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{construction}} materials in machine and equipment manufacture as well as vehicle and aircraft construction. Particularly, in automotive and aircraft industries, the adhesive bonding of aluminium requires the pre-treatment of the adhesive surfaces. In this study laser pre-treatments were used to laterally control the surface roughness and clean the substrate surfaces by forming <b>fresh</b> aluminium <b>oxide</b> layers. In order to keep the adhesive properties stable over time, the laser pre-treated aluminium surfaces were subsequently coated with weak polyelectrolytes. The applied polyelectrolytes lower the driving forces for the adsorption of unwanted surface contaminations and provide reactive amino groups for the subsequent coupling of reactive adhesives. The surface topographies of the laser-treated aluminium surfaces were investigated in relation to the applied laser parameters (such as pulse frequency, and laser power) by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light-microscopic techniques (confocal microscopy). The adsorption of the polyelectrolytes was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Inverse water contact angle measurements using captive air bubbles were carried out to study the wettability (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) of the modified aluminium surfaces. Single lap joint tests carried out on joined AlMg 3 sheets showed that the shear strengths can be significantly increased by pre-treatment with laser and coating of the alloy surfaces with weak polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, the application of polyelectrolytes improved the stability against corrosion. The article shows the increase of tensile shear strengths at adhesively bonded single lap shear samples after laser pre-treatment and also an increase in long-term stability due to of the combination of laser pre-treatment and coating with polyelectrolytes. Adhesive bonds of laser treated samples with and without polyelectrolyte coating have a higher stability against corrosion compared to untreated samples...|$|R

Growth of SS- 1 in the defined medium with pyruvate as a carbon and energy source required the addition of vitamin B 12. Complete oxidation of Mn(II) within 60 h required the addition of ≥ 0. 1 μM FeSO 4. Pb adsorption isotherms were determined for the biogenic Mn oxides (and associated cells with their extracellular polymer) and compared to the Pb adsorption isotherms of cells and exopolymer alone, {{as well as to}} abiotic Mn oxides. The Pb adsorption to cells and exopolymer with biogenic Mn oxides (0. 8 mmol of Mn per g) at pH 6. 0 and 25 °C was 2 orders of magnitude greater than the Pb adsorption to cells and exopolymer alone (on a dry weight basis). The Pb adsorption to the biogenic Mn oxide was two to five times greater than the Pb adsorption to a chemically precipitated abiotic Mn oxide and several orders of magnitude greater than the Pb adsorption to two commercially available crystalline MnO 2 minerals. The N 2 Brunauer-Emmet-Teller specific surface areas of the biogenic Mn <b>oxide</b> and <b>fresh</b> Mn <b>oxide</b> precipitate (224 and 58 m 2 /g, respectively) were significantly greater than those of the commercial Mn oxide minerals (0. 048 and 4. 7 m 2 /g).

40|$|B 9 8 9 = =; < eposits {{formed on}} {{surfaces}} of the containing system during circulation of aqueous ThO/sub 2 / slurries at high temperature. Although entire surfaces of systems were coated with 1 / 4 to 1 / 8 -in. - thick thoria deposits, cake formation was usually localized, forming preferentially in the pump impeller. Frequently, impeller deposits accelerated bearing failure. Cake formation was usually accompanied by formation of equal dense spherical aggregates 5 to 60 mu in diameter which remained suspended in the slurry. Caking and sphere forming phenomena, as investigated by tests of slurry properties in the laboratory and in a 30 -gpm slurry loop, are described, as are methods for preventing caking. Thoria cakes and spheres are believed to form by reagglomeration of small particles or fragments worn or chipped off the larger thoria particles composing the initial slurry. It is thought that small fragments are forced over each other by the shear stress into positions of minimum energy where they are held together by van der Waals' forces. Thoria solubility is not believed to be an appreciable factor in cske or sphere formation. The extent of chemical bonding in the deposits is not clear. Greatest cake-forming tendency was noted in thoria prepared by calcination of Th(C/sub 2 /O/sub 4 /) /sub 2 / at 800 deg C, though cakes did occur with other ThO/ sub 2 / preparations. Deposits formed from oxide batches that contained particles more resistant to degradation were softer, apparently because there were fewer fine fragments. A deposition preference between different metal surfaces {{as well as between}} differert velocity sections was noted. Cake formation by fresh batches of thoria, that is, slurry in which the initial oxide particles were not made finer by previous circulation, is prevented by any factor which reduces particle comminution. Cake formation is avoided if particles are too resistant to degradation or if they degrade rapidly to intermediate-size particles. Intermediate-size particles, 0. 1 to 0. 5 mu, apparently do not yield fine fragments readily because of the reduced shear forces which are acting on smaller particles. Improved particle integrity can be accomplished by the method of oxide preparation, for example, the use of high calcining temperature or long digestion time. Cake formation by <b>fresh</b> <b>oxides</b> is also prevented by the addition of small quantities of surface-active electrolytes to the slurry. Effective electrolytes tested included CrO/sub 3 /, NsAlO/sub 2 /, Na/sub 2 /SiO/sub 3 /, and MoO/sub 3 /. The electrolytes are thought to be effective by means of reducing particle fragmentation. Prevention of cske formation by slurries already containing particles in the caking-size range (e. g., a slurry composed of spheres produced during circulation) is more difficult, because agglomeration of the fine particles must be prevented. Lithium sulfate tended to reduce cake formation but was not completely effective. Other electrolyte additives tested (CrO/sub 3 / and NsAlO/sub 2 /) failed to hinder cake formation during ThC/sub 2 / sphere circulation. (These spheres were "loop produced" in a previous slurry circulation experiment.) However, after extended circulation during which partial dispersion of the spheres took place, cake formation was almost absent. It is postulated that the very fine particles wearing off the spheres gradually agglomerate into particles which are too large to form cskes but so small that fine particles or fragments are not worn off readily. Autoclaving of fresh thoria in water or dilute acids did not strengthen the particles sufficiently to prevent cake formation. Cake formation did not occur when the loop circulation temperature was reduced to 45 deg C. Extremely low thoria concentration did not deter cake formation. The integrity of loop-produced spheres was greatly improved by a combination of chemical and thermal treatment but was not improved sufficiently to prevent cake formation. Cake deposited in a ThO/sub 2 /- circulation system is partially destroyed by thermal cycling and can be remove...|$|R

The first one consists {{in the study of}} ReO by the mean of thermogravimetry analysis. A mass spectrometer was used too, to get more information. Two different ReO are studied: yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) and gadolinium oxide (Gd 2 O 3). The ReO have been synthesized changing the most important initial parameter regarding the changes in the properties obtained. This parameter is the ratio glycine to rare earth nitrates (G/N), the two reactants used for the synthesis. The conclusions for this part are the following: for an excess of nitrates, the impurities in the oxides are mostly due to carbon residues, nitrates and carbonates. The amount of carbonates seems to scale with the specific surface area of the powder, while nitrates decrease when less in excess. The synthesis is carried out at 500 ¢XC in this study but the conclusion is that carrying out the synthesis at 600 „aC or increasing the temperature to 600 „aC after synthesis might allow for complete removal of nitrate without altering the structure too much. For the stoichiometric ratio, nitrates and carbonates can hardly be resolved by DTG. However, 46 % of the total weight loss occurs above 460 „aC for Y 2 O 3. For an excess of glycine, unreacted glycine is found. A major difference in the chemical properties of the two oxides has been found as well. It is the heat of reaction released during the synthesis which does not show the same trend if we look at its evolution increasing the G/N ratio. The second part of this work consists {{in the study of the}} changes of some parameters in the synthesis on the ReO properties. Two parameters are tested: the mixing changing its speed and glycine from different brands (one aged of 20 years). It does not show major differences looking at adsorption and desorption of nitrogen measurements. Nevertheless, other ways have to be investigated like the concentration of rare earth nitrates solution for example. The last part is the study of the aging of ReO. Y 2 O 3 for a G/N ratio of 0. 56 is studied.

A subsequent study of copper-based methanol synthesis catalysts explored the impact of gas phase conditions on the catalyst state. A mixture of steady-state testing and transient response experiments (i. e. via an imposed change in gas phase conditions over the catalyst) provided new insights into the evolution of active site populations and populations of surface species on the catalyst surface. Overall, the reaction kinetics studies demonstrated across this thesis demonstrate not only a series of methods to understand catalyst behaviour in depth but also to understand the key functional requirements for an effective industrial catalyst. ...|$|R
40|$|EGU 2012 - 10224 Harbour and marina sediments {{represent}} particular environments, {{with high}} concentrations in organic carbon and pollutants. Over 50 million m 3 of marine sediments are dredged {{every year in}} French maritime and commercial ports, to maintain the water depth suitable for navigation, and the most part of them is discharged in deeper sea zones. The present study aimed to elucidate, using a range of complementary approaches, the influence of bacterial activity on arsenic speciation and mobility in marina sediments. Two sites were considered: L'Estaque, impacted by metallurgical activities and by the commercial port of Marseille, and St-Mandrié, less polluted, affected by classical chemical pollutants associated to professional and recreational boating. Arsenic concentration was noticeably higher in l'Estaque sediment (200 - 350 mg/kg) than in St-Mandrier sediment (15 - 50 mg/kg). In the solid phases, As(III) was the dominant species in L'Estaque sediment, whereas As(V) was the main form in St Mandrier sediment. At both sites, arsenic was the major trace element detected in interstitial water. Free sulfide and thio-arsenic complexes were detected in the interstitial water of l'Estaque sediment, suggesting a role of sulfate-reduction bacterial activity on arsenic solubility. Anaerobic microcosm experiments confirmed this hypothesis, as stimulation of sulfate-reduction induced a dramatic increase of arsenic concentration in the liquid phase, linked {{to the formation of}} soluble thio-arsenic complexes. Nevertheless, microcosms performed in aerobic conditions showed that bacterial activity globally decreased the transfer of arsenic from the sediment toward the overlying water. A red-brown fine layer developed at the sediment-water interface. Altogether, these results suggest that the sediment-water interface zone and the close transition area between aerobic and anaerobic conditions host intense biogeochemical reactions involving As, Fe and S species. These reactions most probably include dissolution of FeS (which confers to the muddy sediment its deep dark color), oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), oxidation of As(III) to As(V), oxidation of S(-II) to S°, S(VI) and maybe other intermediate species, adsorption of As(V) onto <b>fresh</b> iron <b>oxides.</b> Bacterial activity tests applied to the crude sediments indicated that As(III) -oxidizing and As(V) -reducing micro-organisms have the potential to be active at both sites Detection of aoxB and arrA genes, respectively specific to As(III) -oxidation and respiratory As(V) -reduction, revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities able to contribute to As transformation in both St-Mandrier and l'Estaque marina sediments. As(III) -oxidizing bacteria probably contribute to the biogeochemical stabilization of arsenic, wherever electron acceptors are available. Whereas reducing conditions prevail in organic carbon-rich marina sediment, bacteria able to oxidize As(III) are present and can be rapidly active as soon as electron acceptors are available. The present study showed that arsenic, which inorganic forms As(III) and As(V) are particularly toxic, {{is one of the most}} mobile pollutants in polluted marina sediments. The biogeochemical reactions governing its mobility should thus be considered in the management of sediment dredging operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this NETL sponsored bench-scale study was to demonstrate the efficacy of enhanced anaerobic reductive precipitation (EARP) technology for precipitating uranium using samples from contaminated groundwater at the Fernald Closure Project (FCP) in Cincinnati, Ohio. EARP enhances the natural biological reactions in the groundwater through addition of food grade substrates (typically molasses) to drive the oxidative-reductive potential of the groundwater to a lower, more reduced state, thereby precipitating uranium from solution. In order for this in-situ technology {{to be successful in}} the long term, the precipitated uranium must not be re-dissolved at an unacceptable rate once groundwater geochemical conditions return to their pretreatment, aerobic state. The approach for this study is {{based on the premise that}} redissolution of precipitated uranium will be slowed by several mechanisms including the presence of iron sulfide precipitates and coatings, and sorption onto <b>fresh</b> iron <b>oxides.</b> A bench-scale study of the technology was performed using columns packed with site soil and subjected to a continuous flow of uranium-contaminated site groundwater (476 {micro}g/L). The ''treated'' column received a steady stream of dilute food grade molasses injected into the contaminated influent. Upon attainment of a consistently reducing environment and demonstrated removal of uranium, an iron sulfate amendment was added along with the molasses in the influent solution. After a month long period of iron addition, the treatments were halted, and uncontaminated, aerobic, unamended water was introduced to the treated column to assess rebound of uranium concentrations. In the first two months of treatment, the uranium concentration in the treated column decreased to the clean-up level (30 {micro}g/L) or below, and remained there for the remainder of the treatment period. A brief period of resolubilization of uranium was observed as the treated column returned to aerobic conditions, but the concentration later returned to below the clean-up level. Speciation analysis was conducted on soil collected from the treated column after rebound testing. The experimental results show that: (a) The mass of uranium resolubilized in more than four months of column testing was much lower than the amount precipitated. (b) The majority of the uranium was precipitated in the first few inches of the treated column. The majority of the uranium precipitated was associated with iron oxides or in other immobile/sequestered phases. It is important to contrast this result with the results reported by Bryan (2003) who shows that most of the uranium associated with contaminated aquifer solids at Fernald under the existing natural attenuation/pump and treat with reinjection conditions is carbonate bound. Carbonate bound forms are traditionally seen as fairly mobile, but may not be under a calcite/dolomite saturated condition. Fernald is currently conducting further studies to investigate the mobility of the carbonate bound forms. (c) Though reoxidation concentrations from the bench-scale column exceeded 30 {micro}g/L for a time, they later returned to below this value. Effluent concentrations from the treated column are expected to over predict full-scale concentrations for reasons discussed in depth in the text. Finally, these results must be viewed in light of the site's ongoing pump-and-treat with reinjection system. There is reason to believe that although the pump-and-treat technology is currently effectively controlling the uranium plume and reducing the groundwater concentration, it may not be able to reach the treatment standard of 30 {micro}g/L within an economical operating lifetime and then maintain that concentration without rebound. This study suggests that Enhanced Anaerobic Reductive Precipitation can change the speciation and thus reduce the mobility of uranium at the site and expedite closure...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on safety aspects of Sodium cooled Fast Reactors (SFR) and the {{potential}} interaction of advanced-oxide fuels with the metallic coolant {{in case of a}} clad breach. Transuranium elements (Np, Pu, Am, Cm) are generated during the irradiation process in a reactor and constitute a major issue for the nuclear industry because of their toxicity and very long half life (2. 14 * 106, 2. 41 * 104 and 432. 2 years for 237 Np, 239 Pu and 241 Am respectively). One main objective of the international GEN-IV program is to operate in a so called closed fuel recycling cycle by incorporating the separated minor actinides (Np, Am, Cm) into the <b>fresh</b> Mixed <b>OXide</b> fuel (MOX) (U, Pu) O 2 and reusing them for energy generation. Such incorporation will however introduce a much more complex chemistry for which many data are still missing. Studies carried out in the past have revealed the formation close to the pellet rim (~ 923 K) of sodium urano-plutonate of formula Na 3 MO 4 (M=U, Pu, U 1 -xPux) upon the reaction between sodium and (U,Pu) O 2 fuels 1. This compound was shown to be of lower density and thermal conductivity than the fuel leading to local swelling and temperature increase, potentially enlarging the breach up to pin failure. Moreover the authors measured the thermodynamic potential or partial molar Gibbs energies of oxygen (∆GO 2 eq) of some urania and urania-plutonia solid solutions. They showed that the metallic coolant coming into contact with the urania-plutonia solid solution could lead to an oxygen concentration increase in the liquid sodium in conjunction with the reduction to a lower valency of the plutonium in the oxide phase [...] Other authors, Pillon 2 and Kleykamp 3 have contributed in the 1990 ’s to the investigation of the Na-U-O, Na-Pu-O and Na-UxPu 1 -x-O ternary and quaternary systems. The {{purpose of the present study}} is hence to assess the aftermaths on safety when minor-actinides-bearing-fuels come into contact with the metallic coolant. The work reported focuses on the chemical reactions between neptunium dioxide and sodium oxide in the presence of oxygen gas, leading to compounds with hexavalent and heptavalent neptunium. Solid state synthesis with different NpO 2 /Na 2 O ratios led to the following polycrystalline compounds: Na 2 Np 2 O 7 monoclinic (P 1211), α-Na 2 NpO 4 orthorhombic (Pbam), β-Na 4 NpO 5 tetragonal (I 4 /mmm) and Na 5 NpO 6 monoclinic (C 2 /m) 4. The crystal structures of the α-Na 2 NpO 4 and Na 2 Np 2 O 7 compounds were refined by Rietveld analysis. Evolution of the cell parameters of α-Na 2 NpO 4 was also followed as a function of temperature up to 1273 K by X-ray diffraction. The corresponding linear thermal expansion coefficients along the different axis were determined: αa = 41. 3 10 - 6 K- 1, αb = 35. 0 10 - 6 K- 1, αc ~ 0 K- 1. The high temperature X-ray diffraction experiment also revealed the formation of a high temperature γ phase tetragonal of Na 2 NpO 4 between 663 and 763 K and the transition to a β orthorhombic (Pbca) phase upon cooling to room temperature 4. Finally, thermodynamic measurements in a Knudsen effusion cell have given preliminary results on the vaporization behaviour of α-Na 2 NpO 4 when heated up to 2500 K under vacuum conditions. The latter experiment also stands as a promising method for the determination of the Gibbs energy of formation and enthalpy of formation of Na 2 NpO 4 at 298. 15 K. 1. 	M. A. Mignanelli and P. E.
