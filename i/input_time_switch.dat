The motion of the mobile agent is subject to position constraints char-acterizing an obstacle (keep-out region) as well as velocity, acceleration, and control constraints. The original optimal control problem {{is transformed into a}} mathematical programming problem where the obstacle is described by a set of linear constraints and <b>switching</b> <b>times,</b> which specify the sequence of active constraints corresponding to the obstacle. A two-stages decomposition method is proposed to solve the optimal control <b>inputs</b> and <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> and is verified through simulations. The proposed approach can be applied to solve general obstacle avoidance trajec-tory planning problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimal {{tracking}} problem for switched systems, where the control <b>input,</b> the <b>switching</b> <b>times</b> and the <b>switching</b> index are all design variables. We propose a three-stage method for solving this problem. First, we fix the <b>switching</b> <b>times</b> and <b>switching</b> index sequence, {{which leads to a}} linear tracking problem, except different subsystems are defined in their respective time intervals. The optimal control and the corresponding cost function obtained depend on the switching signal. This gives rise to an optimal parameter selection problem for which the switching instants and the switching index are to be chosen optimally. In the second stage, the switching index is fixed. A reverse time transformation followed by a time scaling transform are introduced to convert this subproblem into an equivalent standard optimal parameter selection problem. The gradient formula of the cost function is derived. Then the discrete filled function is used in the third stage to search for the optimal switching index. On this basis, a computational method, which combines a gradient-based method, a local search algorithm and a filled function method, is developed for solving this problem. A numerical exampleis solved, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

Replicated services are a good choice to resolve this problem. The transparency of information become increasingly important in the GSCM {{as a result of}} using caching, middleware and distributed database replication etc. technologies to improve the correctness of replicas in business operations. An efficient real-time replicas updating mechanism was proposed to maintain consistent and correct logistic and market information which was shared by all kinds of application systems in transnational enterprises. However, it is difficult for enterprise copies with local or remote original data source (ODS) object partial dependency relationships to maintain their consistency correctness and availableness. With these models, optimization of the correct copy <b>inputs</b> and <b>switching</b> <b>time</b> of each activity in a recursive routing are calculated to obtain the minimum total cost of the project. Finally, our results can be expanded for enterprise database replicas with correctness maintenance abilities. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we study the {{en-route}} strategic flight planning {{of a commercial}} aircraft constrained to pass {{through a set of}} waypoints whose sequence is not predefined. This problem has been solved as an hybrid optimal control problem in which, given the dynamic model of the aircraft, the initial and final states, the path constraints constituting the envelope of flight, and a set of waypoints in the European air space, one has to find the control <b>inputs,</b> the <b>switching</b> <b>times,</b> the optimal sequence of waypoints and the corresponding trajectory of the aircraft that minimize the direct operating cost during the flight. The complete layout of waypoints in the European airspace is reduced and waypoints are gathered into a small number of clusters. The aircraft is constrained to pass through one waypoint inside every cluster of waypoints. The presence of multi point constraints makes the optimal control problem particularly difficult to solve. The hybrid optimal control problem is converted into a mixed integer non linear programming problem first making the unknown <b>switching</b> <b>times</b> part of the state, then introducing binary variable to enforce the constraint of passing through one waypoint inside every cluster, and finally applying a direct collocation method. The resulting mixed integer non linear programming problem has been solved using a branch and bound algorithm. The cases studied and the numerical results show the effectiveness, efficiency and applicability of this method for enroute strategic flight plans definition...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a denoise-and-forward (DNF) two-way relay network (TWRN) with non-coherent differential binary phase-shift keying modulation, where a battery-free relay node harvests {{energy from the}} received radio frequency (RF) signals and uses the harvested energy to help the source nodes for information exchange. Based on the power splitting (PS) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> (TS) receiver architectures, power splitting relaying (PSR) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> relaying (TSR) protocols at relay are studied. In order to investigate the effect of power allocations on two source nodes, power splitting coefficient and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor at relay on performance, the two proposed protocols are analyzed and the bit error rate (BER) expressions of end-to-end system are derived. Based on these expressions, the optimal power of sources, the power splitting ratio and the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor are obtained via the numerical search method. The simulation and numerical results provide practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as the power splitting coefficient, the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor, sources to relay distances, the noise power, and the energy harvesting efficiency {{on the performance of}} this TWRN. In addition, the results show that the PSR protocol outperforms the TSR protocol in terms of throughput under various network geometries.|$|R

30|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} through radio frequency (RF) signals {{has emerged as}} the promising and effective solution to supply power and prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless networks. Since RF signals can carry both information and energy, it has recently attracted a lot of attention on research activities, especially on investigating simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [1 – 3]. In [4], an energy constrained relay node using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol was considered based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> and power splitting receiver architectures, respectively. Specifically, the authors investigated both the delay-limited and the non-delay-limited transmission and derived the analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity, respectively. Later on, the same authors extended the analysis to the throughput and ergodic capacity of DF relaying systems in [5]. Based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> receiver architecture, the authors in [6] proposed adaptive <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols for RF energy harvesting and information transmission for both AF and DF networks. They obtained analytical expressions of the achievable throughput for both the continuous and the discrete <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols.

40|$|Abstract. The {{recent decades}} have {{witnessed}} active studies in fault detection and isolation (FDD) {{of the small}} satellites subject to actuator failures and attitude coordination control of spacecraft formation flying (SFF) which plays a significant role in missions such as synthetic-aperture radar imaging. However, because of the time delay in communication links, the performance of coordination control is not always satisfactory. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the actuator fault as well as the <b>input</b> <b>time</b> delay at the same time. First of all, the model of the altitude control system of the small satellite with actuator fault and the model of the altitude control system with actuator fault and the <b>input</b> <b>time</b> delay are presented respectively. Based on the Two-Stage Kalman Filter algorithm, the fault and <b>input</b> <b>time</b> delay of the altitude control system of the small satellite can be estimated. At last, the simulation of the algorithm in a satellite attitude control system with actuator fault and <b>input</b> <b>time</b> delay will illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
