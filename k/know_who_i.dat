500|$|Marmarosa {{continued}} {{to perform in}} Pittsburgh, albeit irregularly. Around 1963, DeFranco dropped by; he recalled that the pianist [...] "would play brilliantly for half a tune, then just stop and walk away. He didn't even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was". Marmarosa's last performance in public has been dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early-to-mid 1970s. Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement. [...] "Even the resurgence of interest in bebop in the 1970s and 80s did not {{bring him back to}} national attention", reported The New York Times.|$|E

[...] She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property. Used in the film as a last-minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis [...] "to find her own voice as a newly independent woman", co-writer Anne Preven called [...] "Listen" [...] a song which [...] "Deena is exclaiming, 'You don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am, and I know I do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The role made Papps a {{favourite}} {{with the}} viewers, won him many fans {{and made him}} famous. The Seven Network received fan mail for Papps before the series even debuted. While interviewed in 1989, Papps explained {{that he would never}} admit to being the [...] "sex symbol" [...] that he was labelled as. He thought it was [...] "nice to be loved and accepted" [...] but the fame the role generated became an [...] "intrusion" [...] on his privacy. He told TVTimes Power that he could not relate to the perception of him and added [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am and I'm not the person hyped out there".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, it is a [...] "mutating, episodic dance-floor track, [...] {{the singer}} {{presents}} {{herself as the}} goddess of love in the 'seashell bikini' painted by Botticelli [...] ". The lyrics of [...] "Venus" [...] are space-themed, name-checking the planets in the Solar System, with references to the planet's mythical counterpart, Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. The extraterrestrial themes drew comparisons to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] (2011) in the Entertainment Weekly review of the track. John Walker from MTV News noted that [...] "During Gaga's futuristic ballroom emcee moment, where she channels something straight out of Paris Is Burning she utters the line 'Uranus!/ Don't you know my ass is famous!?' That's like, the greatest version of 'Don't You <b>Know</b> <b>Who</b> <b>I</b> Am!?' that we've ever heard." ...|$|E

Rihanna's vocals on the song sound similar to the vocals by Justin Timberlake on his 2002 single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] (Justified, 2002). Lyrically, in [...] "Jump" [...] Rihanna preaches to her former partner that she won't be chasing him. Jude Rodgers of The Guardian {{described}} it as a [...] "see sex wriggling everywhere". In the song, the singer sings [...] "Skrillex-worthy" [...] lines, [...] "You think I give a damn/ but you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am/ I don't go around chasing no dude". The chorus features Rihanna singing, [...] "If you want it, let's do it/ Ridin' my pony/ My saddle is waitin'/ Come and jump on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was and I {{was trying to figure out}} who to do. I now am way more comfortable in my own skin." [...] The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album, including Diane Warren, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on {{a two-month}} {{retrospective}} of over 40 of Grant's films. In 1982, he was honored with the [...] "Man of the Year" [...] award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He turned 80 in 1984; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a [...] "serenity" [...] had come over the actor. Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year. In {{the last few years}} of his life, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show, A Conversation with Cary Grant, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years, from New Jersey to Texas, and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time. Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were [...] "ego-fodder", remarking that [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am inside and outside, but it's nice to have the outside, at least, substantiated".|$|E
500|$|She went {{to drive}} the No. 99 Ford Thunderbird, owned by the poorly-funded Colburn Racing team for the 1995 season, and planned to run five races in the Winston Cup Series along with a full season in the Busch Series. Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark. She declined an offer to test at Daytona International Speedway while {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. Shortly before the birth of her two children, Robinson started her interior-decorating business from her home, and painted murals for homes and businesses. She said of her decision to have children: [...] "Racing is part of who I am, If I became a different person because I had kids, then the kids were not going to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was my whole life before them." ...|$|E

[...] Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as [...] "the holy Gustav Mahler"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called him [...] "one of the towering musical figures of his day," [...] but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to [...] "two hours and forty minutes." [...] In London, The Times obituary said his conducting was [...] "more accomplished than that of any man save Richter," [...] and that his symphonies were [...] "undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality," [...] though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.|$|E

On February 19, he devoted {{most of the}} session to the non-album single [...] "Kentucky Rain", {{one of the few}} Hill & Range songs used on the American Sound recordings. Presley followed with a recording of [...] "Only the Strong Survive", a hit for Jerry Butler the previous year, which took twenty-nine takes. On February 20, he recorded Johnny Tillotson's [...] "It Keeps Right on a Hurtin'" [...] in three takes and [...] "Any Day Now" [...] in six. Presley's final session was on February 22, when he recorded vocal overdubs for [...] "True Love Travels on a Gravel Road" [...] and [...] "Power of My Love" [...] and vocals for several non-album cuts. The following month, Mike Leech and Green Spreen began work on the string and horn overdubs to finish the album; several brass overdubs were recorded by The Memphis Horns.|$|E
500|$|After the Magical Mystery Tour recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney {{to shoot}} [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] promotional film, {{although}} McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like {{we were going to get}} thrown in jail.

[...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E
