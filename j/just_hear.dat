5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E

Deen {{included}} the scene where Babe deliberately burns Abi in her list of [...] "12 times soaps were scarier than any horror movie". She described the moment as [...] "chilling", writing, [...] "The fact that the grim moment isn't seen (you <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> Abi's anguished scream) makes it even more terrifying." [...] In a separate article, Deen also praised the scene where Babe forced her way into Abi's house and said, [...] "the way she says 'watch your back' makes our blood run cold." [...] In 2017, Lindsay opined that Babe should receive her comeuppance and that Abi [...] "needs to be instrumental" [...] in this.|$|E

[...] "Jar of Hearts" [...] was praised by Mullins as an [...] "absolutely beautiful performance", and Fallon {{said it was}} [...] "haunting and filmed gorgeously". Kubicek wrote, [...] "it's nice to <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> her sing a song", and also stated that the two songs Rachel sang in the episode were [...] "two of [...] favorite songs from the entire season". Benigno gave it a [...] "B", his lowest grade of the night, and asked the show to [...] "stop doing these numbers": [...] "We get it. She's in pain and she can sing. Move on." [...] He gave [...] "I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You" [...] an [...] "A", and questioned why it had taken so long for Criss to receive numbers independent of the Warblers. Kubicek wrote that it was [...] "Blaine doing what Blaine does best: fun bubblegum pop", but Gonzalez was surprised {{that she did not}} love it and gave it a [...] "B", as she [...] "really missed the backing of Blaine's Warbler cohorts." ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross {{stated that}} the song {{was one of his}} {{favorites}} featured on Mastermind. He said, [...] "'Sanctified' was most definitely one of the favorites. It's because how much time—Just watching Kanye put into this because it actually started as a sample. We did the sample maybe 10 different ways and then we ultimately went with a beautiful lady out of Miami, Ms. Betty Wright. She blessed us. So, <b>just</b> <b>hearing</b> that chorus. <b>Just</b> <b>hearing</b> the way it came out. All the time we put in it. It most definitely was dope." [...] Then after Ross' sixth studio album Mastermind was released for free streaming on iTunes, the full version of [...] "Sanctified" [...] was released.|$|R

500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> one voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on [...] "When You Sleep" [...] were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take. Shields commented that [...] "The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in. (It had been sung 12 or 13 times)." [...] He explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Dialogue {{excerpts}} from pornographic films appear on multiple tracks. On the Bulk Recordings {{edition of the}} album, [...] "halfsharkalligatorhalfman" [...] is preceded by {{an excerpt from the}} comedy film Cabin Boy. Lily Moayeri of Rolling Stone called the album a [...] "psychedelic hip-hop concept album." [...] Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote that the album [...] "shed some light on the burgeoning turntablist revival via the scratching fireworks of DJ Q-Bert" [...] and its [...] "futuristic, horror-soundtrack production seemed {{to bridge the gap between}} hip-hop and the more electronic-oriented trip-hop". Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews also praised its sound, writing that [...] "Cuts are provided with infinite skill and precision by DJ Q-Bert" [...] and that the DJ Shadow/Automator remix of [...] "Waiting List" [...] is [...] "so good that you could hardly miss the original, if indeed there was one." [...] An instrumental version of the album was released in 1996 under the title Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats). Kembrew McLeod of Allmusic wrote of the instrumental album, stating [...] "If any other artist released an album such as this it would be considered throwaway trash—something for the hardcore fans. But Dan the Automator's backing tracks are so fresh and original, it's actually nice to <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> the beats minus the rhymes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you.

2500|$|Although {{he rejects}} the label, Maus is {{recognized}} as a progenitor of the hypnagogic pop scene, a genre noted for its reliance on memory and nostalgia. His compositions tend to employ the use of particular modal scales previously associated with Renaissance and Medieval music, which he believes is often mistaken {{as an attempt to}} evoke the 1980s. He explains that [...] "I'm not trying to evoke that time, I <b>just</b> <b>hear</b> that sound and it seems to suit this time right now. ... People associate the kind of harmonies that associate from the modes with the 80s sound, and for me it's not about the 80s, it's about what I think the kind of harmony is that arises from these modes - what I'm interested in." [...] He adds: [...] "For whatever reason, the pioneers of electronic music that came out of Sheffield and Manchester in the 1980s became interested in these ecclesiastical modes that, historically, were associated with the divine. ... The palette was there in the 80s so why was it set aside and forgotten? That thread can be taken up again." [...] He goes on to opine that synthesizers and waveforms offer more [...] "color and possibility" [...] than the guitar, which he feels is an [...] "exhausted" [...] instrument.|$|E
