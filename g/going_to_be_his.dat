5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown {{many times in the}} past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E

25|$|On {{the stage}} to Geneva the frigid weather and several {{mechanical}} issues bore down on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second {{for the last two}} years). It appeared that this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first to win the Tour de France without winning a stage.|$|E
25|$|Scully {{decided to}} leave CBS {{in favor of a}} job calling {{baseball}} games for NBC (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence (according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil, in the book The Game Behind the Game). CBS decided going into the 1981 NFL season that John Madden, whom CBS had hired in 1979 and who had called games alongside Frank Glieber and Gary Bender his first two years, {{was going to be the}} star color commentator of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring out who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS' lead play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since 1975, and was calling games alongside the former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, who had been promoted from CBS' number three broadcast team alongside Curt Gowdy.|$|E

25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E
500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you {{knew he was going to}} get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> catchphrase." ...|$|E

I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for.
