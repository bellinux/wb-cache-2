5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents occurred after Automatic Train Control was installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> on sentry duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together, suggesting that they had colluded).|$|E
40|$|Summary-Normal {{sleepers}} {{were instructed}} either to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> {{as quickly as}} they could or to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> whenever they desired, under a high mental load (listening to John Philip Sousa marches) or a low mental load (listening to sleep-conducive new age music). Under low load, participants trying to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> quickly did so faster than those attempting only to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> whenever they desired. Under high load, however, and consistent with the ironic process theory of mental control (Wegner, D. M [...] 1994, Psychological Review, 101, 34 - 52), sleep onset latency was greater for participants attempting to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> quickly than for those not attempting to do so.

5|$|Children with AS {{are more}} likely to have sleep problems, {{including}} difficulty in <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. AS is also associated with high levels of alexithymia, which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions. Although AS, lower sleep quality, and alexithymia are associated, their causal relationship is unclear.|$|E

5|$|Exercise is an {{activity}} that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep {{than those who do}} not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana.

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E

50|$|A person, then, who fears (i.e. {{experiences}} anticipatory anxiety over) {{not getting}} a good night's sleep may try too hard (that is, hyper-intend) to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> and this would hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in an acceptable amount of time.|$|R

5|$|After <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> that night, Sam is {{visited in}} a dream by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E

5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} {{wake up to}} pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that he {{is going}} to propose to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the Disneys {{moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E
5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising or setting of the sun, staring at anything red, or <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> at sunset.|$|E
