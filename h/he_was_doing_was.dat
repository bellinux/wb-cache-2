500|$|Insanity in English {{law is a}} defence to {{criminal}} charges {{based on the idea}} that the defendant was unable to understand what he was doing, or, that he was unable to understand that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E
500|$|He {{has worked}} as a concept {{designer}} on films, including Watchmen, Star Trek, , Cloverfield, and Avatar. Cloverfield director Matt Reeves noted they hired Page to design the [...] "creature" [...] that appears in the film, commenting, [...] "We would go into his office and he would have what I affectionately referred to as his 'Wall of Terror.' On the wall were all sorts of bits of color, and as you got closer suddenly your interest turned to revulsion because those pictures were like pictures of intestines and eyeballs and pieces of animals. What <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> having a biological, evolutionary basis for every aspect of the creature." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{insisted on}} {{complete}} attention at all times: [...] "Anyone who acts without {{paying attention to}} what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wasting his life. I'd {{go so far as to}} say that life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece." ...|$|R
50|$|Gobernador General - The highest-ranking {{official}} in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, this unnamed character pretends that what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> {{for the good of}} the Indios, the local citizens of the country, but in reality, he prioritizes the needs of his fellow Spaniards living in the country.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} of John Marston {{was developed to}} be a [...] "family man". The team developed him as a nuanced character, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience. Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. [...] "He was a man about things," [...] Wiethoff remarked. Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism. Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were [...] "wrong", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life. He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. [...] "I don't know if he knew that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong or not," [...] Wiethoff said.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, he is likely to be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion as to what to do.|$|E
500|$|Donen is {{credited}} with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals [...] such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley [...] were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers {{were part of a}} stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch... What we did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal." [...] Film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical [...] "outshines anybody else's, including Vincente Minnelli's." [...] He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
50|$|This {{would later}} {{resurface}} in a joke in the Season 5 story arc involving the Bumbling Brothers Circus, {{in which an}} Indian has Rocky tied to a stake and plans to set fire to it. Rocky interjects that the network says what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong. However, the Indian claim that they are merely 'roasting' Rocky, and that makes the situation ok.|$|R

25|$|The {{children}} {{find out}} that in Constance’s time they kill seals for their oil. They become angered by this because this is why there are none left in their time. The children try to persuade a seal trapper that what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and to stop what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided {{the only way to}} save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|R
500|$|California {{used the}} M'Naghten {{standard}} for sanity which held {{that for a}} defendant to [...] "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of}} the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts were wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the co-eds because he wanted them [...] "for myself, like possessions," [...] and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind.|$|E
500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, {{that he did not know}} what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of Automatism where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong".|$|E
50|$|Alcoholism {{is another}} tool Hukum Chand uses {{in attempt to}} clean his conscience. He feels the guilt of his actions by day and {{relieved}} of them by night, when his alcohol is able to justify trysts with a teenage prostitute {{the same age as}} his deceased daughter. In all his conflictions, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> able to acknowledge that what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> bad, but is still unable to promote good.|$|R
2500|$|... "The little picture which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> of a Madonna seated as if {{she were}} about to spin yarn. The Child has placed his foot on the basket of yarns and has grasped the yarn-winder and gazes attentively at four spokes that are {{in the form of a}} cross. As if desirous of the cross he smiles and holds it firm, and is unwilling to yield it to his Mother who seems to want to takeit away from him." ...|$|R
50|$|In the ABC's 64-Page Giant, Splash battles Bunko the Dog (a {{parody of}} Bimbo, Betty Boop's canine boyfriend), a 1930s cartoon {{character}} who {{is brought to}} life in a movie theatre. Accused of plagiarism, Splash is nearly defeated until he tells Bunko what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> in fact a tribute. As he and his companion leave the theatre they encounter {{what appears to be}} DC Comic's Plastic Man. This story has Moore acknowledging the inspirations behind Splash, as well as displaying self-depreciating humour (i.e. that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in fact merely copying earlier works).|$|R
2500|$|Alcala made no {{significant}} attempt to dispute the four added charges, {{other than to}} assert {{that he could not}} remember killing any of the women. As part of his closing argument, he played the Arlo Guthrie song [...] "Alice's Restaurant" [...] in which the protagonist tells a psychiatrist that he wants to [...] "kill". After less than two days' deliberation the jury convicted him on all five counts of first-degree murder. A surprise witness during the penalty phase of the trial was Tali Shapiro, Alcala's first known victim. Psychiatrist Richard Rappaport, the only defense witness, testified that Alcala's borderline personality disorder could explain his testimony that he had no memory of committing the murders. The prosecutor argued that Alcala was a [...] "sexual predator" [...] who [...] "knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong and didn't care". In March 2010 Alcala was sentenced to death for a third time.|$|E
2500|$|Australian Jewish News {{credited}} NZ MP Taito Phillip Field, a Jewish-Samoan political novice, {{of acting}} as {{a bridge between the}} two governments when he visited Nissan Krupsky, the former Israeli ambassador to New Zealand, in Israel in December. AJN reported that Field met with Israel's Foreign Ministry officials secretly because of the NZ ban on meetings between the government's officials. New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff denied Field played any significant role in overcoming the diplomatic impasse on 1 July. [...] "It wasn't a high-level visit. What <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> in a private capacity to see people he knew in Israel and I didn't raise any objection to him going." [...] According to AJN, [...] "While Field's visit eventually turned out to have critical diplomatic significance, it was described as private {{so as not to be}} seen as violating the sanctions imposed by Clark. Nonetheless, throughout his visit Field served as middleman between the two Governments, maintaining phone contacts with Wellington in order to secure Clark's approval for the start of the Ankara talks." [...] Foreign Minister Goff denied that the talks between Israel's FM official Michael Ronen and Ambassador Henderson were a direct result of Field's visit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{judges were}} {{specifically}} asked {{if a person}} could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, [...] "he {{must be considered in}} the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real". This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows Hadfield's Trial, above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. In R v Bell 1984 Crim. LR 685 the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because [...] "It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it" [...] as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, {{and the fact that he}} believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong in the legal sense.|$|E
40|$|On Pain of Death is {{a fictional}} retelling {{of the story}} of Sir Pelleas, who, in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte D’Arthur, is {{depicted}} as a noble knight with unrequited love for Lady Ettarde. He follows her for weeks, repeatedly declaring his love for her, despite her clear rejections. In rewriting this story, I hope {{to draw attention to the}} fact that, by today’s standards, what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> clear-cut stalking. By introducing a character with a periphery perspective, I hope to call into question how “romantic” these stories of unrequited love really are...|$|R
50|$|Agreeing to her request, Kyo {{is drawn}} {{into a world of}} {{fighting}} giant robots in a game-like world that he must save from Deutera Areas formed by aliens known as Gards-orm that threaten to destroy the earth. However, Kyo soon comes to realize that the world that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> living in might not even be real at all and begins to find that everything <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> strangely familiar. As <b>he</b> questions the nature of the reality he lives in, Kyo must continue to fight {{in order to protect the}} lives of those important to him.|$|R

6000|$|... "They used to be," [...] {{replied the}} office boy, [...] "but {{once or twice}} they had some pretty warm talks. This young feller didn't {{like it at all}} the way his uncle treated your father. I heard him tell his uncle once, that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> close to swindling.

50|$|The real {{circumstances}} of his death - lying in bed with pneumonia, without anyone checking to see how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> - <b>were</b> perhaps, and regrettably more fitting to an artist, {{but not to the}} figure they knew.|$|R
50|$|Far {{from being}} an act {{resulting}} from mental disorder, there is contemporary evidence that he knew full well what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> Books <b>were</b> discovered {{at the scene of}} his death laid open at specific places for the benefit of close friends.|$|R

It is subsequently revealed that Gabriel has stolen the American Son armor, but is now suffering from a split personality, committing crimes as himself while American Son undoes the damage he has caused, identifying itself as the part of Gabriel that recognizes that what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong.|$|R
60|$|But {{though he}} tried to persuade himself that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was,</b> under the circumstances, a favor to his parents, {{there was a big}} lump in his throat. as he did his work that night, and {{realized}} that in a few hours neither his father nor his mother would know where he was. He was more than usually careful about the kindling-wood and the water, and when his mother spoke to him so kindly, he had the greatest difficulty in keeping his secret.|$|E
6000|$|He {{left the}} red car {{two blocks away}} and arrived on foot at the pretty, three-storied, {{shingled}} Berkeley house. For an instant only, {{he was aware of}} an inward hesitancy, but the next moment he rang the bell. He knew that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> in direct violation of her wishes, and that he was setting her a difficult task to receive as a Sunday caller the multimillionaire and notorious Elam Harnish of newspaper fame. On the other hand, the one thing he did not expect of her was what he would have termed [...] "silly female capers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call it {{so if you}} will; but, Arabin, no preaching {{of yours}} can alter it. It {{is all that is}} left to me of my manliness. That poor broken reed who is lying there sick,--who has sacrificed all the world to her love for me,--who is the mother of my children, and the partner of my sorrows and the wife of my bosom,--even she cannot change me in this, though she pleads with the eloquence of all her wants. Not even for her can I hold out my hand for a dole."
