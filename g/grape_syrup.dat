5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; <b>grape</b> <b>syrup</b> mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E

25|$|The often coarse and {{unrefined}} {{taste of}} ancient wine was adjusted {{to make it}} more drinkable. Spices were added directly to the wine to improve the aroma, and other ingredients, such as honey, pepper, herbs and even lime, resin or seawater were added to improve the flavor or disguise a poor-tasting wine. Wine was also sweetened by the addition of <b>grape</b> juice <b>syrup.</b> Wine was also sometimes given an aroma by rubbing the winepress with wood resin. On the other hand, wine could also be added to drinking water to improve the taste, especially {{towards the end of the}} summer when rainwater had been standing in a cistern for at least six months. This also had the beneficial effect of lowering the bacteria content of the water.|$|R

40|$|The {{story of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years BC. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has been always considered a “poor” component: {{it is not a}} “food”, it doesn’t have high nutritional values, and it is produced by transformation of other more nutritive rich fermented foods. Vinegar is a condiment, but also a preservative and, in some countries, a healthy drink. It can be made by a two step fermentation of yeasts followed by acetic acid bacteria from almost any fermentable carbohydrate source: apples, pears, <b>grapes,</b> honey, <b>syrups,</b> cereals, hydrolysed starches, beer, and wine are all ideal substrates for the production of vinegar. Since vinegars is, with few exceptions, an inexpensive commodity, its production requires a low-cost raw material, such as sub-standard fruits, seasonal agricultural surpluses, various food processing by-products and fruit waste. However there are vinegars, so called spirit vinegars, obtained directly by acetic oxidation of alcohol obtained from distillation of fermented mashes or, in some countries, petrolchemical ethanol. Some western by-products of wood carbonization obtained by distillation of pyroligneous liquor collected during wood pyrolisis, are called “vinegar” and they are used as agricultural material, animal health product, cosmetic ingredients and folk drug in Japan and Est-Asia (Mu et al., 2003; Mu et al., 2006). These distilled solutions have not be considered as vinegar because no fermentative process occurs in their production. Other specialty vinegars are grouped as herbal or fruit vinegars. In this cases the name “X vinegar” doesn’t indicate the raw materials used in vinegar fermentation but the flavours added to obtain specific taste and characteristic sensorial features. Herbal vinegars consist of wine vinegars or white distilled vinegars, which may be seasoned with garlic, basil, tarragon, cinnamon, clove, or nutmeg. Fruit-flavoured vinegars are wine and white vinegars sweetened with fruit or fruit juice to produce a characteristic sweet-sour taste. Traditional vinegars are very expensive vinegar produced from regional foods according to well-established customs: balsamic vinegar of Modena from Italy; Sherry vinegar from Spain; Champagne vinegar from France etc. According to international definition of vinegar, in this book we considered only vinegar derived from a two stage fermentation process. However with many of the vinegars in Africa, Asia and Latin America, knowledge of the processes involved is poor and a comprehensive view of all different kinds of vinegars is impossible. Therefore {{it is likely that the}} worldspread vinegars give a very greater picture. Economy, technology and law about vinegar were described in this chapter...|$|R
