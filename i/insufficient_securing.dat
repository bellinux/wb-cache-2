40|$|Abstrakt The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of {{securing}} serviceability of decontamination sites using the forces and the means available after cancellation of rescue battalions, and on the current position of the Fire Rescue Service. The objective of the thesis was {{to draw attention to the}} problem arising from <b>insufficient</b> <b>securing</b> of decontamination after cancellation of the rescue battalions intended for this activity. The output of the analysis of the present state and the state before cancellation of the rescue batallions is the finding that the solution currently used to secure decontamination is less effective. Therefore I have proposed a more effective solution based on maintaining rescue battalions together with the Fire Rescue Service. The raised hypotheses were confirmed through the concise charts that addressed the capabilities of the rescue units and the communication between individual brigades and departments will be verified in the planned exercise ZÓNA 2010 that will take place from 22 to 23 September 2010. In my thesis I made use of the available literature, findings from my bachelor thesis and from exercises ZÓNA 2007 and ZÓNA 2008, observations of experts, and terrain reconnaissance leading to proposing a suitable decontamination site. The thesis includes a proposal of a decontamination site in Hluboká nad Vltavou { [...] } Zámostí. I believe that there would be justification for submission of this proposal to the competent bodies. I regard my thesis as a good material for assessing the current state of this issue, proposing various solutions, and returning to greater care of citizens, as it used to be in previous year...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate persistence of gentamicin residues in milk after the intramammary treatment of lactating cows for mastitis. Milk samples were collected at a 1 -d interval after the last administration from 34 individual cows that had received intramammary infusions of gentamicin. The doses and treatment times evaluated in this study represented those that have been applied by veterinarians in practice. The tetrazolium chloride assay was used to determine whether there were significant residues of the antibiotic in the samples. Persistence of detectable drug residues in milk from 33 cows (28 cows, ≤ 6 infusions at ≤ 0. 7 g gentamicin; and 5 cows, 2 infusions at 0. 8 g gentamicin) did not exceed 5 d; but 1 cow (5 infusions at 0. 8 g gentamicin) had detectable residues in its milk for 9 d.

40|$|Objective: To explore whether {{integrated}} {{structures are}} associated with more integrated and differentiated forms of care management in mental health services. Method: Cross-sectional postal survey of care management arrangements in local authority social services departments in England (n = 101) and health and social services Trusts in Northern Ireland (NI) (n = 11). Results: Some, but not all, indicators showed more evidence of integrated practice in NI mental health and social services. This included: greater involvement of health care staff in care management; greater multidisciplinary working and a more integrated approach to assessment and care planning processes; a more differentiated approach to care management, including greater targeting of care management resources; a closer link between care management and specialist provision; and overall more integrated practice. Conclusions: This study concurs with previous research showing that structurally integrated health and social services in NI are more conducive towards, although <b>insufficient</b> to <b>secure,</b> integrated working. As the nature, type of services and ways of working appear to be broadly similar in England and NI, this may imply that greater structural integration per se may not lead to better service outcomes...|$|R

Our findings suggest that strong, local, durable networks are crucial to enabling scholars’ participation in transnational networks, which support their publishing in both English and local languages. Findings contribute directly to our understandings about academic publishing in a global context and to broader debates about the efficacy of initiatives for increasing research collaboration such as those sponsored by the EU Framework Programmes.

Network security visualization allows the display and projection of the network or system data, in hope to efficiently monitor and protect the system from any intrusions or possible attacks.

This study assesses different stakeholders' views on the acceptability of waiting lists in health care, their preferences for priority care of patients, and their judgements on acceptable waiting times for surgical patients. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted among 257 former patients (82 with varicose veins, 86 with inguinal hernia, and 89 with gallstones), 101 surgeons, 95 occupational physicians, and 65 GPs. Judgements on acceptable waiting times were assessed using vignettes of patients with varicose veins, inguinal hernia, and gallstones. Results Participants endorsed the prioritisation of patients based on clinical need, but not on ability to benefit. The groups had significantly different opinions (p Acceptable waiting times ranged between 2 and 25 weeks {{depending on the type}} of disorder (p Conclusion The explicit prioritisation of patients seems an accepted means for reducing the overall burden from waiting lists. The disagreement about appropriate prioritisation criteria and the need for uniformity, however, raises concern about equity when implementing prioritisation in daily practice. Single factor waiting time thresholds seem <b>insufficient</b> for <b>securing</b> timely care provision in the presence of long waiting lists as they do not account for the different consequences of waiting between patients. </p...|$|R
30|$|Dental {{avulsion}} implies {{total displacement}} of the tooth out of its socket. Avulsion of teeth occurs most often in children from 7 to 9  years of age, when the permanent incisors are erupting (Andreasen 1970). Various statistics have shown that avulsion of teeth following traumatic injuries is infrequent ranging from 0.5 to 3  % of traumatic injuries in the permanent dentition (Andreasen 1970). Histologic examination of replanted human and animal teeth has revealed four different healing modalities in the periodontal ligament (PDL): (1) healing with a normal PDL, (2) healing with surface resorption (healing-related resorption), (3) healing with ankylosis (replacement resorption), (4) healing with inflammatory resorption (Andreasen and Andreasen 1992). A normal PDL formation after tooth replantation is difficult to achieve in clinical situations, because the injury results in a minimum lesion in the internal layer of the PDL. The use of substances such as enamel matrix derivative (Emdogain) and Vitamin C for root surface treatment applied before replantation reduced the root resorption not ensuring PDL regeneration (Barrett et al. 2005; Panzarini et al. 2008). Emdogain and low level laser therapies {{were found to be}} <b>insufficient</b> to <b>secure</b> an improved PDL regeneration after replantation of tooth (Barrett et al. 2005; Saito et al. 2011). Therefore, there is a need of new therapeutic strategies to enhance PDL regeneration in avulsion cases.|$|R

40|$|Marine {{reserves}} {{are places where}} wildlife and habitats are protected from extractive and depositional uses of the sea. Although {{considered to be the}} pinnacle in marine conservation, many permit non-consumptive activities with little or no regulation. This paper examines the potential impacts of 16 non-consumptive activities including scuba diving, sailing, scientific research and motor boating, and how they might compromise the conservation objectives of marine reserves. Examination of 91 marine reserves from 36 countries found little agreement or consistency in what non-consumptive activities are permitted in marine reserves and how they are regulated. The two most common activities allowed without regulation were swimming (mentioned in 80 % of marine reserves and allowed in 63 % of these) and kayaking (mentioned in 85 %, allowed in 53 %). Scuba diving was mentioned in 91 % and allowed without regulation in 41 %. A risk score for the likely level of threat to wildlife and/or habitats that each activity could produce was then assigned based on effects reported in the literature. The risk analysis suggests that motor boating and activities which include or require it have a high potential to negatively impact wildlife and habitats if inadequately managed. Hence protection against extractive or depositional activities alone is <b>insufficient</b> to <b>secure</b> the high standard of protection usually assumed in marine reserves. For this to be achieved activities typically considered as benign must receive appropriate management, especially with increasing recreational use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Database {{security}} {{has become a}} vital issue in modern Web applications. Critical business data in databases is an evident target for attack. Therefore, ensuring the confidentiality, privacy and integrity of data is a major issue {{for the security of}} database systems. Recent high profile data thefts have shown that perimeter defenses are <b>insufficient</b> to <b>secure</b> sensitive data. Encryption is a well established technology for protecting sensitive data, but developing a database encryption strategy must take many factors into consideration. In the case of semitrusted databases where the database contents are shared between many parties, using server-based encryption (server encrypts all data) or client-based encryption (client encrypts all data) is not sufficient to protect semi-trusted databases. This paper presents a practical implementation of field level encryption in the semi-trusted database system by encrypting database content in a mixed form. Our solution is called Mixed Cryptography Database (MCDB), which is based on a columnbased data classification. In this paper, we evaluate the validity and effectiveness of the mixed encryption architecture over the semi trusted database. Also, we make a comparison for query processing performance between our proposed framework, clientbased, server-based encryption approaches and plaintext database. The proposed framework is very useful in strengthening the protection of sensitive data even if the database server is attacked at multiple points from the inside or outside with additional performance cost in the query processing.
