It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point). In general, a system of linear equations may behave differently from expected if the equations are linearly dependent, or if {{two or more of}} the equations are inconsistent.|$|E
25|$|Megazostrodon is {{the only}} {{well-known}} genus of the family Megazostrodontidae. The other members of this family that are currently known to science are Indozostrodon, Dinnetherium, Wareolestes and Brachyzostrodon. The megazostrodontids used to be classified {{as members of a}} group of mammals called the Triconodonts, which are thought to have evolved from a specific group of reptiles (the cynodonts or 'mammal-like reptiles’) during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods. However, recent classifications consider the megazostrodontids to be mammaliaforms just outside the Mammalia proper, while the triconodonts remain in the (crowngroup) Mammalia. One must <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distinction between true mammals and mammaliaformes is purely a cladistic and phylogenetic one: mammaliaforms are mammals in every other way.|$|E

25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E

2500|$|The report {{commissioned}} from Atkins Global by Rochdale council, {{at a cost}} of £80,000, {{was published}} in July 2006 and claimed that previous tests on the land, carried out on behalf of the developers, were not thorough enough, and that extensive work would be required before councillors should even consider the controversial planning application. Atkins Global also claimed {{that the majority of the}} developers' tests did not detect the true levels of asbestos in the soil. The report concluded that [...] "the presence of asbestos cannot be ruled out across much of the site." [...] In June 2007, Countryside Properties withdrew from the joint planning application. MMC released a statement saying: [...] "Countryside Properties Ltd has withdrawn from the planning application for a mixed use scheme on the former Turner Brothers site because they became disillusioned with the apparent unwillingness of the town planning department to deal with the application as a result of the ill-founded and negative publicity generated by Jason Addy's campaign. The people of Rochdale should <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site owners have not caused the contamination problems on the site. This was inherited from Federal Mogul... If we were to cave in to Jason Addy's uninformed scaremongering and let him have his way, which we most certainly won't, the site would remain a contaminated eyesore on the face of Rochdale in eternity, and all the surrounding houses and properties will be devalued by his badly thought out obsession." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} given {{generally}} favorable reviews, receiving around an 82.68% on GameRankings. [...] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{commented on the}} game's sound, graphics and originality and gave it an 8.4, stating, [...] "While the game isn't a strict sequel, it does {{take place in the}} same universe, with the same graphics style and nearly identical gameplay. ... he additional levels, the two-player option, and the inclusion of the Parappa remixes in Um Jammer Lammy add a value that Parappa the Rapper simply can't touch. But <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game doesn't stray far from the formula, and the game's difficulty will put off those who never mastered Parappa. So, to put it another way, if you didn't play Parappa to death and love every minute of it, you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy." [...] Similarly, IGN gave it an 8.6 and commented on the gameplay, story, graphics and sound, stating, [...] "If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. ... But the rest of the game is sweet. ... Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos... has so much more that Parappa didn't have." [...] Game Revolution also gave it a B, calling it [...] "a cool game, {{if for no other reason}} than to entertain sufficiently inebriated party guests. It's easily the most insane mish-mash of psychadelia [...] yet seen on a console, and at least deserves a shot (or the whole bottle, even)", but criticized the story, calling it [...] "the most obtuse, disjointed, drug-induced mess of a story that has ever been conceived, period."
