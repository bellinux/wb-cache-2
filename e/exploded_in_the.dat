5|$|Automobile {{production}} <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and {{in other}} nations during the 1920s. This, and {{the increasing use of}} petroleum derivatives to power factories and industrial equipment, substantially increased worldwide demand for oil.|$|E
5|$|Many shells <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees, sending {{shards of}} steel and wood into the ground, but the men were {{protected}} by their reinforced foxholes. The German guns cut deep holes the size of trucks in the pasture.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deep South, and along with it, the slave population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York and Boston and most American cities had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Witnesses {{reported}} seeing [...] "half a bus {{flying through the}} air". BBC Radio 5 Live and The Sun later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bus.|$|R

50|$|A Thousand Stars <b>Explode</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sky is a play collaboratively {{written by}} David Eldridge, Robert Holman and Simon Stephens. It premiered at the Lyric Hammersmith on 7 May 2010 and ran until 5 June 2010.|$|R
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gardens.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing {{cartoons}} and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, {{he was wounded}} in the left thigh when a shell <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.|$|E
5|$|During the Hurricane Rita evacuation, a bus {{filled with}} {{residents}} from Brighton Gardens, {{a nursing home}} in Bellaire, caught on fire and <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Wilmer. The September 23, 2005, explosion killed 24 {{people out of the}} 38 residents and employees in the bus. The resulting lawsuit was settled in June 2009. On March 23, 2008, a tour bus carrying Tejano singer Emilio Navaira crashed in Bellaire. By 2008, an increasing number of houses sold for over $1,000,000.|$|E
50|$|Another missile was {{launched}} {{on the afternoon}} of December 6 and followed a similar pattern, crashing and <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea less than twenty feet from the island's cliffs. The wreckage did not yield an explanation for the failure, but the parachute system was suspected.|$|R

2500|$|... 24 April: a [...] IRA van-bomb {{failed to}} <b>explode</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Turf Lodge area of Belfast. Despite a warning from the IRA {{that there was}} a primed and unexploded bomb on a main road the RUC refused to close the street and only responded to the {{incident}} 13hours later.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, {{switchgear}} <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station could not take the extra load and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption of work and services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 megawatts of electricity.|$|E

50|$|Direct Atlas {{descendants}} were {{continued to}} be used as satellite launch vehicles into the 21st century. An Atlas rocket is shown <b>exploding,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1983 art film Koyaanisqatsi, directed by Godfrey Reggio, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penultimate shot. <b>The</b> vehicle shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie was the first launch attempt of an Atlas-Centaur in May 1962.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the {{two ships}} made a {{daylight}} dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany. After reaching Kiel in early February, the ship went into drydock. On {{the night of}} 26 February, the British launched an air attack on the ship; one bomb penetrated her armored deck and <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forward ammunition magazine, causing serious damage {{and a large number}} of casualties. The repairs necessitated by the damage were so time-consuming that it was determined to rebuild the ship to accommodate the 38cm guns as originally intended. The 28cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries. In 1943, Hitler ordered the cessation of conversion work, and on 27 March 1945, she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in German-occupied Poland. She was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

Upon the reunion, fireworks appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, but they {{turn out to be}} ships <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sargaseous Sea, where the lighthouse beacon shines no more.|$|R
50|$|During {{the night}} on 11 May 1941, a large bomb went through five floors before <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart of the fully {{occupied}} hotel, killing 24 and with another 26 people seriously injured. The hotel was demolished and rebuilt as Agriculture House in 1954, and as 25 and 27 Knightsbridge in 1993-95.|$|R

5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille was {{involved}} in the numerous wars of religion fought between Protestant and Catholic factions with support from foreign allies {{during the second half of}} the 16th century. Religious and political tensions in Paris initially <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Day of the Barricades on 12 May 1588, when hard-line Catholics rose up in revolt against the relatively moderate Henry III. After a day's fighting had occurred across the capital, Henry III fled and the Bastille surrendered to Henry, the Duke of Guise and leader of the Catholic League, who appointed Bussy-Leclerc as his new captain. Henry III responded by having the Duke and his brother murdered later that year, whereupon Bussy-Leclerc used the Bastille as a base to mount a raid on the Parlement de Paris, arresting the president and other magistrates, whom he suspected of having royalist sympathies, and detaining them in the Bastille. They were not released until the intervention of Charles, the Duke of Mayenne, and the payment of substantial ransoms. Bussy-Leclerc remained in control of the Bastille until December 1592, when, following further political instability, he was forced to surrender the castle to Charles and flee the city.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 1918 a German Gotha {{aircraft}} dropped five bombs one {{of which}} destroyed {{the roof of the}} station's ornate booking hall and killed 20 people. The station was also bombed in World War II, including a land mine damaging the roof on 15–16 October 1940, and a bomb <b>exploding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beer vaults underneath Platform 3 on 10–11 May 1941.|$|R
