5|$|<b>Dissolved</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{in fresh}} water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of <b>dissolved</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek.

40|$|Ion {{exchange}} membranes {{have been}} used in microbial fuel cell (MFC) because it can prevent high oxygen permeability and the migration of substrate instead of protons from one chamber to another. Despite all these advantages the usage of this type of membrane suffers several operational problems such as high <b>dissolve</b> <b>oxygen</b> permeability, adverse deformation and proton conductivity which can affect the MFC performance. In order to overcome this problem, new membrane for microbial fuel cell system was fabricated using sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) and Cloisite 15 A®. The membranes were characterized based on their electrochemical and physical properties. The characteristics of the SPEEK nanocomposite membranes were then compared with the unmodified SPEEK membrane and the commercially available Nafion 117 membrane. Based on the result, SPEEK/Cloisite 15 A® contributed high energy generated across the load compare to SPEEK without additive and Nafion 117.
