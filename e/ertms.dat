40|$|This paper {{describes}} the computation {{and analysis of}} the Earth’s short-scale gravity field through high-resolution gravity forward modelling using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) global topography model. We use the established residual terrain modelling technique along with advanced computational resources and massive parallelisation to convert the high-pass filtered SRTM topography – complemented with bathymetric information in coastal zones – to implied short-scale gravity effects. The result is the <b>ERTM</b> 2160 model (Earth Residual Terrain Modelled-gravity field with the spatial scales equivalent to spherical-harmonic coefficients up to degree 2160 removed). <b>ERTM</b> 2160, used successfully for the construction of the GGMplus gravity maps, approximates the short-scale (i. e., ~ 10 km down to ~ 250 m) gravity field in terms of gravity disturbances, quasi/geoid heights and vertical deflections at ~ 3 billion gridded points within ± 60 latitude. <b>ERTM</b> 2160 reaches maximum values for the quasi/geoid height of ~ 30 cm, gravity disturbance in excess of 100 mGal, and vertical deflections of ~ 30 arc-seconds over the Himalaya mountains. Analysis of the <b>ERTM</b> 2160 field as a function of terrain roughness shows in good approximation a linear relationship between terrain roughness and gravity effects, with values of ~ 1. 7 cm (quasi/geoid heights), ~ 11 mGal (gravity disturbances) and 1. 5 arc-seconds (vertical deflections) signal strength per 100 m standard deviation of the terrain. These statistics can be used to assess the magnitude of omitted gravity signals over various types of terrain when using degree- 2160 gravity models such as EGM 2008. Applications for <b>ERTM</b> 2160 are outlined including its use in gravity smoothing procedures, augmentation of EGM 2008, fill-in for future ultra-high resolution gravity models in spherical harmonics, or calculation of localised or global power spectra of Earth’s short-scale gravity field. <b>ERTM</b> 2160 is freely available via [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{inversion}} {{and interpretation}} of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data from coarse blocky and ice-rich permafrost sites are challenging due to strong resistivity contrasts and high contact resistances. To assess temporal changes during ERT monitoring (<b>ERTM),</b> corresponding inversion artefacts have {{to be separated from}} true subsurface changes. Appraisal techniques serve to analyse an <b>ERTM</b> data set from a rockglacier, including synthetic modelling, the depth of investigation index technique and the so-called resolution matrix approach. The application of these methods led step by step to the identification of unreliable model regions and thus to the improvement in interpretation of temporal resistivity changes. An important result is that resistivity values of model regions with strong resistivity contrasts and highly resistive features are generally of critical reliability, and resistivity changes within or below the ice core of a rockglacier should therefore not be interpreted as a permafrost signal. Conversely, long-term degradation phenomena in terms of warming of massive ground ice at the permafrost table are detectable by <b>ERTM...</b>|$|R

40|$|The ice {{content of}} the {{subsurface}} {{is a major factor}} controlling the natural hazard potential of permafrost degradation in alpine terrain. Monitoring of changes in ground ice content is therefore similarly important as temperature monitoring in mountain permafrost. Although electrical resistivity tomography monitoring (<b>ERTM)</b> {{has proved to be a}} valuable tool for the observation of ground ice degradation, results are often ambiguous or contaminated by inversion artefacts. In theory, the P-wave velocity of seismic waves is similarly sensitive to phase changes between unfrozen water and ice. Provided that the general conditions (lithology, stratigraphy, state of weathering, pore space) remain unchanged over the observation period, temporal changes in the observed travel times of repeated seismic measurements should indicate changes in the ice and water content within the pores and fractures of the subsurface material. In this paper, the applicability of refraction seismic tomography monitoring (RSTM) as an independent and complementary method to <b>ERTM</b> is analysed for two test sites in the Swiss Alps. The development and validation of an appropriate RSTM approach involves a) the comparison of time-lapse seismograms and analysis of reproducibility of the seismic signal, b) the analysis of time-lapse travel time curves with respect to shifts in travel times and changes in P-wave velocities, and c) the comparison of inverted tomograms including the quantification of velocity changes. Results show a high potential of the RSTM approach concerning the detection of altered subsurface conditions caused by freezing and thawing processes. For velocity changes on the order of 3000 m/s even an unambiguous identification of significant ground ice loss is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{modification}} of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) nanoparticles synthesized {{in the presence}} of an ionic surfactant is critical to their application in biological fields for better solubility and biocompatibility. In this work, NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) was transformed from insoluble, inactive to hydrophilic, biocompatible via ligand exchange modification with polyacrylic acid (PAA). Ligand exchange was carried out at room temperature when a colloidal solution of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was treated with excess PAA. The PAA modified NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) nanoparticles got better surface properties but with declined inner up-conversion fluorescence. Generally, coating an analogous layer of material outside the core nanoparticles can improve the optical properties of the core. Accordingly, NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /NaYF 4 nanoparticles were synthesized before PAA modification to avoid the optical intensity decaying. The result of fluorescence test proved that the water soluble NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /NaYF 4 /PAA nanocomposites had a sound up-conversion property compared with that of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /PAA. Furthermore, the up-conversion fluorescence property of the nanocomposite varied with the doping ratio of <b>Er(Tm)</b> to Yb and the possible mechanism for this change was also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) –protein kinase B (PKB) pathway regulates {{survival}} and chemotherapy resistance of neuronal cells, and its deregulation in neuroblastoma (NB) tumors predicts an adverse clinical outcome. Here, {{we show that}} inhibition of PI 3 K-PKB signaling in human NB cells induces nuclear translocation of FOXO 3 /FKHRL 1, represses the prosurvival protein BIRC 5 /Survivin, and sensitizes to DNA-damaging agents. To specifically address whether FKHRL 1 contributes to Survivin regulation, we introduced a 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen-regulated FKHRL 1 (A 3) <b>ERtm</b> allele into NB cells. Conditional FKHRL 1 activation repressed Survivin transcription and protein expression. Transgenic Survivin exerted a significant antiapoptotic effect and prevented the accumulation of Bim and Bax at mitochondria, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential {{as well as the}} release of cytochrome c during FKHRL 1 -induced apoptosis. In concordance, Survivin knockdown by retroviral short hairpin RNA technology accelerated FKHRL 1 -induced apoptosis. Low-dose activation of FKHRL 1 sensitized to the DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin and etoposide, whereas the overexpression of Survivin diminished FKHRL 1 sensitization to these drugs. These results suggest that repression of Survivin by FKHRL 1 facilitates FKHRL 1 -induced apoptosis and sensitizes to cell death induced by DNA-damaging agents, which supports the central role of PI 3 K-PKB-FKHRL 1 signaling in drug resistance of human NB...|$|R

In a pipe transporting oil and gas, the slugs can be characterized by their sizes, occurring instants and frequencies.

Some measurements are also performed using high speed camera, thus making this effort multimodal. Due to the very much reduced estimation times involved in this process as compared to tomographic image processing, this tomometric method has many advantages in real time measurement and control applications. Signal processing of the volume ratio data of tomography systems and image analysis of high speed camera images can be done to extract various slug parameters. Slug length, velocity and frequency in a slightly inclined upward two phase water/air flow are estimated using fusion of data from the multimodal system.

40|$|MATRIPTASE MEDIATED c-MET SIGNALING IN CRITICAL FOR BREAST CANCER PROGRESSION by GINA ZORATTI Historically proteases {{have been}} {{associated}} with tumor progression and metastasis through degradation of the basement membrane. However, in recent years these enzymes have also been shown to play key roles in the activation of growth factors and cytokines, thereby activating pro-oncogenic signaling pathways. Matriptase (MT-SP 1, ST 14) is an epithelia-specific pericellular protease which has received considerable attention in recent years spurred by the consistent dysregulation of the protease in human epithelial tumors including breast cancer. We have performed both functional and mechanistic studies of matriptase in breast cancer using parallel, complementary in vitro and in vivo genetic 2 ̆ 2 loss-of-function 2 ̆ 2 strategies. To determine the contribution of matriptase to breast cancer in vivo we used matriptase hypomorhic mice with very low matriptase expression in the mammary gland. When crossed into the mammary tumor virus (MMTV) Polyomavirus middle T (PymT) mouse genetic mammary tumor model, matriptase hypomorphic mice displayed a significant decrease in tumor burden. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) /c-Met signaling pathway is dysregulated in breast cancer and has been causally linked to breast carcinogenesis. It has previously been shown that matriptase is an effective activator of the inactive pro-form of HGF. To investigate whether matriptase mediated pro-HGF activation and elicitation of the c-Met signaling pathway plays a critical role in breast cancer we isolated primary mammary carcinoma cells from conditional matriptase knock-out mice carrying the β-actin-Cre <b>ERTM</b> transgene. Upon brief exposure to tamoxifen, matriptase was efficiently genetically ablated allowing for comparative analysis of c-Met phosphorylation/activation in matriptase sufficient and deficient primary carcinoma cells. Addition of pro-HGF to matriptase sufficient cells resulted in robust activation of c-Met and the downstream targets Gab 1 and Akt. In contrast, matriptase ablation led to a greatly reduced level of c-Met pathway activation. Parallel experiments using RNA silencing of matriptase in four different human breast cancer cell lines similarly demonstrated abrogation of c-Met signaling upon pro-HGF stimulation. 	This abrogation of the c-Met signaling pathway affects the breast cancer cells proliferation rate as well as their invasiveness as demonstrated in 3 D culture. Our results suggest that matriptase is critically involved in pro-HGF activation leading to downstream signaling and elicitation of mitogenic, migratory and invasive responses in breast cancer...|$|R
