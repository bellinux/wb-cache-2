5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
50|$|The sensory {{information}} that is transmitted to the spinal cord is modulated by a complex network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. The two main <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters,</b> GABA and glycine, control the flow of {{sensory information}}.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} called the neocerebellum since phylogenetically it is the newest part of the cerebellum. It {{plays an important role}} in fine motor coordination, specifically in the inhibition of involuntary movement via <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters,</b> especially GABA.|$|R
50|$|However, {{aberrant}} {{mossy fiber}} sprouting may inhibit excitatory transmission by synapsing with basket cells which are inhibitory neurons and by releasing GABA and neuropeptide Y which are <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Also, in animal models, granule cell hyper-excitability is recorded before aberrant mossy fibre sprouting has occurred.|$|R
25|$|Blocks {{the action}} of adenosine; an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> that induces sleep, {{contracts}} the smooth muscles and relaxes the cardiac muscle.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol is {{classified}} as a sedative hypnotic drug. Alcohol produces a sedative effect by acting on receptors of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA. GABA receptors contain a binding site for the chemical, GABA, a chloride ion channel, and an additional binding site for alcohol molecules.|$|E
25|$|Ionotropic receptors, {{otherwise}} known as ligand-gated ion channels, are fast acting receptors that mediate neural and physiological function by ion channel flow with ligand-binding. Nicotinic, GABA, and Glutamate receptors are {{among some of the}} cell surface receptors regulated by ligand-gated ion channel flow. GABA is the brain's main <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> and glutamate is the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine is {{associated}} with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the limbic system increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases. The balance of excitatory to <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see Cognitive development below).|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of isovaline {{is similar to}} the amino acids GABA and glycine, the chief <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> in the mammalian central nervous system. Isovaline acts as an analgesic in mice [...] by activating peripheral GABAB receptors. In a mouse model of osteoarthritis isovaline restored mobility, suggesting inhibition of nociception by isovaline in the synovial membrane of the mouse knee.|$|R
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|R
25|$|Pregabalin is a GABAergic {{anticonvulsant}} and depressant of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS). It is classified as a GABA analogue and gabapentinoid. It is a close analogue of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VDCC). It increases extracellular GABA concentrations in the brain by producing a dose-dependent increase in L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for making GABA.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, {{which in turn}} increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. More {{research is needed to determine}} how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.|$|E
50|$|The {{action of}} the A-chain stops the {{affected}} neurons from releasing the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> GABA and glycine, but also excitatory transmitters, by degrading the protein synaptobrevin 2. The consequence of this is dangerous overactivity in the muscles from the smallest stimulus—the failure of inhibition of motor reflexes by sensory stimulation. This causes generalized contractions of the agonist and antagonist musculature, termed a tetanic spasm.|$|R
50|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA high {{prevalence}} of epilepsy in children is frequently found in developing countries. Though {{high rates of}} acquired brain injury may contribute, the possibility that malnutrition may lower seizure threshold has rarely been examined. This review suggests potential biochemical mechanisms that could adversely affect seizure threshold, particularly the effect of malnutrition on <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> and electrolytes. Supporting evidence from animal research and epidemiological findings in children are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The neuroadaptive {{processes}} {{involved in}} tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal mechanisms implicate both the GABAergic and the glutamatergic systems. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> of the central nervous system; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. GABA mediates the influx of chloride ions through ligand-gated chloride channels called GABAA receptors. When chloride enters the nerve cell, the cell membrane potential hyperpolarizes thereby inhibiting depolarization, or reduction in the firing rate of the post-synaptic nerve cell. Benzodiazepine potentiates the action of GABA, by binding a site between the α and γ subunits of the 5-subunit receptor thereby increasing {{the frequency of the}} GABA-gated chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA.|$|E
25|$|Side effects {{include a}} {{decreased}} level of consciousness {{along with a}} decreased effort to breathe. There is concern about both abuse and withdrawal following long-term use. It may also {{increase the risk of}} suicide. It is pregnancy category B or D (depending on how it is taken) in the United States and category D in Australia, meaning that it may cause harm when taken by pregnant women. If used during breastfeeding it may result in drowsiness in the baby. A lower dose is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function, as well as elderly people. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that works by increasing the activity of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA.|$|E
25|$|Some {{light was}} thrown on the {{mechanisms}} on sleep onset {{by the discovery}} that lesions in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus lead to insomnia while those in the posterior hypothalamus lead to sleepiness. Apart from this, {{it was found that}} lesions in oral pontine and midbrain reticular formation lead to loss of cortical activation. This was further narrowed down to show that the central midbrain tegmentum is the region that plays a role in cortical activation. Thus, sleep onset seems to arise from activation of the anterior hypothalamus along with inhibition of the posterior regions and the central midbrain tegmentum. Further research has shown that the hypothalamic region called ventrolateral preoptic nucleus produces the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA that inhibits the arousal system during sleep onset.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{neurotransmitter}} receptors: ligand-gated receptors or ionotropic receptors and G protein-coupled receptors or metabotropic receptors. Ligand-gated receptors can be excited by neurotransmitters (ligands) like glutamate and aspartate. These receptors can also be inhibited by neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine. Conversely, G protein-coupled receptors are neither excitatory nor inhibitory. Rather, they modulate the actions of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Most neurotransmitters receptors are G-protein coupled.|$|R
40|$|Interaction between astrocytes and neurons enriches the {{behavior}} of brain circuits. By releasing glutamate and ATP, astrocytes can directly excite neurons and modulate synaptic transmission. In the rat olfactory bulb, we demonstrate that the release of GABA by astrocytes causes long-lasting and synchronous inhibition of mitral and granule cells. In addition, astrocytes release glutamate, leading to a selective activation of granule-cell NMDA receptors. Thus, by releasing excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters,</b> astrocytes exert a complex modulatory control on the olfactory network...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} oral {{medications}} {{available for the}} management of epileptic seizures. They were previously called anticonvulsants. However, this term is misleading because most TLE seizures are, in fact, not convulsions. The modern term is antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Nearly all AEDs function by decreasing the excitation of neurons, for example, by blocking fast or slow sodium channels or by modulating calcium channels; or by enhancing the inhibition of neurons, for example by potentiating the effects of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> like GABA.|$|R
25|$|Caffeine is an {{antagonist}} at {{all four}} adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine {{for the human}} adenosine receptors are 12μM at A1, 2.4μM at A2A, 13μM at A2B, and 80μM at A3. Knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|GABRA1 is a {{gene that}} encodes for an α subunit of the GABA A {{receptor}} protein, which encodes {{one of the major}} <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> receptors. There is one known mutation in this gene that is associated with JME, A322D, which is located in the third segment of the protein. Expression of the α1β2γ2 combination of subunits in HEK 293 cells produces 6-fold greater current than similar subunits compositions containing mutant α1 subunits. The mutation also results in greatly decreased sensitivity in the receptor for activation by GABA. This combination of mutant containing receptors also activates far more slowly than wild-type containing receptors. Although originally not reported to result in altered protein trafficking, more recent study has indicated that the A322D mutation reduced α1 subunit trafficking to the membrane by >90%. Heterozygous expression of wild-type and mutant subunits produces current approximately 50% the size of wild-type due to this altered trafficking.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin was {{synthesized}} in 1990 as an anticonvulsant. It {{was invented}} by medicinal chemist Richard Bruce Silverman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Silverman {{is best known for}} identifying the drug pregabalin as a possible treatment for epileptic seizures. During 1988 to 1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules for Silverman. One looked particularly promising. The molecule was effectively shaped for transportation into the brain, where it activated L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme. Silverman hoped that the enzyme would increase production of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> GABA and block convulsions. Eventually, the set of molecules were sent to Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals for testing. The drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received FDA approval for use in treating epilepsy, diabetic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia in December 2004. Pregabalin then appeared on the US market under the brand name Lyrica in fall of 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of endrin {{poisoning}} include headache, dizziness, nervousness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and convulsions. [...] Acute endrin poisoning {{in humans}} affects primarily {{the central nervous}} system. There, it {{can act as a}} neurotoxin that blocks the activity of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> In cases of acute exposure, this may result in seizures, or even death. Because endrin can be stored in body fats, acute endrin poisoning can lead to recurrent seizures when stressors induce the release of endrin back into the body, even months after the initial exposure is terminated.|$|R
50|$|If {{a signal}} from the {{presynaptic}} neuron is <b>inhibitory,</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters,</b> normally GABA will be released into the synapse. This <b>neurotransmitter</b> causes an <b>inhibitory</b> postsynaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential {{makes it more difficult}} for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.|$|R
50|$|Postsynaptic depolarizations {{can either}} {{transmit}} excitatory or <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> Those that release excitatory vesicles {{are referred to}} as excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Alternatively, inhibitory vesicles stimulate postsynaptic receptors such as to allow Cl− ions to enter the cell or K+ ions to leave the cell, which results in an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). If the EPSP is dominant, the threshold of excitation in the postynaptic neuron may be reached, resulting in the generation of an action potential in the neuron(s) in turn postsynaptic to it, propagating the signal.|$|R
25|$|Barbiturates act as {{positive}} allosteric modulators, and at higher doses, as agonists of GABAA receptors. GABA {{is the principal}} <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Barbiturates bind to the GABAA receptor at multiple homologous transmembrane pockets located at subunit interfaces, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABAergic effect, barbiturates also block AMPA and kainate receptors, subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Taken together, the findings that barbiturates potentiate inhibitory GABAA receptors and inhibit excitatory AMPA receptors can explain the superior CNS-depressant effects of these agents to alternative GABA potentiating agents such as benzodiazepines and quinazolinones. At higher concentration, they inhibit the Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate via an effect on P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a {{presynaptic}} neuron releasing an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter,</b> such as GABA, can cause an {{inhibitory postsynaptic potential}} (IPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron, bringing the membrane potential {{farther away from the}} threshold, decreasing its excitability and making it more difficult for the neuron to initiate an action potential. If an IPSP overlaps with an EPSP, the IPSP can in many cases prevent the neuron from firing an action potential. In this way, the output of a neuron may depend on the input of many different neurons, each of which may have a different degree of influence, depending on the strength and type of synapse with that neuron. John Carew Eccles performed some of the important early experiments on synaptic integration, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963. Complex input/output relationships form the basis of transistor-based computations in computers, and are thought to figure similarly in neural circuits.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, {{making it}} {{chemically}} distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances {{the action of}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitter</b> in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord). Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels thereby suppressing the release of glutamate and aspartate, two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS. It is generally accepted {{to be a member of}} the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver.|$|E
50|$|The VLPO is {{activated}} by serotonin, adenosine and prostaglandin D2 which accumulate during wakefulness. A majority of VLPO neurons are GABAergic and galaninergic, primarily secreting the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> GABA and galanin respectively. The secretion of these <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> suppresses the arousal system {{and results in}} sleep. The VLPO also receives afferent projections from the DMS nuclei of the arousal system. These afferent projections secrete the arousal neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine which inhibit VLPO and result in wakefulness. VLPO firing is inversely proportionate to the activation of the arousal system (as VLPO firing increases, the arousal system firing decreases, and vice versa). A current theory suggests that VLPO and the arousal system exist in a simple A-B circuit, where A is inhibiting B and B is inhibiting A. This hypothesis, named the flip-flop switch model, suggests that the counteracting inhibition between VLPO and the arousal system results in the brain switching between two states, the sleep state and the wake state, so that at any time only one is firing; VLPO or the arousal system. Orexin neurons in the posterior of the hypothalamus excite brain nuclei in the arousal system and help keep you awake. Orexin neurons also extend to the VLPO likely inhibiting its activity. Thus orexin neurons are thought {{to play an important}} role in the stabilisation of the flip-flop switch regulating sleep and wakefulness.|$|R
50|$|Glycinergic and GABAergic {{inhibitory}} neurons make up {{half of all}} inspiratory neurons. Exposure of the pre-Bötzinger {{complex to}} these <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters</b> results in the rhythmic nature associated with respiration. Blocking this inhibition from Glycine or GABA causes it’s neurons to be incapable of switching from the active phase to the inspiration phase, demonstrated by shorter inspiratory activity (as seen in vivo). However, the absence of inhibitory synapses still resulted in rhythmic respiratory activity in vitro and in situ. This {{is largely due to}} the fact that respiratory rhythm results from numerous aspects, with synaptic inhibition playing only a single part.|$|R
40|$|In {{the mature}} {{central nervous system}} (CNS) GABA and glycine are the major <b>inhibitory</b> <b>neurotransmitters.</b> They act via {{shunting}} incoming excitatory currents and via moving the membrane potential away from the action potential threshold. However, during development, the action of GABA or glycine can be depolarizing and become even excitatory. This phenomenon {{plays a significant role}} in the maturation of the CNS, including neuronal migration and growth, synapse formation and plasticity of GABA synapses (Ben-Ari, 2002). Since synaptic inhibition operate mainly through Cl- fluxes, developmental regulation of this anion is crucial for the establishment of GABA/glycine inhibition...|$|R
