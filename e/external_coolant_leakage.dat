40|$|Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{method has}} been used to {{investigate}} the axial force of automotive water pump. As the excessive axial force can make some unexpected problems like impeller interference and <b>coolant</b> <b>leakage</b> we have focused on finding the cause of axial force and its reduction in this paper. First, we have tested the closed type water pump with and without balance hole by the calculation methods. By examining the pressure contour around the impeller, we have found that the axial force arises not only from the pressure difference around shroud but also from the pressure difference around hub. So we have tested two impellers- one is normal open type impeller and the other is open type impeller with modified hub. The results show that the axial force reduction is about 150 ~ 200 N for normal one and 700 N@ 3000 RPM for modified impeller. And the hydraulic efficiency which is important in aspect of engine fuel efficiency is reduced about 6. 5 % for normal one but increased 4 %@ 3000 RPM for modified impeller...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coolant</b> <b>leakage</b> {{leads to}} {{decrease}} in performance during {{the operation of}} electric vehicles which make use of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). This study examines the effects of various coolant leak conditions in 3 -cell stack and single cell. The experimental results show that an irreversible reduction in performance occurs after coolant injection into the anode side of the stack. Poisoning of carbon monoxide (CO) on the platinum (Pt) catalyst is caused by electro-oxidation reaction of EG. Water cleaning is selected because CO poisoning is desorbed to reaction with water molecules. Performance is quickly reduced when the interval between coolant injections is short. Performance reduction is indicated by the experimental results for the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). It shows that performance of the MEA with the GDL exposed to coolant decreased, but it is recovered after water cleaning. In contrast, results for performance of the MEA exposed to coolant for long time could not be reversed after water cleaning. Therefore, we propose that performance degradation of coolant leak on the Pt catalyst surface and GDL can be recovered by the water cleaning simply without disassembly of stack. close...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} {{in this case was}} for the Coventry Climax racing engines. Coventry Climax's more mundane utility engines did not require these seals, but they were adopted to production car engines such as the Hillman Imp, and when these were re-tuned for racing, it was a regular practice to add this type of supplementary seal. Some Coventry Climax designs, such as the FWMV V8, used an open-deck block with wet liners. These were located in place {{at the base of the}} liner, rather than near the cylinder head. They were thus susceptible to problems from differential thermal expansion, giving rise to <b>coolant</b> <b>leakage,</b> where the block and liner expanded at different rates: specifically when the liners contracted more rapidly as engine load was reduced. The solution to this was to redesign the liner so that they were located at the top instead, reducing the distance susceptible to expansion. The high compliance of the Wills Ring, thanks to their internal pressurisation, allowed reliable sealing, even though the short clamping distance now had little elasticity and so the applied clamping force from the head bolts could vary substantially.|$|R

Manufacturing flaws, as well as defects developed during the in-service operation, can lead to <b>coolant</b> <b>leakage</b> and can potentially damage the reactor.

Recent advances on ultrasonic inspection tools enable the provision of high resolution data of significantly large volumes.

The elbow assemblies were found to contain multiple intergranular cracks in the weld heat-affected zones. The cracking was predominantly axial in orientation in the forged elbow and wedge components, whereas mixed axial and circumferential cracking was seen in the wrought piping pieces. In at least two instances, axial cracks completely penetrated the circumferential weld joining adjacent components. Based upon the observations made in the present study, the failures were attributed to intergranular stress corrosion cracking caused by the weld-induced sensitized microstructure and residual stresses present; dissolved oxygen in the reactor coolant apparently served as the corrosive species. The predominantly axial orientation of the cracks present in the forged components is believed to be related to the banded microstructure present in these components. The metallographic studies reported are supplemented by x-radiography, chemical analysis and mechanical test results, determinations of the degree of sensitization present, and measurements of weld metal delta ferrite content...|$|R
