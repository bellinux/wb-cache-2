40|$|The {{fracture}} {{problem in}} concrete {{has been studied}} in great depth over the past thirty years. There have been many experimental and analytical attempts to calculate a work of fracture and to {{gain an understanding of}} the complex mechanisms of concrete fracture. An emerging theme is the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of the damage that occurs in loaded concrete. This has led to an increase in the amount of interior studies conducted. The insides of concrete have been exposed over the years by, among others, acoustic emission techniques, ultrasonics, dye penetration and radiography [1]. Most recently, x-ray microtomography has been used in order to see into the <b>heart</b> of <b>concrete</b> failure [2]...|$|R

30|$|The {{leaching}} procedure used in {{this study}} followed the test method SW 846 1311 -TCLP of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The test for MSWI BA was carried out on a sample crushed to a particle size of less than 4  mm. In the test for concrete cured for 28  days, concrete was broken into several pieces, and a piece from the <b>heart</b> of the <b>concrete</b> was taken as the test sample (average size of 9  mm) (Bertolini et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|Slym, who was {{originally}} from Derby, met his future wife, Sally, when he crashed his {{car at the}} age of 19 and she handled his insurance claim. Sally Slym née Earnes worked in the insurance industry in Britain, heading the human resources department of the AA’s retail insurance division. While living abroad with her husband, she taught business English to foreign executives. They married in September 1984. The couple did not have children and celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in 2009 by visiting the Indonesian island of Lombok, where Slym, a keen scuba diver, placed a giant <b>concrete</b> <b>heart</b> in a reclaimed coral reef to commemorate the occasion.|$|R
50|$|Located in the <b>heart</b> of <b>Concrete</b> Town Center on Main Street, the Concrete Herald Building was {{originally}} built in 1918 as a Model T Ford garage {{complete with a}} gas-station out front. When the building was later converted to be the Brommer Logging facility, a large apartment {{was added to the}} upper story. It was shortly after this that Concrete Herald owner and editor Charles M. “Chuck” Dwelley took over the building and made it into a modern printing facility and new home of The Concrete Herald (established in 1910). When Robert and June Fader purchased the newspaper upon Dwelley's retirement in late 1970, the building remained the home for the weekly. When the building and newspaper were sold in 1990, the facility became a printing shop until the current owners turned the first floor into a liquor store franchise through the state liquor control board. The Concrete Herald Building has remained a liquor store to this date. As for Concrete Herald, Concrete Mayor Jason Miller has given rebirth to the newspaper after purchasing the Upriver Community News from another local resident. As of May 6, 2009, Concrete Herald began a monthly publication schedule. The newspaper is sold in various locations throughout Skagit County.|$|R
2500|$|The Cathedral {{was built}} by Jamieson and Sons who built many other major ecclesiastical and {{municipal}} buildings in New Zealand. Petre had previous experience in using concrete, designing dock walls and sewers as a draughtsman. This knowledge allowed Petre to require innovative methods during construction such as pouring <b>heart</b> walls with <b>concrete</b> and then facing with stone. Mass-produced components were widely used, including curved arches made in a purpose built moulding machine. [...] Fifty men were employed on the site, and in excess of 120,000 cubic ft (3400 m³) of stone, 4,000 cubic ft (110 m³) of concrete, and 90 tons of steel {{were used in the}} construction. After its completion the Cathedral, constructed of concrete sheathed in Oamaru limestone, was widely acclaimed, later causing George Bernard Shaw to describe Petre as a [...] "New Zealand Brunelleschi".|$|R
50|$|Concrete Night {{tells about}} a 14-year-old boy named Simo (Johannes Brotherus) who still lacks his {{own sense of}} self and the ability to protect himself from his surroundings. Simo and his big brother Ilkka are the sons of a {{helpless}} and unpredictable single mother. Their chaotic home is located deep in the <b>heart</b> of a <b>concrete</b> jungle in Helsinki. Ilkka has one day of freedom left before starting his prison sentence. The mother persuades Simo to spend the last night with his brother. Events heighten throughout the one day and night in Helsinki and the brothers witness incidents they would rather not see. Simo, who has no ability to distort what he sees or delude himself, sees things accurately as they are. When unfiltered, the world seems unbearable. Finally a casual encounter with a photographer, whose intentions Simo misreads, launches him into blind fear, which explodes in panic stricken violence. In this violence Simo finds his lacking identity, his true face.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>heart</b> of the <b>concrete</b> {{batching}} plant is the mixer, {{and there are}} many types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{conflicting}} accounts {{as to how}} Wilkins came up {{with the}} idea for the tub. [...] Wilkins said, [...] "I woke up in the middle of the night with the idea of a heart-shaped bathtub. I immediately ran down to the basement of my house and drew a big <b>heart</b> on the <b>concrete</b> floor and called Obie O'Brien. He came over the next day, and we began planning construction..." [...] Honest Phil Policare, Chief Excitement Officer at Cove Haven, said that Wilkins and O'Brien were planning to put whirlpools in every suite, and the first one they bought was a common circle. [...] "When Wilkins and Obie were carrying the prototype down a flight of stairs, they ran into a corner. In order to make the turn, they needed to distort the shape a bit. When they finally got the bath through, they realized it reflected a heart shape... perfect for a couples resort." ...|$|R
40|$|Outwith is a {{collaboration}} between Sally Underwood and Roxy Walsh. Their ongoing research explores co-habitation, shelter, dwelling and time, exploring how gallery space is inhabited and lived by the bodies within it. Dwellings and small architectures are central to these explorations: artworks sited within other artworks. UnderwoodWalsh were invited by Jessica Kenney to make a site specific installation for Art Exchange, the gallery of the University of Essex, for January/February 2015. The campus is a spectacular collection of largely brutalist buildings set in Wivenhoe park, rolling parkland made famous by John Constable’s 1816 painting. The predominant materials on campus are concrete and engineering brick. Though faced with 1980 ’s (bijou postmodern) brick patterns, the building that houses Art Exchange has a <b>heart</b> of <b>concrete</b> like the others. At Art Exchange, ‘shelter’ or location was provided a putative tree, echoing both the parkland of the campus and the shuttered concrete structure at {{the centre of the}} gallery building. Its exposed roots were bracketed by small walls of engineering brick and kindling in response to the spectacular use of engineering brick in the North Towers. The thin blue light of winter was echoed in watercolour above, and painted panels punctuated the space - sometimes pictorially but more often spatially, alongside large passages of painting directly onto the walls. Parkland outside of the gallery was made visible again by the uncovering of a picture window that had been walled in for a number of years. An accompanying text was commissioned from George Vase...|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original <b>heart</b> pine planks. <b>Concrete</b> blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the display of the iconic Caryatids in the New Acropolis Museum has been seriously {{compromised}} by the overriding desire amongst Greek politicians and heritage professionals to use the museum to reinforce their long-standing request {{for the return of}} the Parthenon Marbles. In designing a museum geared primarily to achieving the repatriation of the sculptures taken from the largest of the temples on the Athenian Acropolis, the museum’s architect has ensured that these marbles were presented within sight of their former monumental home, exhibited in a manner that imitates the architectural layout of the Parthenon, while the large windows of the museum allow vast amounts of natural light to illuminate the marbles. By contrast, the five Caryatids that remain in Athens have been treated with considerably less respect for such restitutionist sensibilities. Displayed within the <b>concrete</b> <b>heart</b> of the museum, lacking views of the outside world, let alone to the Acropolis, and with limited access to direct natural light, the marble women are positioned with no consideration for their original alignment. The important functional role of the Caryatids as integral structural elements within the architecture of the Erechtheum is also poorly represented in the manner of their current museological display in Athens...|$|R
40|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>Heart</b> Land {{exposes the}} social {{cleansing}} of the Heygate Estate in Elephant and Castle, South London. It marks {{the moment that}} the estate was finally lost as social housing {{to make way for}} an unjust 'regeneration' scheme. Assembled from 12 years of archive materials the film charts the struggles of the local community to keep their homes, stay living in the area, and maintain communal benefits {{in the face of the}} advance of this now notorious 'urban redevelopment programme'. Throughout the film we hear the community engaging in some of the crucial battles with elected officials, planners, and barristers in municipal planning meetings, public enquiries, and interviews. Weaving through these recordings is a performance staged in 2012 on the then still inhabited estate. An assembled group of past and present residents, community activists, and critics of the Heygate plans chant texts composed from phrases used in the Regeneration Masterplan. The performances parody the technical language of regeneration and the aspirational language of gentrification. Over the course of 2012 and 2013 we filmed panoramic video images of the estate and interiors of some of the Heygate flats, all of which feature in the film. Having evicted the last residents in November 2013, Southwark Council and the developer Lend Lease are currently working towards the wider gentrification of the area...|$|R
6000|$|So Rossetti; the Shelley editions, 1818 and 1839, read clog, {{which is}} {{retained}} by Forman, Dowden, and Woodberry. Rossetti's happy conjecture, clod, seems to Forman 'a doubtful emendation, as Shelley {{may have used}} clog in its [figurative] sense of weight, encumbrance.'--Hardly, as here, in a poetical figure: that would be to use a metaphor within a metaphor. Shelley compares his <b>heart</b> to a <b>concrete</b> object: if clog is right, the word must be taken in one or other of its two recognized LITERAL senses--'a wooden shoe,' or 'a block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of a horse or a dog.' Again, it is of others' hearts, not of his own, that Shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight; besides, how could he appropriately describe his heart as a weight or encumbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion, seeing that for Shelley, above all men, the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action? That source, he complains, has been dried up--its emotions desiccated--by the crushing impact of other hearts, heavy, hard and cold as stone. His heart has become withered and barren, like a lump of earth parched with frost--'a lifeless clod.' Compare [...] "Summer and Winter", lines 11-15:-- 'It was a winter such as when birds die In the deep forests; and the fishes lie Stiffened in the translucent ice, which makes Even the mud and slime of the warm lakes A wrinkled clod as hard as brick;' etc., etc.|$|R
