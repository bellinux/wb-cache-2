He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up <b>in</b> <b>moments,</b> finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E

However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam {{of light that}} engulfs Discord and Ponyville. <b>In</b> <b>moments,</b> Ponyville has been {{returned}} to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Bocks {{discover}} that Pfaster's mother had owned a car which matches paint found on Scully's abandoned car, tracking down her former residence. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from Pfaster {{as he prepares}} a cold bath for her, resulting in a pursuit through the house. Scully and Pfaster have a struggle that sends them falling down a staircase onto the foyer, where a task force led by Mulder and Bocks breaks <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> later and apprehends Pfaster. Scully initially insists that she is okay, but then breaks down and cries in Mulder's arms. In a voice-over narration, Mulder traces Pfaster's pathology to his childhood, when {{he was raised in}} a family of four older sisters. Mulder also reflects on Pfaster's nature and the nature of evil in general.|$|E
3000|$|We use the {{scenario}} shown in Fig.  2 as example. In this figure, black broken line means depth curve of bottom boundary for certain stratum.

Then strata were compacted until <b>in</b> the <b>moment</b> t 0, when stratum depth was deeper than <b>in</b> <b>moment</b> t 2. <b>In</b> the <b>moment</b> t x, which was between t 1 and t 0, stratum depth should be the same as depth <b>in</b> <b>moment</b> t 2.

5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E

This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death, as well as <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> of extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily flanged, deepened register. However, the voice is not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually {{when they need to}} deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing. The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a sarcophagus. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil. Being host to a Goa'uld {{has been described as a}} living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.|$|E
25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production of that story, leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many ways, she might be claimed to be the companion most like her Doctor (if Romana I were not more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E
25|$|Terra is {{the first}} {{introduced}} character, a mentally-enslaved Imperial super-soldier gifted with devastating magic. She is tasked to the Magitek-armored assault on Narshe, slaughtering most of the town's militia {{in pursuit of a}} recently unearthed frozen Esper. Upon encountering the creature, her Imperial contingent is annihilated together with her armor. She wakes in Arvis' home, freed of her slave crown and suffering amnesia. Pursued into the depths of Narshe's mines by local forces, she is eventually rescued by Locke (a member of the Returners) and a horde of moogles. After experiencing events in the Figaro kingdom and after another Imperial assault on Narshe to claim the Esper, she eventually learns that she is the daughter of an Esper father and human mother, explaining her natural magical abilities. Brain-washed, extensively trained and manipulated, she had been instrumental in the Empire's subjugation of the other city-states on the southern continent, her powers even decimating fifty Imperial troops <b>in</b> <b>moments.</b> Instrumental in the Returner's strategy to ally with the Espers beyond the sealed gate, Terra succeeds in opening the barrier between worlds and unintentionally unleashes the Espers' devastating obliteration of the Empire.|$|E

25|$|Before moving {{onto the}} second scene the {{audience}} is treated {{to some of the}} footage edited on the big screen. This short clip features some pre-filmed shots with those that include the volunteers. The second scene begins with the rally car racing in from the left hand side and performing a 360 turn. This is followed by the two police cars who race <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> later. The three cars exit from the far right and return {{in the middle of the}} arena. The rally car then skids 180 and stops while the two police cars circle it. It then proceeds to reverse out of the arena. Upon returning, the car begins to perform a variety of figure 8 near-misses with the two police cars in reverse. Unknown to the audience at the time is that when the car is reversed out of the scene, it is swapped for a specifically designed, reverse car. The car is then swapped back to the forwards driving car in a similar style. At this point all three cars drive along a two-wheel kicker ramp, which allows the cars to drive on two wheels. All three cars drive in a figure 8 motion around the arena on two wheels before returning to all four at the same moment. The scene ends with the return of the motorcyclist who rides through a wall of fire before being stopped by the police.|$|E
25|$|Moses's {{power was}} further eroded by his {{association}} with the 1964 New York World's Fair. His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties {{in the face of}} evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities. In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating {{to the success of the}} event. Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate. The United States had already staged the sanctioned Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962. According to the rules of the organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for Expo 67 in Montreal.|$|E
25|$|After Emma and Hook are {{dragged into}} Zelena's time portal, she accepts Storybrooke as her home, regaining her magic to re-open the portal {{to the present}} where she begins a {{relationship}} with Hook. However, unaware to her, she also brings a previously deceased Maid Marian to the future which ruins Regina's happiness, having not heeded the warning of messing with the past. Elsa, who was trapped in an urn, was also brought to Storybrooke by the time portal. While working with Elsa, who helps Emma to finally embrace and control her powers, Emma helps her new friend find her sister and return home while balancing {{the threat of the}} Snow Queen against her friends and family. After a period of peace, Emma begins to help Regina on her quest to find the Author of Henry's book. Cruella De Vil and Ursula soon come into town resurrecting Maleficent and working with Rumplestiltskin to find the Author of the magical tome Once Upon a Time. After Cruella De Vil threatens to kill Henry, Emma kills her, soon after learning of her parents' actions of removing Emma's potential for darkness by putting black magic within Maleficent's daughter and Emma's childhood friend Lily. After Emma returns to town, with the encouragement from Hook, she chooses to forgive her parents and let go of her anger. <b>In</b> <b>moments</b> before the finale, Emma is able to finally let her walls down and tells Hook she loves him. Emma then chooses to sacrifice herself for the town of Storybrooke, asking her parents and Hook to save her, she voluntarily plunges the dagger into the Darkness, transforming into the new Dark One.|$|E
