5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal played Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round on 9 March 2002. It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, {{and in spite of}} Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to a 1–1 draw. A replay was {{scheduled}} two weeks later at noon. Arsenal won by three goals to nil, but during the match lost Robert Pirès to injury; he was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick, was enough for Arsenal to win the semi-final.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore won the {{overtime}} coin toss {{and elected}} to receive. The Ravens started the drive {{at their own}} 15yard line. The Steelers <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for no gain {{on the first two}} plays and Lawrence Timmons sacked Flacco on third down. The Steelers took over after a punt and Mewelde Moore caught a 24-yard reception to bring the Steelers to Baltimore's 31-yard line. Jeff Reed converted a 46-yard field goal to win the game for the Steelers. Reed was named the NFL's special teams player of the week. With the win the Steelers passed the Ravens for first place in the AFC North at 3–1, as well as extending their all-time record of 14consecutive home wins on Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, The Hurricane won the WWF Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania X8, but Molly betrayed him, {{hitting him}} {{in the back of the}} head with a frying pan, and {{defeating}} him for the championship. Helms was later drafted to the SmackDown! brand following the brand extension, and he won the Cruiserweight Championship from Tajiri and Billy Kidman in a triple threat match. He lost it to Jamie Noble at King of the Ring.

5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully <b>held</b> <b>them</b> off.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi and Marcomanni {{once again}} invaded Roman {{territory}} in 169. The Iazyges led an invasion into Alburnum, {{in an attempt}} to seize its gold mines. Marcus Claudius Fronto, a former general during the Parthian wars, then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, <b>held</b> <b>them</b> back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace, but the name of their client-king is not known.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, <b>held</b> <b>them</b> at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused to approve a decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of polyandry in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, the 2/15th Infantry Battalion set {{out from}} Katika to capture Nongora on 30 November. They {{advanced}} over broken countryside and after the lead company had crossed the Song River, they were engaged by machine-gun fire from a strong defensive position. This <b>held</b> <b>them</b> up briefly, until the other companies came up. Skirting the position, they continued on towards Nongora where they stopped short of the high ground and established a defensive position for the night. The following morning, the Australians launched a costly and unsuccessful company-level attack against the ridge, but after darkness the Japanese abandoned the position, allowing the 2/15th to occupy it and then clear Nongora on 2 December. Following this, they began sending fighting patrols out towards the Christmas Hills area in the west, and to the east towards the Lakes {{to make contact with}} the 24th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists <b>held</b> <b>them</b> in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E

They defeated The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) to win the belts and <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for over six months. They eventually dropped the title in a match against The Executioners (a team composed of Killer Kowalski and Big John Studd, who wore masks to hide their identities) on May 11, 1976. Also in 1976, Parisi teamed with champion Bruno Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to defeat Ivan Koloff and Superstar Billy Graham.When the promotion (which had since been renamed the World Wrestling Federation) decided to reactivate the WWF International Heavyweight Championship in 1982, Parisi became the new champion.

5|$|Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) are {{the current}} champions, having {{defeated}} Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero) {{to win the}} title on February 13, 2015. They are the 27th overall championship team and this is their first reign as a team. Místico and Valiente have previously held the championship with Máscara Dorada. 25 different teams have held the title, combining for 27 individual title reigns. Only two teams have held the title more than once, the first champions Los Infernales and the team of Héctor Garza, Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara. Black Warrior, Blue Panther and Dr. Wagner Jr. hold {{the record for the}} longest single reign of any team, but due to the uncertainty of when the championship was vacated it can only be verified that they <b>held</b> <b>them</b> for a minimum of 1,141 days.

He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights.
