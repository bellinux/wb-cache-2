2500|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages. The product of the basic <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> current of the movement, and {{the sum of the}} series resistance and the movement's own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range.|$|E
2500|$|Any meter will {{load the}} circuit under test to some extent. For example, a {{multimeter}} using a moving coil movement with <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> current of 50 microamps, the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 microamps from the circuit under {{test for the}} meter {{to reach the top}} end of its scale. This may load a high-impedance circuit so much as to affect the circuit, thereby giving a low reading. The <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> current may also be expressed in terms of [...] "ohms per volt". The ohms per volt figure is often called the [...] "sensitivity" [...] of the instrument. Thus a meter with a 50 microampere movement will have a [...] "sensitivity" [...] of 20,000 ohms per volt. [...] "Per volt" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} impedance the meter presents to the circuit under test will be 20,000 ohms multiplied by the full-scale voltage to which the meter is set. For example, if the meter is set to a range of 300 volts full scale, the meter's impedance will be 6 megohms. 20,000 ohms per volt is the best (highest) sensitivity available for typical analog multimeters that lack internal amplifiers. For meters that do have internal amplifiers (VTVMs, FETVMs, etc.), the input impedance is fixed by the amplifier circuit.|$|E
50|$|As an {{ohmmeter}} the Model 8 Mark II measures from 1 Ω up to 20 MΩ {{in three}} ranges. The instrument has an accuracy of ±1% of FSD on DC current ranges, ±2% of FSD on DC voltage ranges, ±2.25% of FSD on all AC ranges and ±5% of reading (at centre scale only) on resistance ranges. Its maximum current draw of 50 μA at <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> (corresponding to 20,000 ohms per volt) is sufficient {{in most cases}} to reduce voltage measurement error due to circuit loading by the meter to an acceptable level.|$|E
5000|$|The turn {{coordinator}} {{may be used}} as {{a performance}} instrument when the attitude indicator has failed. This is called [...] "partial panel" [...] operations. It can be unnecessarily difficult or even impossible if the pilot does not understand that the instrument is showing roll rates as well as turn rates. The usefulness is also impaired if the internal dashpot is worn out. In the latter case, the instrument is underdamped and in turbulence will indicate large <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflections</b> to the left and right, all of which are actually roll rate responses.|$|R
5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflections</b> of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to examine the requirements for using electromechanical flight instrumentation to provide guidance for manually controlled flight along complex, curved approach paths within the microwave landing system signal coverage. The data from these tests indicated that flight director guidance is required for the manually controlled flight of a jet transport airplane on complex, curved approach paths. Each of the three guidance algorithms tested could be used to fly the paths. However, pilot comments indicated that the use of guidance based on capturing the next straight path segment may not be acceptable since <b>full-scale</b> lateral <b>deflections</b> normally resulted during turns. Pilot comments indicated that all the approach paths tested could be used in normal airline operations. Approach paths with both multiple, sequential turns and short final path segments were demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|The D'Arsonval {{galvanometer}} is {{a moving}} coil ammeter. It uses magnetic deflection, where current {{passing through a}} coil placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet causes the coil to move. The modern form of this instrument was developed by Edward Weston, and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the deflection of the meter linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales. Basic meter movements can have <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> for currents from about 25 microamperes to 10 milliamperes.|$|E
50|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages. The product of the basic <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> current of the movement, and {{the sum of the}} series resistance and the movement's own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range. As an example, a meter movement that required 1 milliampere for full scale deflection, with an internal resistance of 500 ohms, would, on a 10-volt range of the multimeter, have 9,500 ohms of series resistance.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary Weston-type meter {{movements}} {{can measure}} only milliamperes at most, because the springs and practical coils can carry only limited currents. To measure larger currents, a resistor called a shunt {{is placed in}} parallel with the meter. The resistances of shunts is in the integer to fractional milliohm range. Nearly all of the current flows through the shunt, and {{only a small fraction}} flows through the meter. This allows the meter to measure large currents. Traditionally, the meter used with a shunt has a <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> (FSD) of 50 mV, so shunts are typically designed to produce a voltage drop of 50 mV when carrying their full rated current.|$|E
40|$|Technology {{developed}} for the Circulation Control Wing high-lift system has been extended to augment lift by entraining and redirecting engine thrust. Ejecting a thin jet sheet tangentially over a small curved deflecting surface adjacent to the slipstream of a turbofan engine causes the slipstream to flow around that deflecting surface. The angle of deflection is controlled pneumatically by varying {{the momentum of the}} thin jet sheet. The downward momentum of the slipstream enhances wing lift. This concept of pneumatically deflecting the slipstream has been applied to an upper surface blowing high-lift system and to a thrust deflecting system. The capability of the pneumatic upper surface blowing system was demonstrated in a series of investigations using a wind tunnel model and the NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA). <b>Full-scale</b> thrust <b>deflections</b> greater than 90 deg were achieved. This mechanically simple system can provide increased maneuverability, heavy lift or overload capability, or short takeoff and landing performance...|$|R
5000|$|A {{localizer}} type directional aid (LDA) {{is a type}} of localizer-based {{instrument approach}} to an airport. It is used in places where, due to terrain and other factors, the localizer antenna array is not aligned with the runway it serves. In these cases, the localizer antenna array may be offset (i.e. pointed or aimed) {{in such a way that}} the approach course it projects no longer lies along the extended runway centerline (which is the norm for non-offset and non-LDA localizer systems). If the angle of offset is thirty degrees or less, the facility is classified as an offset localizer. If the offset angle is greater than thirty degrees, the facility is classified as a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). As a [...] "directional aid," [...] and only a Category I (CAT I) approach, rather than a full-fledged instrument landing system (ILS), the LDA is more commonly used to help the pilot safely reach a point near the runway environs, where he or she hopefully can see the runway, at which point he or she will proceed and land visually, as opposed to (for example) full Category III (CAT III) ILS systems that allow a pilot to fly, without visual references, very close to the runway surface (usually about 100ft) depending on the exact equipment in the aircraft and on the ground. [...] An LDA uses exactly the same equipment to create the course as a standard localizer used in ILS. An LDA approach also is designed with a normal course width, which is typically 3 to 6 degrees. (At each [...] "edge-of-course," [...] commonly 1.5 or 3 degrees left and right of course, the transmitted signal is created in such a way as to ensure <b>full-scale</b> CDI needle <b>deflection</b> at and beyond these edges, so the pilot will never falsely believe that he is intercepting the course outside of the actual course area. The area between these <b>full-scale</b> needle <b>deflections</b> is what defines the course width.) An LDA approach (considered a non-precision approach) may have one or more marker beacons, perhaps a DME, and in rare instances a glide slope, just as other precision approaches have, such as ILS approaches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Avometer {{was designed}} to measure direct current (3 ranges, 0.12, 1.2 & 12A), direct voltage (3 ranges, 12, 120 & 600V) and resistance (single range, 0 - 10,000 ohms, 225 ohms mid-scale). All ranges could be selected by a single rotary switch which set both the function and the range value. A second switch brought a rheostat into circuit in series with the instrument and {{could be used to}} control the current through a device under test and the meter. The movement drew 12mA for <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> and used a [...] "universal shunt" [...] permanently in parallel with the movement which increased the input terminal full-scale current to 16.6mA, corresponding to 60 ohms per volt. It had a knife edge pointer and an anti-parallax mirror.|$|E
50|$|The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is {{an example}} of the iron vane type, used for {{measuring}} large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non-sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the clamping assembly to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the hinged end of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large conductors and bus bars up to 4+1/2 in wide. As the illustration shows, the scale is very non-linear and unsuitable for measuring low currents, with currents of less than half the <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> crammed into a short section of the dial.|$|E
30|$|Turbidity {{measurements}} of redispersed ZnS nanopowder {{were taken in}} a digital turbidity meter (Decibel Instruments) with an accuracy of ± 3 % of <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection.</b> Powdered ZnS nanoparticles (0.04 g) were dispersed in 35 mL water and sonicated for 30 min, then kept undisturbed in glass cuvette in the cuvette holder of turbidity meter. Turbidity of solution (in NTU) was noted after regular intervals.|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase liquid-chromatographic {{procedure}} is presented for quantitation of uric acid in human serum, with absorbance measured at 292 nm. The mobile phase was sodium acetate (35 mmoi/L, pH 5. 0) /acetonitrile(9 / 1 by vol). Complete precipitation of serum proteins was ob-tained by mixing serum (50 - 500 tL) {{with an equal}} volume of acetonitrile, and the precipitate was removed by cen-trifugation. Aliquots (20 L) of the supernate were injected directly into the liquid chromatograph, which was adjusted so that the absorbance reading of the uric acid peak was as high as possible. Routinely, a <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> of 1. 28 absorbance units was used. The within-run precision (CV) was 0. 6 % for a serum uric acid concentration of 227 zmol/L, and th day-to-day precision over a 15 -day period was 0. 8 % for uric acid of 345 smoI/L.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} the concentration of {{carbon dioxide in the}} expired air, based on the variation of the gas in water, is described. The sensitivity of the basic instrument is such that it is able to measure parts per million but is non-linear above 1 % carbon dioxide. The construction of a modified instrument to produce a linear output between 0 - 10 % carbon dioxide is described. In 1865 Tyndall delivered a paper in which he stated that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the expired air could be measured by the amount by which it absorbed infra-red radiation. Although many improvements have been incorporated since that date, the method outlined by Tyndall remains the most commonly used method of measuring the carbon dioxide content of the air. A typical com-mercially available instrument has a <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection</b> of 10 %, an accuracy of ± 1 % of the <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection,</b> and an overall response time of about 1. 5 sec, {{depending on the size of}} the sample tube used. This paper describes a new method based on an idea first published in a letter from James (1972) which considerably increased the clinical use of the first instrument as it is potentially cheaper, smaller and easier to use. In his letter, James pointed out that the amount by which de-ionized water increased its conduc-tivity when a gas was bubbled through it was pro-portional to the amount of gas which dissolved in the water to form ions. The apparatus used to demonstrate this is shown diagrammatically in figure 1. It consists of a chamber (partly filled with water), the bottom half of which is filled with a de-ionizing resin R. From the bottom of the cham-ber a tube leads back to the top of the chamber C. Any water leaving C and entering the tube will be de-ionized and as a result the resistance of the water as measured by the electrodes E in the tube will be very great. A small pump P connected t...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we show a simple isocratic chromatographic method for the {{detection}} of serotonin and its precursors and metabolites from various types of gastrointestinal tissue. The paper measures for the first time basal measurements of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract, which has recently been shown to be released from the musosal lining of the gut. Tissue samples were stable following sample preparation in either 0. 1 m perchloric acid or mobile phase. Analysis was carried out using a mobile phase consisting of 10 % acetonitrile- 90 % acetate acid buffer pH 4. 0 with 2 mm decane-sulfonic acid sodium salt at a column temperature of 50 degrees C. Electrochemical detection was utilized at a potential of + 850 mV vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode at 10 microA <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection.</b> The detection limit of 5 -HT and melatonin was 241 and 308 nm respectively for a 10 microL injection. As a result of the method optimization, total analysis was reduced to 30 min. Accurate responses of the tissue samples following sample preparation could be obtained following a week after storage at - 80 degrees C. This method is capable of preparing and analysing of samples from all regions of the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Shaft encoders, are devices {{generally}} used {{in speed}} and position control applications for sensing position of rotational and linearly moving objects. Most conventional shaft encoders {{operate on the}} principle of reading encoded information off a disk, which is fitted to the shaft or using resolver units. Problems are often experienced in fitting high-resolution encoder disks or resolvers to small motors or moving objects. The resolution of an encoder system, using an encoded disk, {{is a function of the}} maximum number of slots that are cut in the disk. If the disk itself has to be very small, physical constraints limit the accuracy of the encoder. However, any machined surface will have characteristic marks on it and it is believed that these marks can be used to obtain a unique analogue signature for the shaft. This analogue signature can then be used to gain further knowledge about the rotational speed and possibly the position of the shaft. This project was an investigation into the possibility of gaining accurate, absolute positional information for a rotating shaft. An optical source- and detector system is used in the process of observing the irregularities on the shaft surface. This signal data is gathered and processed using a technique, which compensates for variation in shaft speed during the period in which data is sampled. The entire algorithm, which calculates the absolute position of the shaft from the data gathered, was implemented on a digital signal processor board. Results were evaluated and the maximum non-linearity of the test system was found to vary between 1. 8 % and 3. 7 % of <b>full-scale</b> <b>deflection.</b> The resolution of the sensor was between 1. 5 and 2. 5 degrees with hysteresis between 1 % and 1. 5 % of full scale deflection. The test system allows for rotation in any direction. Possible problems that might be encountered with this type of encoder system are pointed out in this report. Future developments and possible improvements are also discussed...|$|E
