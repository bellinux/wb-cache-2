5|$|During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League {{in double}} plays {{made by a}} second baseman {{for the second year}} in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers in {{contention}} for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

Hugo Montenegro <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> with a version of the main theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

25|$|The {{following}} year, he {{contributed a}} character {{voice to the}} animal cast of the film Dr. Dolittle 2. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> with the 2002 release Big Fat Liar, which teamed him with teen actress Amanda Bynes {{as a pair of}} students seeking revenge on a sleazy movie producer (played by Paul Giamatti). Muniz was also part of the ensemble for the gang film Deuces Wild, released that same year. In 2003, he made a cameo appearance as Cher's underage boyfriend in Stuck on You. That same year, he appeared in the series premiere of Ashton Kutcher's MTV practical joke series Punk'd.|$|E
25|$|After the split, Dudley, Jeczalik, and Langan {{moved to}} the UK-based China Records label, taking the Art of Noise name with them. Some of the band's {{original}} imagery and ethos was retained for their second album, In Visible Silence. This album spawned the Grammy Award-winning cover of the Peter Gunn theme, recorded with Duane Eddy, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> with Peter Gunn in 1959. The Art of Noise collaboration reached number two on the Billboard dance charts. The Peter Gunn video featured comedian Rik Mayall in a parody of the private eye film genre.

He released a few solo LPs and singles during this period, two of note being 1971's Watcha Gonna Do? and 1974's Waiting for a Song, {{the latter of}} which went unreleased in the US. Featuring both Michelle and Cass on background vocals, the recordings would be Elliot's last, as she died after a sold-out run in London {{a few months later}} after the record was finished. Doherty was stunned and saddened to hear about her death in 1974 at age 32. He attended her funeral several days later in early August along with the Phillipses.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March, Parma faced Champions League spot-chasing Lazio, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> {{a run of}} bad form. Parma's Cristian Zaccardo {{made his}} 100th {{appearance}} for the club. Parma took the lead early on with the first chance when McDonald Mariga capitalised on Federico Marchetti's goalkeeping error to hit home from nine yards. Sergio Floccari, on loan from Lazio, doubled the lead with an easy header after a Gabriel Paletta miscue. Parma remained on top, but both sides had further chances before Lazio pegged one back before half-time through Lionel Scaloni. Play was briefly suspended midway through the second half after a floodlight failure at the Tardini and Lazio might have equalised soon after the restart. Floccari completed a brace with 18 minutes {{to go with a}} fine volley off Giovinco's free-kick. This put Parma 8 points clear of the relegation zone, although eighteenth-placed Lecce did have a game in hand.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{recording}} of A Boy In A Man's World, LePage, {{who had never been}} considered an official member of the band, left due to touring conflicts. He was replaced by Dave Neabore. Shortly after the album was released, the band found themselves on their first tour of Europe. Although Mucky Pup never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> in the U.S., their European distribution deal, combined with this tour, helped the band attain success in Europe. When the band returned home, Nastasi resigned and helped co-found the band Non-Fiction with former members of Hades. Nastasi stayed with Non-Fiction for a short time before leaving to embark on a brief stint with Murphy's Law. Nastasi's position in Mucky Pup was filled by band friend Sean Kilkenny. After a year or so, Neabore and Kilkenny left to form the band Dog Eat Dog and Nastasi returned to Mucky Pup while simultaneously joining Dog Eat Dog as well.|$|E

40|$|The ALICE TOF {{detector}} {{is vital}} for particle identification at intermediate momenta.

In addition, we wanted to correct for {{the fact that some of}} the tracks would pass through dead areas of the TOF.
