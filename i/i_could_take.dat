500|$|Reeves fired Shaughnessy {{after two}} seasons, {{because he had}} created [...] "internal friction". One source {{explained}} that Shaughnessy's eccentricities and continuously expanding playbook had taken its toll on the players. He was replaced by assistant coach Joe Stydahar. Shaughnessy said, [...] "Stydahar coach the Rams? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a high school team and beat him." [...] Stydahar, however, led the Rams to the National Conference Championship that season, and the team set numerous NFL passing and scoring records.|$|E

Quinn also submitted the game through Steam's Greenlight program and consequently received disparaging comments and hate mail, causing her to withdraw the game from the service. After receiving positive feedback from players who had played the game and receiving an invitation to Indiecade, she tried Greenlight again. She received further harassment, but felt that she could deal with the stress. [...] "I thought, honestly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the hate if it meant the game could reach somebody who would {{get something out of}} it, feel less alone," [...] Quinn stated.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the move}} to a Friday evening timeslot, Enterprise was going up {{directly}} against episodes of Stargate SG-1 on the Sci Fi Channel. The overall ratings by Nielsen Media Research placed the show in 150th place for the season. The season opened with ratings of 2.0/4 percent {{for the first part}} of [...] "", [...] but the series lowest ratings were received for the mid season episode [...] "". Five other episodes equalled the 2.0/4 percent ratings of [...] "Storm Front" [...] while [...] "Cold Station 12", [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] each received 2.1/4 percent ratings. However, the highest ratings of the seasons were received for the series finale, [...] "These Are The Voyages...", which gained ratings of 2.4/4 percent. Rick Berman credited the falling ratings received by the series to a variety of elements saying, [...] "The show certainly had a great start. It got very good reviews and it had a huge audience for the first half a dozen episodes and then it started to slip. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the blame for it. I could put the blame into the scripts. I could put the blame into franchise fatigue. I don’t know why it didn’t work." ...|$|E
500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E

500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, [...] "Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making {{themselves}} millionaires. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> {{the whole business}} away from them." [...] In 1925, {{he set out to}} do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money. In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as [...] "exceedingly American" [...] (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: [...] "not Jewish," [...] in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's [...] "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frank Zappa, who {{had been}} {{interested}} in film since high school, decided to develop a film vehicle for the Mothers of Invention, entitled Uncle Meat.
