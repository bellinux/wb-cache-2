In the case of magnetoelastic materials, there is another possible phenomenon which we call magnetic limit-point instability, a state referring to the non-existence of an equilibrium state –either stable or unstable. In this work, we are concerned with such instabilities in an incompressible isotropic magnetoelastic toroidal membrane with an <b>initial</b> circular <b>cross-section.</b> A non-uniform magnetic field is generated using a circular current carrying loop placed inside the membrane in addition to inflation by a uniform hydrostatic pressure. An energy formulation based on magnetization is used to model the magneto-mechanical coupling along with a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model for the elastic strain energy density. Computations show that the magnetic field strongly influences the location of elastic limit points and in some cases can cause them to vanish. Multiple equilibrium states are obtained as solutions of the governing equations and a criterion based on second variation is employed to determine their stability. Existence and dependence of magnetic limit point on the magnetic field is demonstrated. While the quantitative results obtained here are specific to the toroidal geometry, the deformation behaviour can be generalised to any magnetoelastic membrane...|$|R

The transport properties are determined by the electronic structures of the wires and electrodes. We assumed a two-probe device with ZnO wire connected to two semi-infinite Au(001) electrodes. The <b>initial</b> hexagonal <b>cross-section</b> of ZnO was cut from a large wurtzite supercell along the [0001] c-direction.

The scattering region included a portion of the semi-infinite electrodes where all the screening effects take place. Therefore, the charge distribution of the electrodes corresponded to the bulk gold phase with a prescribed numerical accuracy. Figure 4 b shows a three-cell wire sandwiched between the electrodes, where each unit cell of ZnO consists of 20 O– and 20 Zn atoms (more details in the Additional file). This method was similar to those used in the literature for carbon and boron nitride nanotubes, and OPVn molecules[42 – 44], maintaining fixed distances to compare the transport properties of 1 D nanostructures with different lengths.|$|R

The present formulation does not use the concept of displacement; it considers position as the main variable of the problem. The strain determination is done directly from the proposed positional concept. A non-dimensional space is created and relative configurations are used to directly calculate the strain energy and its derivatives at general points. The initial configuration is assumed {{as the basis of}} calculation, i. e., Hooke’s law relates reference stress and engineering strain. Reissner kinematics is employed, i. e., <b>initial</b> plane <b>cross-sections</b> remain plane after deformation and angles are independent of the slope of the central line. This point of view is very precise as demonstrated in the example section where numerical results are compared with analytical solutions. A comparison between Reissner and Euler-Bernoulli kinematics is provided, where the influence of shear deformation on the analyzed problems is studied.

Introdution The analysis of structures that exhibit large deflections is of great importance in the current engineering. The increasing search for economy and optimal material application leads to the conception of very flexible structures.

Initial studies explored the interactions of the dodecanethiol passivated gold nanocluster, held in solution with toluene, and the native oxide covered silicon surface. Deposition of the clusters is achieved by pippetting #mu#-litre quantities of the solution onto the surface, and allowing the solvent to evaporate leaving the clusters as residue. Patterning of the surface with micron scale photoresist structures prior to cluster exposure, led to the selective aggregation of cluster deposits along the resist boundaries. An extension of this technique, examined the flow of the cluster solution along photoresist structures which extended beyond the solution droplet. Investigation into the electronic properties of nanocluster arrays generated non-linear current-voltage curves, which are explained in terms of two very simple models. These results cast doubt over the suitability of the lateral approach to nanocluster device fabrication, and led to the exploration of vertical device design. Vertical devices, based around #approx# 50 nm diameter silicon nanopillars with nanoclusters on top, afford the necessary level of control over all aspects of nanocluster positioning: deposition of a single cluster layer is confined laterally to the pillar <b>cross-section.</b> <b>Initial</b> results of vertical device fabrication, show the considerable promise of this approach to cluster based electronic systems.

40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model for non-linear static analysis of multilayer composite structures with deformable connection is presented. Doctoral thesis {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part a new {{mathematical model}} for analysis of plane multilayer frames is presented. Each layer of composite frame is modelled with geometrically exact Reissner model of plane beam. An important novelty of the model is the introduction of a new constitutive law for connection. Arbitrary non-linear relationship between stress vector and vector of displacement differences at the contact is described in the average base. This constitutive law presents a physically reasonable generalization of constitutitve laws known from linear models of two-layer beams which are described in spatial base. The basic system of non-linear equilibrium equations which represents mathematical model is solved by Galerkin's finite element method. A new family of strain-based finite elements is presented. A new numerical method for analysis of multilayer plane composite structures is very accurate and therefore suitable for analysis of stiffness, ductility, ultimate capacity and buckling capacity of different types of multilayer composite structures used in civil engineering. Detailed parametric study revealed that shear and transverse connection stiffness have a major effect on buckling capacity of composite columns. The effect of transverse connection is negligible comparing to the effect of shear connection in the case of bending of multilayer composite frames. The influence of transverse connection stiffness is negligible when composite beams are subjected to bending. The exact solution of buckling capacity of completly debonded elastic spatial beams with straight axis and pre-twisted beams is presented {{in the second part of}} the doctoral thesis. The solution is derived based on consistent linearization of Reissner-Simo's spatial beam model and the fact that critical points of linearized system of equations are equal to the critical points of corresponding non-linear system of equations. Parametric studies revealed that <b>initial</b> twist of <b>cross-sections,</b> length and position of delaminated parts have an important effect on buckling capacity of fully delaminated elastic spatial beams. The buckling capacity is higher in the case of twisted columns. ...|$|R
