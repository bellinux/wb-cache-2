50|$|An electrofax {{involved}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printer</b> and copier technology, {{where an}} image was formed {{directly on the}} paper, instead of first on a drum, then transferred to paper, {{as it would be}} in xerography. It was used in the United States from the 1950s through the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Iwatsu {{was seeking}} the third {{signature}} product following telephones and oscilloscopes. After {{years of research}} in Europe and the U.S., Iwatsu took notice of RCA's <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printer</b> and copier technology (electrofax). Iwatsu signed a patent license with RCA and began {{research and development of}} what was seemingly unrelated to Iwatsu's then-existing technologies. The idea behind this decision was that there wasn't much difference in terms of communications, whether electronic or on paper.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{hardware}} and software requirements are described for four low cost analysis systems for computer generated land use maps. The data analysis systems consist of an image display system, a small digital computer, and an output recording device. Software is described together {{with some of the}} display and recording devices, and typical costs are cited. Computer requirements are given, and two approaches are described for converting black-white film and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printer</b> output to inexpensive color output products. Examples of output products are shown...|$|E
50|$|Worldwide, most survey offices {{used this}} printer before color inkjet {{plotters}} become popular. Liquid ink <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers</b> were mostly available in 36 to 54 in width and also 6 color printing. These {{were also used}} to print large billboards. It was first introduced by Versatec, which was later bought by Xerox. 3M also used to make these printers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, this {{technology}} was first developed at RCA (Radio Corporation of America). Subsequently, many office machine companies, including SCM (Smith Corona Marchant), Savin, etc., introduced copiers that utilized this technology. Versatec was {{a brand of}} computer printers and plotters using this process; <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers</b> like the Versatec were important stepping-stones to later laser printers. Programs like vtroff, by Tom Ferrin at UCSF, consequently justified early more expensive laser printers.|$|R
50|$|Error Diffusion {{may also}} be used to produce output images with more than two levels (per channel, in the case of color images). This has {{application}} in displays and printers which can produce 4, 8, or 16 levels in each image plane, such as <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers</b> and displays in compact mobile telephones. Rather than use a single threshold to produce binary output, the closest permitted level is determined, and the error, if any, is diffused as described above.|$|R
5000|$|Liquid ink <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers</b> use a {{chemical}} coated paper, which is {{charged by the}} print head according {{to the image of}} the document. The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image. This process was developed from the process of electrostatic copying. Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than ±0.1%. (All laser printers have an accuracy of ±1%.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{high-speed}} {{motion of}} the paper often developed large <b>electrostatic</b> charges. Line <b>printers</b> frequently {{used a variety of}} discharge brushes and active (corona discharge-based) static eliminators to discharge these accumulated charges.|$|R
40|$|At least 20, 000, 000 {{people in}} the U. S. are afflicted by {{physical}} disabilities which interfere with their lives. The number and distribution of disabilities such as visual, hearing and mobility impairments is considered, to motivate an examination {{of a variety of}} computer aids for the handicapped. Computerized braille systems are found to be practical and cost-effective, and a variety of devices for embossing braille are described. Research in reading machines for the blind, using voice synthesizers, appears to be proceeding rapidly. The need for large print (large type) output has not generally been sufficiently emphasized, and the use of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers</b> is suggested as a possible output device. A computer-independent device, the Optacon, which provides tactile input to the blind is currently in use, and is especially helpful to blind programmers. The deaf use teletypewriters and acoustic couplers to communicate via the telephone network. Intelligent typewriters, and automated letter boards are practical alternative methods of communication for some people with motor impairments. Ignorance of the needs of the physically disabled can result in operating system designs which present barriers to them...|$|R
5000|$|One unusual {{peripheral}} offered was a [...] "Quick Printer", an <b>electrostatic</b> rotary <b>printer</b> that {{scanned the}} video memory {{through the same}} bus connector used for the expansion interface, and printed {{an image of the}} screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about a second. Unfortunately, it was incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the expansion interface, and with the [...] "heartbeat" [...] interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This could be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a [...] "dummy" [...] write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.|$|R
40|$|Documentation {{often is}} a primary {{residual}} of research and development. Because of this important role {{and because of the}} large amount of time consumed in generating technical reports, particularly those containing formulas and graphics, an existing data-processing computer system has been adapted so as to provide text-processing of technical documents. Emphasis has been on accuracy, turnaround time, and time savings for staff and secretaries, for the types of reports normally produced in the reactor development program. The computer-assisted text-processing system, called TXT, has been implemented to benefit primarily the originator of technical reports. The system is of particular value to professional staff, such as scientists and engineers, who have responsibility for generating much correspondence or lengthy, complex reports or manuscripts - especially if prompt turnaround and high accuracy are required. It can produce text that contains special Greek or mathematical symbols. Written in FORTRAN and MACRO, the program TXT operates on a PDP- 11 minicomputer under the RSX- 11 M multitask multiuser monitor. Peripheral hardware includes video terminals, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>printers,</b> and magnetic disks. Either data- or word-processing tasks may be performed at the terminals. The repertoire of operations has been restricted so as to minimize user training and memory burden. Secretarial staff may be readily trained to make corrections from annotated copy. Some examples of camera-ready copy are provided...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{requirement}} to acquire, process, and display telemetry data from increasingly sophisticated test vehicles {{in real time}} is one of the, principal parameters that shaped the SAMTEC Telemetry Integrated Processing System (TIPS) design. An integrated subsystem incorporating advances in hardware design, linked by a multi-processor software element implementing three distinct processing functions to fill this requirement, is described in this paper. Most of the hardware elements, except the processor, were {{designed to meet the}} specific requirements of this system. This includes telemetry front-end acquisition equipment, <b>electrostatic</b> high speed <b>printer</b> plotters, plasma keyboard displays, and wide band links to transfer data from element to element. The processors are 32 -bit word third generation midi-computers. Each element was selected or specified primarily for its ability to perform at the expected incoming data rates. The Real Time Acquisition (RTA) Software is partitioned into an executive function, an acquisition and event processing function, and a display processing function. Each function resides in its own specific computer configuration. The acquisition configuration (TPP) and display configuration (QLDA) are each replicated to provide multi-input stream and multiple independent display capabilities. Real time requirements, similar to those at SAMTEC, are evolving elsewhere. The hardware and software components described herein are easily adaptable to satisfy these requirements at a variety of other advanced telemetry data processing facilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this monograph {{is to provide a}} concise introduction to the dynamics of systems comprised of charged small-scale particles. Flowing, small-scale, particles ("particulates'') are ubiquitous in industrial processes and in the natural sciences. Applications include <b>electrostatic</b> copiers, inkjet <b>printers,</b> powder coating machines, etc., and a variety of manufacturing processes. Due to their small-scale size, external electromagnetic fields can be utilized to manipulate and control charged particulates in industrial processes in order to achieve results that are not possible by purely mechanical means alone. A unique feature of small-scale particulate flows is that they exhibit a strong sensitivity to interparticle near-field forces, leading to nonstandard particulate dynamics, agglomeration and cluster formation, which can strongly affect manufactured product quality. This monograph also provides an introduction to the mathematically-related topic of the dynamics of swarms of interacting objects, which has gained the attention of a number of scientific communities. In summary, the following topics are discussed in detail: (1) Dynamics of an individual charged particle,  (2) Dynamics of rigid clusters of charged particles, (3) Dynamics of flowing charged particles, (4) Dynamics of charged particle impact with electrified surfaces and (5) An introduction to the mechanistic modeling of swarms. The text {{can be viewed as a}} research monograph suitable for use in an upper division undergraduate or first year graduate course geared towards students in the applied sciences, mechanics and mathematics that have an interest in the analysis of particulate materials...|$|R
