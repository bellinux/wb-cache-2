40|$|Registered nurses {{providing}} telenursing triage {{and advice}} services record {{information on the}} medication related calls they handle. However the quality and consistency of these data were rarely examined. Our aim was to examine medication related calls made to the healthdirect advice service in November 2014, to assess their basic characteristics and how the data <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> influenced information collected and data consistency. Registered nurses selected the patient question type {{from a range of}} categories, and entered the medications involved in a free text field. Medication names were manually extracted from the free text fields. We also compared the selected patient question type with the free text description of the call, in order to gauge data consistency. Results showed that nurses provided patients with advice on medication-related queries in a timely matter (the median call duration of 9 minutes). From 1835 calls, we were able to identify and classify 2156 medications into 384 generic names. However, in 204 cases (11. 2 % of calls) no medication name was entered. A further 308 (15. 0 %) of the medication names entered were not identifiable. When we compared the selected patient question with the free text description of calls, we found that these were consistent in 63. 27 % of cases.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{manifold}} representation for human faces with pose variations is proposed. Our model consists of mappings between 3 D head angles and facial images separately represented {{in shape and}} texture, via sub-space models spanned by principal components (PCs). Explicit mappings to and from 3 D head angles are used as processes of pose estimation and transformation, respectively. Generalization capability to unknown head poses enables our model to continuously cover pose parameter space, providing high approximation accuracy. The feasibility of this model is evaluated {{in a number of}} experiments. We also propose a novel pose-invariant face recognition system using our model as the <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> for a gallery of known persons. Experimental results with 3 D facial models recorded by a Cyberware scanner show that our model provides a superior recognition performance against pose variations, and that texture synthesis process is carried out correctly. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies second-price auctions {{in which}} bidders make {{participation}} decisions sequentially in an exogenous order and participating bidders incur bidding costs. When bidders {{decide whether to}} participate or not, they know their own valuations as well as earlier biddersâ participation decisions. To analyze biddersâ participation and bidding decisions, we study equilibria in cutoff strategies with which a bidder participates and bids his valuation if his valuation exceeds a cutoff given his observation on earlier biddersâ participation. Focusing {{on the case of}} two bidders, we present two main results on comparative statics and revenue comparison. In the comparative statics analysis, we study the effects of a change in biddersâ characteristics on equilibrium cutoffs. In revenue comparison, we show that the considered sequential <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> yields lower revenue than the simultaneous entry counterpart. Finally, we discuss the difficulties in generalizing these two results for the case of more than two bidders...|$|E

Effects of Zoning on Retail <b>Entry</b> and <b>Format</b> Variety This paper investigates the impact of spatial zoning restrictions on retail market outcomes. We estimate a structural model of <b>entry,</b> location and <b>format</b> choice across a large number of markets in the presence of zoning restrictions. The paper contributes to the literature in three ways: First, the paper demonstrates that estimates of factors affecting market potential and competitive intensity in the extant literature on entry and location choice that do not account for zoning restrictions are significantly biased. Second, the cross-market variations in zoning regulations helps us test and provide evidence for the theory that constraints on spatial differentiation will lead to greater product differentiation. Finally, we provide qualitative insight on how zoning impacts retail <b>entry</b> and <b>format</b> variety; in particular we evaluate the impact of prototypical zoning arrangements such as âcentralized, â âneighborhood, â an...|$|R

In this paper, we offer an alternative perspective on the integration of data from multiple sources such as traditional databases and semi-structured data sources on the Web. We observe that a lot of work on the integration of heterogenous data sources assume that the data is correct and complete. However, "dirty" data files are prevalent as a result of incorrect or missing data values due to data entry errors or typographical errors, inconsistent value naming conventions due to different field <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> and use of abbreviations, data value conflicts due to domain mismatch and incomplete information due to unavailability of data.

40|$|Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems {{have been}} adopted by {{healthcare}} organizations for do-cumentation of patient care. Often these information systems are embedded in mobile nurse sta-tions. As part of assessing {{the impact of this}} technology it is important to determine the effect it has on charting compliance and user acceptance. Data were collected at a medical center in Tai-wan in two stages. The first stage involved use of a 28 -item medical review tool to measure chart-ing compliance in 99 charts before and after implementation of the EHR system. In stage two, a survey was conducted with 709 nurse users to determine their level of mobile EHR acceptance 3 months after this documentation technology was initiated. Results demonstrated that EHR signif-icantly improved documentation compliance in standardized data <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> (name, date, time), abbreviation, content correction/revision, patient care needs, and care goals.

40|$|This paper first deploys a {{simplified}} accounting matrix {{to illustrate the}} concepts to be used. It will argue that macroeconomic analysis is facilitated if the main income and expenditure variables which make up the GDP are arranged in a double <b>entry</b> <b>format</b> {{so that they can}} all be seen as transactions involving at least two parties. Such a framework shows how the gap between each sectorâs receipts and outlays implies an equivalent rise or fall in its net acquisition of financial assets. One conclusion will be that financial balances (relative to income flows) must stay within certain limits if debts are not to grow excessively, implying that the monitoring of these balances may yield a warning that unsustainable processes are at work, with strategic implications for the conduct of policy. Furthermore, the fact that the net acquisition of financial assets by any one sector necessarily implies an equivalent change in the opposite direction in the sum of net acquisition by other sectors, has strong implications for the way in which targets for public borrowing should be set. The main conclusions will be illustrated using US and UK data...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to aid our {{understanding}} of the emergence of accounting as a control instrument in complex proto-industrial settings, through its perceived capacity of mirroring the production process. The paper starts off from an archival document, the 1586 deliberation by the Venetian Senate, which imposed on the Arsenal a stocktaking to be conducted every three years, and ad hoc galley production accounts to be kept in double <b>entry</b> <b>format,</b> where the passage of materials and work-in-process between units were recorded both in physical quantity and value. In this deliberation the Venetian Senate was clearly posing explicitly the problem of costing and the efficient use of resources within the Arsenal. Until then, the Senate controlled this organisation only by limiting the funds allocated to activities (wages, oars, 'stuffs') without entering into the substance of the operations. Two interrelated investigations are carried out. First, a content analysis of the 1586 document is made. Second, the question of its 'impact' on the Arsenal's actual accounting practices is addressed. In a 1633 Report by Alvise Molin, a magistrate of the Republic, some elements of the 1586 deliberation seem to surface, insofar as a quite sophisticated calculation of the production costs of galleys is provided. In this sense it might well be that the notion of cost emerged as a sort of 'accidental by-product' of the Senate's efforts aimed at introducing tighter forms of control on the Arsenal.
