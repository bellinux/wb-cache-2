40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} {{investigate}} content analysis of diagrammatic representations in upper primary science textbooks based on diagrammatic typology. The study analyzed the distribution of diagrams in different upper primary science book categories. The sample selected consists of a total number of nine 7 th grade physics, chemistry and biology textbooks adopted in three Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (I. C. S. E) schools in the Allahabad, India. Content analysis in this research entails a systematic coding and categorizing of the diagrams, drawings, photos, charts and graphs appeared in upper primary school science textbooks. A great amount of diagrams have been used in the upper primary level of science teaching. On average, there are about 1. 20 diagrams in physics, 0. 80 <b>diagrams</b> in <b>chemistry</b> & 1. 06 diagrams in biology textbooks used per page for the purposes of explaining, presenting or evaluating the scientific domain. The results confirmed that upper primary level of science education demands large quantity of diagrams to facilitate students learning. So content analysis of diagrammatic representations of science textbooks is recommended and teachers should adopt such diagrammatic strategies which increase the level of knowledge of learners. Teachers should teach students through different diagrammatic representations skills and to enhance their academic performance...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{causes of}} {{geothermal}} plant failures are obvious when they occur [...] the pipe or heat exchanger has holes in it, {{the lines are}} plugged or the injection well will not accept waste brine. The problem {{that led to the}} failure is often not obvious, and without any data recording it may not be possible to determine how the problem developed. In many cases these types of failures in hydrothermal power plants have caused multimillion dollar repair costs and extensive down time. In addition to financial losses (over $ 100, 000 /day for a 55 MWe plant), these failures cause doubts about the economic viability of geothermal power. In general, the causes of silica, calcite, and sulfide scaling are understood (attached diagrams). Scaling results from operating choices made by the plant designer or operator who has occasionally treated plant design as working with distilled water rather than ''rock soup''. Scale control involves understanding the behavior of minor elements in the brine, especially silica, calcium, and CO{sub 2 } and their interactions with brine temperature, pressure and time after production. In the attached <b>diagram</b> the <b>chemistry</b> of two wells at Cerro Prieto is given; one scales up and one does not. The reason is related to the interaction of CO{sub 2 } contents and steam separator operating pressures. Uniform corrosion of carbon steel is also understood. Usually corrosion results from acidic (pH < 7) conditions or man-made air intrusions and {{the presence or absence of}} protective films on the metal. The monitoring instruments developed and tested with this program include: (1) corrosion rate meters for brine, isobutane and cooling water; (2) electrode less conductivity to monitor brine quality and detect gases; (3) redox meter to detect air intrusions; (4) pH meter to monitor acidity which is related to both corrosion and scaling; (5) suspended particle meter to monitor solids that could plug injection well; (6) CO{sub 2 } sensor for brine; and (7) leak detectors for the Heber plant. Plans for FY 84 and the instruments still funded are discussed...|$|R
30|$|To {{achieve a}} better {{understanding}} of the nature of the factors influencing groundwater composition as well as to specify them quantitatively, conventional graphical and multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis) were applied on hydrochemical data consisting of 51 groundwater samples collected from domestic boreholes in Yenagoa city, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. The mode of study includes analysis of major ion contents and other chemical parameters such as pH, total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity of the groundwater samples. The PCA yielded three principal components explaining 78.38  % of the total variance of the 11 parameters. The three components are interpreted as controlled by the natural weathering of existing silicate rocks, reverse ion-exchange processes and oxidation reactions which are further supported by the scatter diagrams, ionic signatures and mechanisms controlling the water <b>chemistry</b> <b>diagrams</b> as the common factors influencing the groundwater hydrogeochemical character. Limited anthropogenic influence on the groundwater composition has also been noticed in the study area. The groundwater poses no threat to human health because the concentrations of physico-chemical parameters that can be used to evaluate drinking water quality are within World Health Organisation standard specification. The groundwater in the area is fresh, high salinity and low sodium in nature.|$|R
40|$|Chemists {{often use}} {{hand-drawn}} structural diagrams {{to capture and}} communicate ideas about organic compounds. However, the software available today for specifying these structures to a computer relies on a traditional mouse and keyboard interface, {{and as a result}} lacks the ease of use, naturalness, and speed of drawing on paper. In response, we have developed a novel sketch-based system capable of interpreting handdrawn organic <b>chemistry</b> <b>diagrams,</b> allowing users to draw molecules with a pen-based input device {{in much the same way}} that they would on paper. The system’s ability to interpret a sketch is based on knowledge about both chemistry and chemical drawing conventions. The system employs a trainable symbol recognizer incorporating both feature-based and image-based methods to locate and identify symbols in the sketch. Analysis of the spatial context around each symbol allows the system to choose among competing interpretations and determine an initial structure for the molecule. Finally, knowledge of chemistry (in particular chemical valence) enables the system to check the validity of its interpretation and, when necessary, refine it to recover from inconsistencies. We demonstrate that the system is capable of recognizing diagrams of common organic molecules and show that using domain knowledge produces a noticeable improvement in recognition accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{are a few}} of the most interesting pictures from continued work on the hot springs of Viterbo, mostly done since the original papers (Folk, 1993; 1994) with many partners in the field and at the SEM. They should reinforce the nannobacterial story on the precipitation of carbonate minerals. Fig. 1 shows a hot spring orifice at Le Zitelle, Viterbo; type locality for the first discovery of nannobacteria in geology. Fig. 2 <b>diagrams</b> the <b>chemistry</b> of the emergent waters – over 500 ppm Ca, with a lot of HCO 3 and SO 4 (data of Malesani and Vanucci). In a nearby spring (fig. 3, Bagnaccio) a long traverse down an outflow trench shows the rapid change in water chemistry downstream. Temperature (red triangles) drops from 60 ° to 30 ° in the terminal pools; while pH (blue hexagons) rises from slightly acid 6. 5 to over 7. 6 as CO 2 degasses. For the first few meters, there is abundant outgassing of H 2 S (stinks!) then it gradually oxidizes to sulfate. At first the water is too acid for CaCO 3 to precipitate; later, at such high temperatures (56 - 60 °C) aragonite begins to form abundantly. Where filamentous S-bacteria especially flourish, their slimy mucus slows the precipitation rate and calcite forms instead of aragonite. In the carbonate sediment in the bottom of the trench the sulfur content shows mm-scale variation with depth, as shown by inserting a silver dollar (fig. 4). Fig. 5 is a typical view of the fibrous mat formed by salmon-colored sulfur bacterial filaments, like streamers of hair. The carbonate is mainly aragonite with some calcite (fig. 6); the aragonite forms as radial needles encrusting bacterial filaments like a pipe-cleaner. Another common form is as fuzzy dumbbells (fig. 7; Pursell, 1985; Folk & Bendig, 1987); recently examined in detail by Corley (2009). My colleague at Mississippi State, Dr. Brenda Kirkland, prepared samples for TEM study (fig. 8), in which acid removes all the aragonite mineral (thus white in the photo), and Osmium stains organic matter black. One can easily see that the central part of the dumbbells is very rich in organic material (I think nannobacterial cells), while the outer parts are relatively free...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 19 Published under CC BY 3. 0 license Available from: [URL] audienceA phase <b>diagram</b> in {{physical}} <b>chemistry</b> and chemical engineering is a graphical representation showing distinct phases {{which are in}} thermodynamic equilibrium. Since these equilibrium relationships are dependent on the pressure, temperature, and composition of the system, a phase diagram provides a graphical visualization {{of the effects of}} these system variables on the equilbrium behavior between the phases. Phase diagrams are essential in the understanding and development of separation processes, especially in the choice and design of separation unit operations, e. g. knowledge about high pressure phase equilibria is essential not just in chemical processes and separation operations, but is also important for the simulation of petroleum reservoirs, the transportation of petroleum fluids, {{as well as in the}} refrigeration industry. In order to utilize the knowledge of phase behavior it is important to represent or correlate the phase information via the most accurate thermodynamic models. Thermodynamic models enable a mathematical representation of the phase diagram which ensures comprehensive and reproducible production of phase diagrams. The measurement of phase equilibrium data is necessary to develop and refine thermodynamic models, as well as to adjust them by fitting or correlating their parameters to experimental data. Generally the measurement of phase equilibria is undertaken using two categories of experimental techniques, viz. synthetic and analytic methods. The choice of the technique depends on the type of data to be determined, the range of temperatures and pressures, the precision required, and also the order of magnitude of the phase concentrations expected...|$|R
40|$|Rocks {{analyzed}} by the Curiosity rover in Gale crater include {{a variety of}} clastic sedimentary rocks and igneous float rocks transported by fluvial and impact processes. To facilitate {{the discussion of the}} range of lithologies, we present in this article a petrological classification framework adapting terrestrial classification schemes to Mars compositions (such as Fe abundances typically higher than for comparable lithologies on Earth), to specific Curiosity observations (such as common alkali-rich rocks), and to the capabilities of the rover instruments. Mineralogy was acquired only locally for a few drilled rocks, and so it does not suffice as a systematic classification tool, in contrast to classical terrestrial rock classification. The core of this classification involves (1) the characterization of rock texture as sedimentary, igneous or undefined according to grain/crystal sizes and shapes using imaging from the ChemCam Remote Micro-Imager (RMI), Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) and Mastcam instruments, and (2) the assignment of geochemical modifiers based on the abundances of Fe, Si, alkali, and S determined by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and ChemCam instruments. The aims are to help understand Gale crater geology by highlighting the various categories of rocks {{analyzed by}} the rover. Several implications are proposed from the cross-comparisons of rocks of various texture and composition, for instance between in place outcrops and float rocks. All outcrops analyzed by the rover are sedimentary; no igneous outcrops have been observed. However, some igneous rocks are clasts in conglomerates, suggesting that part of them are derived from the crater rim. The compositions of in-place sedimentary rocks contrast significantly with the compositions of igneous float rocks. While some of the differences between sedimentary rocks and igneous floats may be related to physical sorting and diagenesis of the sediments, some of the sedimentary rocks (e. g., potassic rocks) cannot be paired with any igneous rocks analyzed so far. In contrast, many float rocks, which cannot be classified from their poorly defined texture, plot on <b>chemistry</b> <b>diagrams</b> close to float rocks defined as igneous from their textures, potentially constraining their nature...|$|R
5000|$|Determining the {{thermodynamic}} {{state of}} the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model. Under a perfect gas model, the ratio of specific heats (also called [...] "isentropic exponent", adiabatic index, [...] "gamma" [...] or [...] "kappa") {{is assumed to be}} constant along with the gas constant. For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature. Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the isentropic chain. For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a Mollier diagram would be used instead for manual calculation. However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier <b>diagram)</b> or a <b>chemistry</b> based thermodynamics program. The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the Gibbs free energy method. Gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature. A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations. The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a Newton-Raphson method is the usual numerical scheme). The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions. Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed [...] "NASA Glenn Research Center"). Other names for CEA are the [...] "Gordon and McBride Code" [...] and the [...] "Lewis Code". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K (double ionization is not modelled). CEA can be downloaded from the Internet along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the G77 Fortran compiler.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fire {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} modulator factors of the environment and the forest. It is able to induce chemical and biological shifts and these, in turn, can alter the physical properties of soil. Generally, fire affects the most reactive fraction, soil organic matter (SOM) (González-Pérez et al., 2004) resulting in changes to several soil properties and functions. To study changes in SOM following a wildfire, researchers can count on several traditional as well as new analytical techniques. One of the most recently employed techniques is Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). This new powerful ultra-high resolution mass spectral technique, together with graphic interpretation tools such as van Krevelen diagrams (Kim et al, 2003), may be used to shed light on alterations caused by the burning of SOM. The objective of this research is to study fire impacts on SOM, using a sandy soil collected under a Cork oak (Quercus suber) in Doñana National Park, Southwest Spain. that was affected by a wildfire in August 2012. Methods: The impact of fire on SOM was studied in various different sieve fractions (coarse, 1 - 2 mm, and fine, < 0. 05 mm) collected in a burned area and an adjacent unburned control site with the same physiographic conditions. Alkaline extracts of SOM from each soil sample were examined using a Bruker Daltonics 12 Tesla Apex Qe FT-ICR-MS equipped with an Apollo II ESI ion source (operating in negative ion mode). The ESI voltages were optimized for each sample, and all spectra were internally calibrated following the procedure of (Sleighter and Hatcher, 2007), after which, peaks were assigned unique molecular formulas using a MatLab script written in house by Dr. Wassim Obeid of Old Dominion University. Results: The van Krevelen diagrams together with the relative intensity of each chemical compound, both obtained by FT-ICR-MS, allowed us to assess SOM quality for each sample and size fractions. The chemical compounds were grouped into the 7 main families; condensed aromatic compounds, unspecific aromatics, tannins, lignin, lipids, protein and carbohydrate derived. The unburnt SOM in the coarse fraction was mainly composed of compounds with a high intensity in the tannin-like, lignin-like and carbohydrate-like regions of the van Krevelen diagram, whereas the SOM in the fine fraction showed a high intensity in the lipid-like and protein-like regions. These results suggest that the SOM in the coarse fraction was less altered than that of the fine fraction; the latter believed to be subjected to higher microbial activity. We suggest that the observed changes occurs via a methylation process, producing a SOM that is highly humified (Jiménez-Morillo et al., 2014). The SOM in the coarse fraction affected by fire, showed a high relative intensity of chemical compounds in the carbohydrate-like and lignin-like regions, indicating the input of fresh organic matter. The presence of molecular formulas which plot in the aromatic and condensed aromatics regions also indicates that this fraction may have contributions from a second, more recalcitrant, organic carbon pool. The appearance of aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds could suggest that, in this fraction the fire induced condensation processes. In the burnt fine fraction, two different SOM sources of alteration could be identified; i) from microbial origin with high relative intensity of lipid-like and protein-like compounds and ii) fire origin with large amounts of condensed aromatic compounds and a high contribution from the carbohydrate-like compounds region. We suggest that these results indicate both, condensation processes yielding black carbon like materials and additions from the coarse fraction during fire mediated distillation process.
