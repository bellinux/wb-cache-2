25|$|Britain {{realised}} {{the value}} of troops from the Australian colonies. The climates and geography of Southern Africa and Australia were quite similar, and most Australian soldiers, {{the vast majority of}} whom were trained as mounted rifles, were well-suited to operating in such terrain. Britain was also quick to understand the need for further horsemen, as the Boers operated with a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> across the Southern African grasslands, often referred to romantically as 'the vastness of the veldt'. At that time, most British troops were recruited from within urban environments, and although their ability as soldiers was not questioned, they did not have the natural horsemanship and bush craft of the Australians, many of whom came from rural backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|Although a city, Sheffield is informally {{known as}} [...] "the largest village in England", {{because of a}} {{combination}} of topographical isolation and demographic stability.

The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use, and now includes several protected green belt areas.

40|$|Abstract. The paper treats hybrid {{manipulators}} comprising {{a serial}} anthropomorphic kinematic chain and redundant number of parallel actuating kinematic chains for linear displacements. The manipulator stiffness {{is presented in}} the study, {{as a function of the}} redundant actuating forces. Schemes for manipulator control are outlined, based on the antagonistic stiffness. To apply those schemes, approaches of generating the compliance admissible bounds are proposed. Computer simulations are performed and the results are graphically illustrated. It is essential that manipulators have inputs whose number is larger than the necessary minimum to effectively execution of complex tasks in complex environment [1]. If manipulator possesses <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> whose number is larger than the dimensions of the task space, such a redundancy is called “kinematic redundancy”. On the other hand, when the number of the actuators is larger than that <b>of</b> the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility,</b> the redundancy is called “actuatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract While extreme {{mobility}} and ensconced sedentism {{can be easily}} distinguished in the archeological record, effective means are lacking <b>of</b> discrimi-nating between <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> that may range from seasonal shifts by farmers to recurrent moves across the landscape {{as a way of}} life. Fortunately, site layout and the way space is used are related to expectations regarding length of stay, and though they are not quantifiable measures, they provide linkages between the active and material realms. Short stays elicit a search for distinctive characteristics of a place rather than investing in the modification of a place. The quest for suitable spaces is a matter of fact among mobile groups, whereas sedentary groups, or those expecting to stay in one place for an extended period, tend to build their environment to suit their needs, even formalizing spaces in consistent ways from place to place. By understanding the ramifications of these concepts it is possible to distinguish between differing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> groups occupying similar environmental zones in the southern portion of the American Southwest in the protohistoric and early historic periods and to apply these to wider contexts...|$|R

2500|$|A 2005 study {{analyzed}} the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a worldwide range of equids, from 53,000-year-old fossils to contemporary horses. Their analysis placed all equids {{into a single}} clade, or group with a single common ancestor, consisting of three genetically divergent species: Hippidion, the New World stilt-legged horse, and the true horse. The true horse, which ranged from western Europe to eastern Beringia, included prehistoric horses and the Przewalski's Horse, {{as well as what}} is now the modern domestic horse, belonged to a single Holarctic species. A more detailed analysis of the true horses grouped them into two major clades. One of these clades, which seemed to have been restricted to North America, is now extinct. [...] The other clade was broadly distributed from North America to central Europe, north and south of Pleistocene ice sheets. It became extinct in Beringia around 14,200 years ago, and {{in the rest of the}} Americas around 10,000 years ago. This clade survived in Eurasia, however, and it is from these horses which all domestic horses appear to have descended. These horses showed little phylogeographic structure, probably reflecting their high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and adaptability.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{dynamics}} of national saving-investment relationship in order to determine the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility</b> in 12 Latin American countries.

Of special interest is the speed at which variables return to the long run equilibrium relationship, which is interpreted as being negatively related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility.</b> The long run correlation, in turn, captures the coefficient implied by the solvency constraint. We find that heterogeneity and cross-section dependence completely change the estimation of the long run coefficient. Besides we obtain a more precise short run coefficient estimate compared to the existent estimates in the literature. There is evidence <b>of</b> an intermediate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility,</b> and the coefficients are extremely stable over time...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{macroeconomic}} stability in a simple dynamic open economy model, in which monetary authorities adopt an flexible inflation-targeting regime in an environment with a liberalised capital account and flexible exchange rates.

We show that a low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> inflation targeting flexibility (i. e., central bank�s response is aggressive toward inflation) with a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility</b> implies a dynamically unstable solution in this simple rational expectations model. In contrast, when central bank adopts a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> inflation-targeting flexibility (accommodative central bank), stability can be ensured under any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility.</b> Finally, under low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> inflation targeting flexibility, it seems necessary to limit the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>mobility</b> in order to maintain stability in countries opening their economies to international capital flows, mainly in emerging market and transition economies. ...|$|R
