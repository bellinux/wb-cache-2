40|$|The {{production}} of integrated circuits (IC's) involves {{a number of}} discrete steps which utilize hazardous or regulated solvents and generate large waste streams. ES&H considerations associated with these chemicals have prompted a search for alternative, more environmentally benign solvent systems. An emerging technology for conventional solvent replacement {{is the use of}} supercritical fluids based on carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). Research work, conducted at Los Alamos in conjunction with the Hewlett-Packard Company, has lead {{to the development of a}} CO{sub 2 }-based supercritical <b>fluid</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> for the stripping of hard-baked photoresists. This treatment system, known as Supercritical CO{sub 2 } Resist Remover, or CORR, uses a two-component solvent composed of a nonhazardous, non-regulated compound, dissolved in supercritical CO{sub 2 }. The solvent/treatment system has been successfully tested on metallized Si wafers coated with negative and positive photoresist, the latter both before and after ion-implantation. A description of the experimental data will be presented. Based on the initial laboratory results, the project has progressed to the design and construction of prototype, single-wafer photoresist-stripping equipment. The integrated system involves a closed-loop, recirculating cycle which continuously cleans and regenerates the CO{sub 2 }, recycles the dissolved solvent, and separates and concentrates the spent resist. The status of the current design and implementation strategy of a treatment system to existing IC fabrication facilities will be discussed. Additional remarks will be made on the use of a SCORR-type system for the cleaning of wafers prior to processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of integrated circuits (IC) involves {{a number of}} discrete steps which utilize hazardous or regulated solvents. Environmental, safety and health considerations associated with these chemicals have prompted a search for alternative, more environmentally-benign solvent systems. An emerging technology for conventional solvent replacement {{is the use of}} supercritical fluids based on carbon dioxide (CO 2). In this paper, we will first describe the general properties of supercritical fluids, with particular emphasis on their application as alternative solvents. Next, we review the literature results on the possible application of supercritical fluids to several semiconductor processing operations, including the cleaning of silicon wafers, metal deposition, etching, photoresist removal, and waste treatment. Finally, we will describe our recent results on the application of supercritical CO 2 (SCCO 2) based fluids to a particular semiconductor processing operation: The stripping of hard-baked photoresists. Current techniques for hard-baked photoresist removal require the use of highly acidic, highly alkaline or organic solvent systems. We have developed a treatment system, which uses a non-hazardous, non-regulated solvent dissolved in supercritical SCCO 2. This system has been sucessfully demonstrated on metallized Si wafers coated with positive-tone photoresists both before and after ion-implantation. Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) performed on these samples, after the supercritical fluid stripping treatment, was used to verify that the photoresist was effectively removed, while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that the treatment process has no detrimental effects on metallizations. These results indicate that the new treatment method is fully compatible with existing IC fabrication processes. Experimental results of the supercritical <b>fluid</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> will be presented, and the design and implementation to existing IC fabrication facilities will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{molecular}} mixing (as opposed to molecular-collision transport) in {{the description of}} turbulent diffusion in continuum framework is examined. This is done by comparing a new virtual <b>fluid</b> parcel <b>treatment</b> with the classical <b>fluid</b> particle <b>treatment</b> of the BMDFE (Basic Macroscopically Describable Fluid Element). It is found that the classical <b>fluid</b> particle <b>treatment</b> conceptually excludes molecular mixing between different BMDFEs, due to its postulated constraint that individual BMDFEs maintain their integrities in motion. The new virtual <b>fluid</b> parcel <b>treatment,</b> on the other hand, conceptually incorporates molecular mixing between different BMDFEs, by relaxing this constraint to permit disintegration of individual BMDFEs. The main improvement made by the new virtual <b>fluid</b> parcel <b>treatment</b> lies in the introduction of a feedback mechanism in the form of physically coupled disintegration and integration of the BMDFEs. This improvement suggests that molecular mixing is a controlling agent of the mixing mechanism in every time-step of turbulent diffusion, whose significance would increase cumulatively. By applying the two treatments to the evolution of the diffusion cloud on the level of single time-step diffusion redistribution, it is shown that molecular mixing persistently and cumulatively influences the evolution of the diffusion cloud by reducing the diffusion distribution variance. This indicates that the exclusion {{of molecular}} mixing in the classical <b>fluid</b> particle <b>treatment</b> would lead to a potential mathematical-physical inconsistency {{in the description of}} turbulent diffusion by exaggerating the diffusion distribution variance. The results of this analysis are qualitatively supported by experiments of passive scalar diffusion in water flow with moderate turbulence intensity.

These systems performed efficiently with varied inflow simulations of FGD wastewaters removing As, Hg, and Se concentrations below NPDES permit levels and reducing the toxicity of simulated FGD wastewater after treatment with the constructed wetland <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Sequential extraction procedures indicated that these elements (As, Hg, and Se) were bound to residual phases within sediments of these systems, which should limit their bioavailability to aquatic biota.

We tested whether supplemental fluid and supplemental oxygen can increase tissue oxygen tension in healthy and injured, perianastomotic, and anastomotic colon in an acutely instrumented pig model of anastomosis surgery. METHODS: Sixteen Swiss Landrace pigs were anesthetized (isoflurane 0. 8 %- 1 %) and their lungs ventilated. The animals were randomly assigned to low <b>fluid</b> <b>treatment</b> ("low" group, 3 mL x kg(- 1) x h(- 1) lactated Ringer's solution) or high <b>fluid</b> <b>treatment</b> ("high" group, 10 mL/kg bolus, 18 mL x kg(- 1) x h(- 1) lactated Ringer's solution) during colon anastomosis surgery and a subsequent measurement period (4 h). Two-and-half hours after surgery, tissue oxygen tension was recorded for 30 min during ventilation with 30 % oxygen. Three hours after surgery, the animals' lungs were ventilated with 100 % oxygen for 60 min. Tissue oxygen tension was recorded in the last 30 min. Tissue oxygen tension was measured with polarographic Clark-type electrodes, positioned in healthy colonic wall, close (2 cm) to the anastomosis, and in the anastomosis. RESULTS: In every group, tissue oxygen tension during ventilation with 100 % oxygen was approximately twice as high as during ventilation with 30 % oxygen, a statistically significant result.
