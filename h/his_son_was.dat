5|$|After the {{disappearance}} of Olubei from the scene ca. 1458, no princes are known by name until Isaac in 1465, possibly Olubei's son. Isaac was overthrown in 1475 by his brother Alexander due to his pro-Ottoman stance. His reign was brief, as the Ottoman Empire laid siege and conquered Theodoro itself in December. Alexander {{and his family were}} taken captive to Constantinople, where the prince was beheaded, <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> forcibly converted to Islam, and his wife and daughters became part of the Sultan's harem.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was {{travelling}} in England. Cotton secured {{for him a}} {{place in}} Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince. He left England for India, arriving there in February 1893. In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive <b>his</b> <b>son,</b> <b>was</b> misinformed by his agents from Bombay (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk {{off the coast of}} Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.|$|E
5|$|Evers married Helen Fitzgibbons. His son, John J. Evers, Jr., {{served as}} a Lieutenant in World War II, {{assigned}} to the Pacific Theater of Operations.

5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> also {{executed}} {{a few months}} later, and his daughter-in-law suffered for several months in prison before she was released {{in the summer of}} 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.|$|E

5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared that <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E
5|$|John Martin Scripps {{was born}} in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, 9 December 1959 to Leonard and Jean Scripps, an East End lorry driver and a Fleet Street barmaid respectively. He {{travelled}} often in childhood, occasionally accompanied by his father, with whom he was very close. Leonard Scripps committed suicide when <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> nine. After his father's death, Scripps developed problems with reading and writing, which led to him leaving school {{at the age of}} 15. After dropping out of school he continued to travel, raising money for his trips by doing odd jobs and selling antiques.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E

5|$|Pahing, who {{had grown}} up within the nascent {{independence}} movement and associated with several historical figures, was arrested for being half-Dutch by the Japanese spy Maruyama (Verdi Solaiman)– a man who coveted Pahing's wife.

Pahing later died on a flight carrying medical supplies over Yogyakarta when the flight was shot down. Meanwhile, <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> raised by Maruyama– the kidnapper– and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin.|$|E

5|$|The loss of <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>was</b> a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over {{the years he}} had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son. With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E
