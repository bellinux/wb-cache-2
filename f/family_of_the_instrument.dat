50|$|A tenor violin (or tenor viola) is an {{instrument}} {{with a range}} between those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cello and the viola. An earlier development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violin <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is not standard in the modern symphony orchestra. Its tuning, typically G2-D3-A3-E4 - an octave below the traditional violin, places the range between the cello and viola and thus is sometimes confused with the modern baritone violin which has the same tuning on the standard violin body. As a formal development, the 17th-century tenor violin existed as {{an instrument}} with a body larger than a viola but with a short neck. In earlier designs, the tenor was played upright in the musician's lap. Tenor violin parts were written in tenor clef (4th line C-clef).|$|R

5000|$|The title Parthenia {{comes from}} the Greek parthenos meaning [...] "maiden" [...] or [...] "virgin." [...] The music is written for the Virginals, <b>the</b> {{etymology}} <b>of</b> which is unknown, but may either refer to the young girls who are often shown playing it, or from the Latin virga, which means [...] "stick" [...] or [...] "wand", possibly referring to part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanism that plucks a string in <b>the</b> harpsichord <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "Maydenhead" [...] refers to the maiden voyage or, in this case, <b>the</b> first printing <b>of</b> Parthenia. <b>The</b> manuscript's dedication by the publisher William Hole (first edition) opens with the phrase: The virgin PARTHENIA (whilst yet I may) I offer up to your virgin Highnesses.|$|R
5000|$|The piccolo [...] ( [...] ; Italian for [...] "small", but named ottavino in Italy) is a {{half-size}} flute, and {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodwind <b>family</b> <b>of</b> musical <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> modern piccolo has most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written.

5000|$|Timbre is {{the quality}} that gives the {{listener}} the ability to distinguish between <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> different <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> timbre <b>of</b> an <b>instrument</b> is determined by which overtones it emphasizes. That is to say, <b>the</b> relative volumes <b>of</b> these overtones to each other determines the specific [...] "flavor" [...] or [...] "color" [...] of sound <b>of</b> that <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> each of these overtones is rarely constant for <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> a note. Over time, different overtones may decay at different rates, causing <b>the</b> relative intensity <b>of</b> each overtone to rise or fall independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound. A carefully trained ear can hear these changes even in a single note. This is why <b>the</b> timbre <b>of</b> a note may be perceived differently when played staccato or legato.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> {{currently}} used in most classical music were largely invented before {{the mid-19th century}} (often much earlier) and codified in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> found in an orchestra or in a concert band, together with several other solo <b>instruments</b> (such as <b>the</b> piano, harpsichord, and organ). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string, woodwind, brass, and percussion <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> concert band consists <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass <b>instruments</b> than <b>the</b> orchestra but {{does not have a}} string section. However, many concert bands use a double bass. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, polyphonic choral works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> was {{especially}} {{popular in the}} late 17th century, although a specialised viola d'amore player would have been highly unusual, since it was customary for professional musicians to play a number <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> especially within <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musician's main <b>instrument.</b> Later, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> fell from use, as the volume and power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violin <b>family</b> became preferred over the delicacy and sweetness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viol <b>family.</b> However, there has been renewed interest in the viola d'amore in the last century.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{satellite}} missions have marked <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical remote sensing, providing a wide choice of products for {{every kind of}} application and investigation. The Proba- 1 program can not be compared in importance and budget to very important missions like Landsat and SPOT, but the innovations introduced in the payload design have attracted <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> principal investigators and scientists since the beginning. The new spectral configuration of its high resolution sensor CHRIS can represent an innovation for <b>the</b> wide <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical <b>instruments.</b> In fact CHRIS is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments, as well as NASA Hyperion, concerning <b>the</b> developing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expensive hyperspectral technology for the satellite environment. Moreover, the innovative solutions for the autonomous orbit maintaining and navigation, permit to the spacecraft difficult manoeuvres and multi-angular acquisitions during the target overpass. The result is an extraordinary and unique database of hyperspectral and multi-directional images acquired {{several times during the}} years over predefined test sites. This research work proposes a complete treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CHRIS products since the radiometric and geometric correction till the classification processing. Phases like destriping, atmospheric corrections, spectral adjacency compensation and ortho-rectification have been performed and developed. Several classification exercises have been proposed with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal key factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Proba mission (hyperspectral, multi-angular and multi-temporal) to the final classification accuracy. <b>The</b> directional anisotropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refiectance, as well as its temporal dependence, has been well explained and investigated trough <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> spectral models and radiative equations, but studies and applications based on real satellite high resolution and multi-directional data over lands and water bodies are few or still ongoing. Said that, this research work has been addressed to asses if these additional information, which reflect additional costs in terms of satellite technology and image processing are justified with significant improvements for the land cover production, as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most diffused application in the research environment. Once again the neural networks have confirmed their effectiveness for <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> optical images at high and very high resolution.

40|$|Adolphe Sax {{developed}} in Paris {{in the early}} 1840 s a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> brass <b>instruments,</b> <b>the</b> saxhorns, which gained an immediate popularity in France, Britain and other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> originality <b>of</b> saxhorns was challenged at the time through long-lasting litigations, and is still questioned by many researchers. This thesis investigates <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saxhorn from an organological standpoint. Saxhorns are examined in comparison to instruments predating them by other makers, along with relevant archival material (patents, lawsuit minutes, daily press, publicity material etc.) so as to reveal whether the allegations against their originality were sound. It is noticed that idiosyncrasies of intellectual property law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time facilitated a strong interaction between musical instrument makers particularly of France and Britain. Instruments examined are Adolphe Sax saxhorns, saxhorns by other contemporary makers, mainly French and British, but not exclusively, {{as well as a}} number of related instruments, made before and after <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> Sax‚Äôs saxhorns. <b>The</b> assertions <b>of</b> Sax‚Äôs rivals are not fully confirmed based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> measurements. It is also argued that the saxotromba family, so far considered extinct, is in fact represented by two members in the saxhorn family, the alto and the baritone. A number of related <b>instruments</b> emerged around <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century in various wraps and with different names. These are compared to saxhorns and classified according to bore-profile properties. Only certain groups were distinct, whereas most were essentially saxhorns in different forms.

40|$|<b>The</b> Landsat series <b>of</b> {{satellites}} is <b>the</b> longest set <b>of</b> continuously acquired moderate resolution multispectral {{satellite imagery}} collected {{on a single}} maintained <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>The</b> data are very attractive because the entire archive has been radiometrically calibrated and characterized so that sensor reaching radiance values are well known. However, these values are not easily understood or applied, so this dataset has not been utilized to its fullest potential. This work focuses on atmospheric compensation at each Landsat pixel which will later be used with ASTER derived emissivity data from JPL to perform LST retrievals. We develop a method to automatically generate the effective in band radiative transfer param- eters transmission, upwelled radiance, and downwelled radiance for each pixel. We validate our methodology by comparing our predicted apparent temperatures to ground truth water tempera- tures derived from buoy data {{at a number of}} validation sites around the continental United States. Initial validation was performed using Landsat 5. Results show a mean error of - 0. 267 K and a standard deviation of 0. 900 K for 259 cloud free scenes in the validation dataset. Based on the same validation dataset, our current best expectation for a confidence metric for the final product involves categorizing each pixel as cloudy, clouds in the vicinity, or cloud free based on <b>the</b> incorpo- ration <b>of</b> a Landsat cloud product. The mean and standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> errors associated with each category will be included as a quantitative basis for each category. To support future work, we explore the extension to a global dataset and possible improvements to the atmospheric compensation by more closely exploring the column water vapor contribution to error. Finally, we acknowledge the need for a more formal incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloud product, and possibly improvements, in order to finalize the confidence metric for the atmospheric compensation component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product...|$|R
