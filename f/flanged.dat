5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed <b>flanged</b> males. The transformation from unflanged to <b>flanged</b> can occur very quickly. Unflanged and <b>flanged</b> males have two different mating strategies. <b>Flanged</b> males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with <b>flanged</b> males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide <b>flanged</b> profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flanging</b> is {{a method}} of sheet metal forming process under {{combined}} compressive and tensile conditions using a punch and die to raise closed rims (flanges or collars) on pierced holes. For the <b>flanging</b> product used for the automotive steering part, {{the thickness of the}} bottom radius area is very important because of the crack usually occurred during the using process. But during conventional <b>flanging</b> process, the thickness of the rim and the bottom radius area were decreased seriously and make the hole <b>flanging</b> not strong enough to be used. In order to increase the thickness of bottom radius area of the <b>flanging</b> wall, a new method that combines <b>flanging</b> process and cold forging process was proposed in this paper and a special forming die set was designed with a stripper subjected to counter-pressure with an aim to obtain a more substantial flange. FEM software DEFORM 3 D was employed to simulate these <b>flanging</b> part forming processes. The results showed the thickness of bottom radius area of the <b>flanging</b> wall was increased and a more substantial flange was obtained...|$|R

Both EM and quasi-static <b>flanging</b> experiments were conducted with CuZn 30 specimens of 0. 127, 0. 508 and 1. 588 mm thicknesses that were heat treated to achieve 2 and 10 grains through the thickness to assess this parameter. Results from the quasi-static tests showed that as the sample size decreased with a constant grain size through thickness ratio, the springback angle increased. For the 0. 127 mm and 0. 508 mm thickness specimens, the EM {{results showed that the}} <b>flanging</b> angle increased as the power input increased from 1. 7 to 3. 7 kJ.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} surface defects of {{automobile}} outer panels, which alter significantly the vehicle quality. Such defects occur during springback, after forming or <b>flanging</b> steps, and {{are characterized by}} concave depression of small amplitude over the convex shape of the part. The aim of this work is to reproduce at the laboratory scale a surface defect that occurs after <b>flanging</b> on a geometry similar to a door upper corner. A dedicated device has been designed in order to generate small size surface defects during <b>flanging</b> of metallic thin sheets. The outer surface {{of the sample was}} digitalized and the spatial geometry of the defect was evaluated from curvature change along 2 D profiles. This study shows that the <b>flanging</b> height does not influence significantly the surface defect geometry whereas the <b>flanging</b> radius and the corner radius modify the defect depth. Finite element simulations were also performed to compare numerical depth of the defect with experiments and also to investigate the stress and strain states in the defect area. It was shown that the spatial location of the defect is well predicted but its depth was either over- or under-estimated. Moreover, strains remained very small in the defect area, and a compression state prevailed after <b>flanging,</b> whereas a stress gradient developed through the thickness after springback...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHole flanges are {{important}} functional elements in many {{sheet metal parts}}. They provide stiffness, allow for positioning and fixation, they guide cables etc. Hole <b>flanging</b> operations in sheet metal parts are typically performed using dedicated tooling. Recent publications proved that hole <b>flanging</b> by incremental sheet forming (i. e. incremental hole <b>flanging)</b> is an interesting alternative to the traditional operations with dedicated tools. In incremental hole <b>flanging,</b> limit hole expansion ratios of up to 4 were observed which are {{much larger than the}} typical expansion ratios of around 2. In addition, the high flexibility of the incremental sheet forming process is maintained, i. e. flanges can be formed using a universal CNC-driven forming tool without dedicated tooling. However, deficits in terms of process time and geometric accuracy still limit the industrial application. This paper investigates the process limits of incremental hole <b>flanging</b> and proposes two new approaches aiming to reduce current deficits. The first one is an adaptive blank holder that acts {{in the vicinity of the}} forming tool and reduces unwanted secondary deformation that would lead to deviations from the target geometry. The second one is a new process set-up that makes it possible to perform incremental hole <b>flanging</b> operations at high speed. Using these approaches, the flexibility of incremental forming and its advantages regarding high formability can be exploited, while the typical disadvantages such as geometric inaccuracies and long process times can be minimized...|$|R
