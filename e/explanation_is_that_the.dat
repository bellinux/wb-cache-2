5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the castle was guarded by five men. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged the town and the castle was overcome by artillery positioned on the higher ground of the overlooking hill behind it. An earthwork fort, called Gallants Bower, may subsequently have been built to protect this vulnerable position; an alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth. He first took the town, then Gallants Bower, before forcing the surrender of Sir Hugh Pollard, the castle's commander, the following day. The Carews' house was probably badly damaged during the attack.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{performing}} {{style of}} Shaoxing Literal Opera fit with women's nature. As young {{women tend to}} be more glorious on stage according to Sheng County's newspaper at <b>that</b> time, <b>the</b> tender and gentle features of Shaoxing Literal Art became more outstanding under such highlighting. Furthermore, Four Gong Qiang worked more vividly and delicately under women's performances.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first case of a double {{sensitization}} for two apparently not related allergens: disperse red textyle dye and topical ketoprofen. A possible <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> topical gel medication could act as a vehicle between the skin and the textile red dye, underlining {{the importance of a}} "carrier-substance" to facilitate the allergen penetration and a possible sensitization to it...|$|R
30|$|After 17 : 00 UT {{when the}} pump cycle changes to 2 min on, 2 min off, there {{also appears to}} be a gap of reduced or nonexistent {{backscatter}} close to the 32 nd range gate. Possible <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ionosphere <b>is</b> under-dense in this region of space or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CUTLASS radar orthogonality condition for backscatter breaks down here so no signal is received.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited {{by a small}} moonlet just inside it. The sharp {{outer edge of the}} δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
25|$|The last {{emergence}} {{observed in}} the series was on 29April (at 10:30:06). By this time, Io had completed thirty orbits around Jupiter since 7March: the apparent orbital period is 42hours 29minutes 3seconds. The difference seems tiny – 32seconds – but it meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emergence on 29April was occurring a quarter-hour after {{it would have been}} predicted. <b>The</b> only alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> observations on 7 and 14March were wrong by two minutes.|$|R
25|$|To enable {{censorship}} of undesirable sites, all Internet traffic {{into and out}} of Singapore was required to be routed through local proxy servers. As a token of this restriction, to placate social conservatives, prominent porn websites such as Playboy and Penthouse were blocked. <b>The</b> official <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government wanted to signal a stand on undesirable sites without unduly hindering the development of the Internet. However, websites of local origin were monitored more closely than those from overseas.|$|R
25|$|The Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) at the National University Hospital quietly {{closed in}} 2001. <b>The</b> {{official}} <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gynecologist in charge {{had left for}} private practice, and without him, the clinic {{did not have the}} skills to perform SRS. However, as early as 1987, the Ministry of Health had been directing hospitals to stop doing such operations on foreigners. It also discouraged them for Singaporeans, saying 'the increased danger of AIDS with such patients poses unnecessary risk to hospital staff'.|$|R
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
25|$|The pure {{anhydrous}} orthorhombic form (δ) rapidly {{changes to}} one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere, and a possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> OH− ions originating from the absorbed water facilitate the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass.|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} it is {{significant}} that the passages on James, John and the Testimonium are found in the Antiquities and not in the Jewish Wars, but provides three explanations for their absence from the Jewish Wars. One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Antiquities covers the time period involved at a greater length than the Jewish Wars. The second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of the Jewish Wars (c. 70 AD) and Antiquities (after 90 AD) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities. Another <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> passages were added to the Antiquities to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.|$|E
30|$|In {{the same}} figure, the empty growth channel {{resulting}} from the unexpected cut of the wire with the AFM probe can also be noticed. Broken pieces of silicon remaining in the channel reveal a slight electrical conduction (1011 Ω) although they are electrically isolated through the undoped a-Si:H layer (1012 Ω). Possible <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole surface of the remaining piece of silicon {{in contact with the}} a-Si:H layer fully contributes to decrease the electrical contact resistance or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> friction of the AFM tip induces charging effects which are electrically observable.|$|R
50|$|A {{less common}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Sneem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> knot in the scenic Ring of Kerry.|$|R
25|$|Scheele's {{study of}} the gas not yet named oxygen was {{prompted}} by a complaint by Torbern Olof Bergman, a professor at Upsala University who would eventually become Scheele's friend. Bergman informed Scheele <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saltpeter he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it {{came into contact with}} acetic acid. Scheele's quick <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> saltpeter had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and gave off a new phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid).|$|R
25|$|Accelerating {{expansion}}: The metric {{expansion of}} space {{seems to be}} speeding up. Dark energy has been proposed to explain this. A recent alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> geometry of space is not homogeneous (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all, however this conclusion is disputed.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{possibility is}} the undeciphered Rongorongo script of Easter Island. It is debated {{whether this is}} true writing and, if it is, whether it is another case of cultural diffusion of writing. The oldest example is from 1851, 139 years after their first contact with Europeans. One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> script was inspired by Spain's written annexation proclamation in 1770.|$|E
25|$|A popular <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{name comes}} from {{the name of the}} Telugu chieftain, Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu, Nayaka of Chandragiri and Vandavasi, father of Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, from whom the English {{acquired}} the town in 1639. The first official use of the name Chennai is said to be in a sale deed, dated 8 August 1639, to Francis Day of the East India Company.|$|E
25|$|Robinson's {{meeting with}} the man who became his manager, Marty Forkins, is said to have {{occurred}} when Robinson, working as a waiter, spilled soup on Forkins. After Robinson's death, Forkins and his wife, Rae Samuels, admitted <b>that</b> Samuels made <b>the</b> introduction after having seen Robinson perform with his partner, George Cooper. Their <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story <b>was</b> made up in order to obscure Robinson's & Cooper's partnership, and to more effectively promote Robinson as a solo act. The ruse was successful, making Robinson one of the first solo acts to break vaudeville's two-colored rule, which required African-American performers to work in pairs.|$|R
30|$|In 22 {{patients}} with ARDS, Grasso et al. found [14] <b>that</b> half <b>was</b> responder {{in terms of}} oxygenation after a single SI {{and the other half}} <b>was</b> not. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chest wall elastance was greater in the non responders than in responders, and hence, more pressure dissipated into the chest wall and less pressure was available to distend the lung in the non responder than in the responder group. Therefore, in setting the RM what counts is not the level of the airway pressure but the level of PL which takes into account the chest wall elastance magnitude.|$|R
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the name [...] "Wheeling" [...] are disputed. One of <b>the</b> more {{credible}} <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word comes from the Lenni-Lenape phrase wih link, which meant [...] "place of the head." [...] This supposedly referred to a white settler who was scalped and decapitated. His severed head was displayed at the confluence of Wheeling Creek and the Ohio River. The area had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. In the 17th century, the Iroquois from present-day New York state conquered the upper Ohio Valley, pushing out other tribes and maintaining the area as their hunting ground.|$|R
25|$|The basaltic {{rocks in}} the oceanic and {{continental}} sectors of the Cameroon line are similar in composition, although the more evolved rocks are quite distinct. The similarity in basaltic rocks may indicate {{they have the same}} source. Since the lithosphere mantle below Africa must be different in chemical and isotopic composition from the younger lithosphere below the Atlantic, one <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source is in the asthenosphere rather than in metasomatized lithosphere.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic problem}} with this <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Serrano {{decision}} and school finance equalization were actually quite popular among California voters. It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance equalization.|$|E
25|$|A {{more likely}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> keys were dropped {{by one of}} the limeburners shortly before being found, as the layer of dirt and shells they were found below was dated as around 2300–2800 years old, making La Trobe's dating implausible. According to {{geologist}} Edmund Gill, and engineer and historian Peter Alsop, the error by La Trobe is quite understandable, given that in 1847 most Europeans thought the world was only 6000 years old.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> afterimages from <b>the</b> retina (the McCullough effect) cause a moiré <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hard to identify.|$|R
30|$|Ideally, at the 180 ° direction, the LOS {{component}} of the signal should vanish completely due to the body shadowing. However, this CM 4 UWB WBAN channel realization model showed otherwise, and a residual LOS component still existed. One of possible <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body did not wholly attenuate the incoming LOS signal, allowing that residual LOS component to appear at {{the back side of}} the body (a human body is also a propagation medium or environment). Note that in both 90 ° and 180 ° directions, clusters of multipath components dominate the PDP. This is because the NLOS signals were dominant at those directions.|$|R
2500|$|In 1994, {{moderate}} and conservative Democrats within the U.S. House of Representatives organized {{themselves into the}} Blue Dog Democrats, {{in response to the}} Republican victories at <b>the</b> polls <b>that</b> November. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Blue Dogs felt the party had moved so far left that it had [...] "choked them blue." [...] The name is a reference to an earlier term, Yellow dog Democrat (typically, a southerner who would vote for a Democrat even if a [...] "yellow dog" [...] were the Democratic candidate) and also to the [...] "blue dog" [...] paintings of a Louisiana artist. The Blue Dog Coalition is not considered as conservative as the earlier Dixiecrat and Boll Weevil incarnations of conservative Democrats.|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{displacement}} is not definitively known, but one <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bowel becomes abnormally distended with gas (from excessive fermentation of grain, {{a change in}} the microbiota secondary to antibiotic use, or a buildup of gas secondary to impaction) which results in a shift in the bowel to an abnormal position. Because much of the bowel is not anchored to the body wall, it is free to move out of position. Displacement is usually diagnosed using a combination of findings from the rectal exam and ultrasonography.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} of conflict between Ertebølle settlements: an arrowhead in a pelvis at Skateholm, Sweden; a bone point in a throat at Vedbæk, Zealand; a bone point in the chest at Stora Biers, Sweden. More significant is evidence of cannibalism at Dyrholmen, Jutland, and Møllegabet on Ærø. There human bones were broken open to obtain the marrow. As cannibalism is not practiced to obtain food, the next most likely <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> warlike Ertebølle population ritually devoured its enemies in order to ingest their powers.|$|E
25|$|Densely intermingled moa bones {{have been}} {{encountered}} in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at Pyramid Valley in north Canterbury, where bones {{from at least}} 183 individual moa have been excavated, mostly by Roger Duff of Canterbury Museum. Many explanations have been proposed to account for how these deposits formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires. However the currently accepted <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bones accumulated at a slow rate over thousands of years, from birds that had entered the swamps to feed and became trapped in the soft sediment.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. <b>The</b> official <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|R

25|$|According to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Ramsey {{talking to}} his {{coaching}} staff {{about the possibility of}} dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given <b>the</b> impression <b>that</b> he had <b>been</b> distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. <b>The</b> only possible <b>explanations</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and <b>that</b> Hunter– who <b>was</b> of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps– was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.|$|R
