40|$|Abstract- The {{microwave}} signal depolarization {{caused by}} storms particles {{is one of}} the major problems in utilizing microwave bands for terrestrial and space communication especially at desert and semi desert area. This aim of this research is to study the effects of dust particles on the polarization state of microwave signal. The calculations, which were based on the probability density of Iraqi dust storms, were performed for six frequency bands of microwave signals.

These two parameters also depends on the shape of the dust particle, particles with low axial ratio can induce relatively high <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> and differential phase shift, and therefore cause more depolarization in the signal.
