25|$|Thioureas {{are used}} a {{building}} blocks to pyrimidine derivatives. Thus thioureas condense with β-dicarbonyl compounds. The amino {{group on the}} thiourea initially condenses with a carbonyl, followed by cyclization and tautomerization. <b>Desulfurization</b> delivers the pyrimidine.|$|E
25|$|In {{flue-gas}} <b>desulfurization,</b> {{exhaust gases}} from fossil-fuel power stations and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed {{to reduce their}} sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground limestone or lime. This produces an impure calcium sulfite, which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate.|$|E
25|$|USG Corporation, {{also known}} as United States Gypsum Corporation, is an American company which {{manufactures}} construction materials, most notably drywall and joint compound. The company is the largest distributor of wallboard in the United States and the largest manufacturer of gypsum products in North America. It is also a major consumer of synthetic gypsum, a byproduct of flue-gas <b>desulfurization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{upgrading}} is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, <b>desulfurization</b> {{must be done to}} get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.|$|E
25|$|Huge {{amounts of}} coal ash and other waste is {{produced}} annually. In 2013, the US alone consumed {{on the order}} of 983 million short tonnes of coal per year. Use of coal on this scale generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year. These include fly ash, bottom ash, and flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> sludge, that contain mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and other heavy metals, along with non-metals such as selenium.|$|E
25|$|Fossil-fuel power stations, {{particularly}} coal-fired plants, are a {{major source}} of industrial wastewater. Many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, as well as arsenic, selenium and nitrogen compounds (nitrates and nitrites). Wastewater streams include flue-gas <b>desulfurization,</b> fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. Plants with air pollution controls such as wet scrubbers typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream.|$|E
25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used {{treatment}} technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|E
25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E

2500|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the coal industry includes issues such as land use, waste management, water and air pollution, caused by the coal mining, processing {{and the use of}} its products. [...] In addition to atmospheric pollution, coal burning produces hundreds of millions of tons of solid waste products annually, including fly ash, bottom ash, and flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> sludge, that contain mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and other heavy metals.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{incentive}} for reducing emissions, for each ton of sulfur dioxide reduced below the applicable emissions limit, owners of a generating unit received an emissions allowance they could use at another unit, keep for future use, or sell. This legitimized a market for sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, administered by the Chicago Board of Trade. Units that installed flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> equipment (e.g., scrubbers) or other [...] "qualifying Phase I technology" [...] which reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 90%, qualified for a two-year extension of the 1995 deadline, provided they owned allowances to cover their total actual emissions for each year of the extension period.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur dioxide {{is a major}} air {{pollutant}} and has significant impacts upon human health. [...] In addition, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat suitability for plant communities, as well as animal life. Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to acid rain and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the US EPA’s Acid Rain Program, the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002. [...] This improvement resulted in part from flue-gas <b>desulfurization,</b> a technology that enables SO2 to be chemically bound in power plants burning sulfur-containing coal or oil. In particular, calcium oxide (lime) reacts with sulfur dioxide to form calcium sulfite: ...|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{energy is}} {{required}} for [...] capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has {{to be used to}} produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants the range is 11–22% and for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14–25% [...] Obviously, fuel use and environmental problems arising from mining and extraction of coal or gas increase accordingly. Plants equipped with flue-gas <b>desulfurization</b> (FGD) systems for sulfur dioxide control require proportionally greater amounts of limestone, and systems equipped with selective catalytic reduction systems for nitrogen oxides produced during combustion require proportionally greater amounts of ammonia.|$|E

50|$|Thermoplasma volcanium {{exhibits}} extremophile characteristics {{through its}} lack of a cell wall to sustain proper functioning at high temperatures and high acidity levels. Thermoplasma volcanium’s anaerobic metabolism is capable of utilizing sulfur respiration, {{which can be used}} commercially by coal mining or petroleum industries to desulfurize coal stores. The burning of coal {{is one of the largest}} man-made contributions to sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, which can form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid. Bacteria with proven <b>desulfurization</b> abilities (such as Thermoplasma volcanium) could be isolated and used in an attempt to identify, isolate, and clone the genes or enzymes responsible for <b>desulfurization.</b> To be able to harness the <b>desulfurization</b> process for economical and ecological use, an increase in the activity of the <b>desulfurization</b> pathway would be necessary. This activity enhancement could possibly occur by increasing the number present of the genes and/or increasing the amount of gene expression. It could also be possible to change the gene product yield of the <b>desulfurization</b> pathway to produce a better product for commercial use. If Thermoplasma volcanium’s extremophilic characteristics for <b>desulfurization</b> can be harnessed, then industries will be able to limit the amount of sulfur-induced environmental damage via acid rain, helping to better preserve the environment. Through this method, it may also offer insight into reversing the effects of sulfur within global warming.|$|E
