40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the service life as precisely and reliably as possible we need good mathematical models for describing loading, geometry, properties of materials and fracture mechanics parameters. It can be established whether a mathematical model is precise and reliable only by comparison of results of the method such as analytical methods in case of simple problems and experiment when real complex structure are deal with. Since <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> <b>gearing</b> belong to the second group, by correctly selected and developed test pieces and carefully planned experiments we obtained results with which we confirmed and justified the mathematical model for calculating mentioned parameters. To this end we will show in this paper series of experimental methods and test pieces used on the gears...|$|E
40|$|Abstract For {{designing}} {{machines and}} devices the dimensioning {{with respect to}} service life is increasingly taken into account. This applies also for gearing which are still today one of very important components of almost all machines. The problem of determination of the service life of gearing {{is directly related to}} geometry of gears, multiaxial loadings, materials and appropriate models for prediction of the crack propagation. Obviously <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> <b>gearing</b> belong to the real complex structure, by correctly selected and carefully planned experiments we obtained results with which we can confirm and justified the mathematical model for calculating different parameters, i. e. service life. In paper {{the past and the future}} of gears/gearings calculation will be point out, from deterministic calculations to mathematical modelling and from “classical ” experimental techniques and procedure to more sophisticated one...|$|E

Many {{contemporary}} bicycles have multiple <b>gears</b> <b>and</b> thus multiple <b>gear</b> ratios. A shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, <b>and</b> a low <b>gear</b> when cycling uphill.

40|$|Abstract—Research {{in damage}} of <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> <b>gear</b> pairs using {{vibration}} signals {{is still very}} attractive, because vibration signals from a gear pairs are complex in nature and not easy to interpret. Predicting gear pairs defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of gears pairs in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information usually covered under noise of other gear pairs dynamic factors. This paper {{presents the results of}} an evaluation of vibration analysis techniques as a method for the <b>gear</b> <b>and</b> <b>gear</b> pairs condition assessment. The origin of vibration in <b>gear</b> pairs <b>and</b> useful definition of damage identification techniques are presented. The detection and assessment capability {{of some of the most}} effective vibration techniques are discussed and experimentally compared, concerning a multistage industrial gearbox. In particular, the results of estimated vibration signal processing techniques are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of estimated techniques having in mind specific limitation have been shown. Further research in damage identification of gear pairs have been pointed out. Index Term — spiral bevel gear, gear pairs, gear damage, vibration signal processing I...|$|R
