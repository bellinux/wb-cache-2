25|$|The overall {{research}} goal {{of artificial}} intelligence {{is to create}} technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an <b>intelligent</b> <b>system</b> to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.|$|E
25|$|Agent {{architectures}} {{and cognitive}} architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system. A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid <b>intelligent</b> <b>system,</b> {{and the study}} of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration. A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling. Rodney Brooks' subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.|$|E

25|$|An IoT-enabled <b>intelligent</b> <b>system</b> of {{such cases}} was {{proposed}} in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on {{a band saw}} machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. Band saw machines are not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users when {{is the best time to}} replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.|$|E
500|$|The AI {{functions}} {{were divided}} into three different categories: [...] "meta", which governed the environment and in-game progression; [...] "character", which was devoted to the guest and non-playable characters (NPCs); and [...] "navigation", which determined the best route and pattern for characters and other moving elements such as enemies to travel. The tasks assigned to the meta-AI were so numerous and large that {{it needed to be}} divided into separate interconnected elements, which included implementing a hierarchical structure for task management, transitioning and the merger of functions to create an <b>intelligent</b> <b>system,</b> and the exchange of various elements with specific localities. For the character-AI, a major point was the coordination between the AI and character animations when responding to different situations. Different levels and styles of AI were created for different groups of non-playable characters within XVs world, from the main party members to NPCs around the world. To ensure the navigation-AI worked properly for enemies and monsters, a system dubbed the [...] "Point Query System" [...] (PQS) was created, which could direct and steer them in a realistic manner while avoiding collisions with objects in the environment or other moving elements. A PQS was created for each enemy type, and made small changes to their behaviors easier to implement. The decision to create high-quality reactive AI for Noctis' companions helped influence the choice of making Noctis the only playable character.|$|E

The layers form a hybrid <b>intelligent</b> <b>system</b> in which the lowest, reactive layers are sub-symbolic. The higher layers, having relaxed time constraints, are capable of reasoning from an abstract world model and performing planning.

40|$|Abstract. Integrating sound {{assessment}} and instruction {{has been a}} long-sought goal in education. Recent advances in educational measurement, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence have placed this goal within our reach. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>systems</b> may be improved by leveraging assessment information that is gathered from various sources (e. g., summative and formative), thus providing a viable approach toward accomplishing the aforementioned goal. This chapter analyzes the role of assessment in <b>intelligent</b> <b>systems,</b> summarizes the characteristics of successfully deployed <b>intelligent</b> <b>systems,</b> and describes an evidence-based approach to incorporating valid and reliable assessments into enhanced <b>intelligent</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

6000|$|These things--if {{we could}} bring them about--would leave us {{with a sort of}} {{clarified}} Problem of the Unemployed on our hands. Our Minimum Wage would have strained these people out, and, provided there existed what is already growing up, an <b>intelligent</b> <b>system</b> of employment bureaus, we should have much more reason to conclude than we have at present, that they were mainly unemployed because of a real incapacity in character, strength, or intelligence for efficient citizenship. Our raised standards of housing, our persecution of overcrowding, and our obstruction of employment below the minimum wage, would have swept out the rookeries and hiding-places of these people of the Abyss. They would exist, but they would not multiply--and that is our supreme end. They would be tramping on roads where mendicity laws would prevail, there would be no house-room for them, no squatting-places. The casual wards would catch them and register them, and telephone one to the other about them. It is rare that children come into this world without a parent or so being traceable. Everything would converge to convince these people that to bear children into such an unfavourable atmosphere is an extremely inconvenient and undesirable thing. They would not have many children, and such children as they had would fall easily into our organized net and get the protection of the criticised and improved development of the existing charitable institutions. [Footnote: [...] "I wonder whether there is any legal flaw in the second section of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act of 1894, which may have been specially aimed at beggars with offspring. It is specially punishable to beg having an infant in their arms, quite apart from teaching the infant in question to beg. Or is this law insufficiently enforced through popular apathy?"--C. G. STUART MENTEATH.] This is {{the best we can do}} for those poor little creatures. As for that increasing section of the Abyss that will contrive to live childless, these papers have no quarrel with them. A childless wastrel is a terminating evil, and it may be, a picturesque evil. I must confess that a lazy rogue is very much to my taste, provided there is no tragedy of children to smear the joke with misery. And if he or she neither taints nor tempts the children, who are our care, a childless weakling we may freely let our pity and mercy go out to. To go childless is in them a virtue for which they merit our thanks.|$|E

40|$|Many complex {{problems}} including financial investment planning, foreign exchange trading, knowledge discovery from large/multiple databases require hybrid <b>intelligent</b> <b>systems</b> that integrate many intelligent techniques including expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms.
