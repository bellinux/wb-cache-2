25|$|The {{argument}} that this policy affords the public {{a sense of}} revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians <b>indeed</b> <b>is,</b> they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.|$|E
25|$|Boron is {{classified}} as a metalloid while the rest, {{with the possible exception}} of nihonium, are considered post-transition metals. Boron occurs sparsely, probably because bombardment by the subatomic particles produced from natural radioactivity disrupts its nuclei. Aluminium occurs widely on earth, and <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (8.3%). Gallium is found in the earth with an abundance of 13 ppm. Indium is the 61st most abundant element in the earth's crust, and thallium is found in moderate amounts throughout the planet. Nihonium is never found in nature and therefore is termed a synthetic element.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, tea is {{consumed}} daily and often {{by a majority}} of people, and <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> perceived as one of Britain's cultural beverages. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea {{is consumed}} both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of scones, clotted cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some parts of Britain, 'tea' may also refer to the evening meal.|$|E

25|$|They {{also argued}} that there <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> a {{difference}} between a) and b): Case a) is the ordinary case of length contraction, based {{on the concept of}} the rod's rest length l0 in S0, which always stays the same as long as the rod can be seen as rigid. Under those circumstances, the rod is contracted in S. But the distance cannot be seen as rigid in case b) because it is increasing due to unequal accelerations in S0, and the rockets would have to exchange information with each other and adjust their velocities in order to compensate for this – all of those complications don't arise in case a).|$|E
25|$|Total depravity is {{the fallen}} state of {{man as a}} result of {{original}} sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and philanthropy are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in Reformed theology, if God is to save anyone He must predestine, call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> incapable of choosing God.|$|E
25|$|There are {{generally}} two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation of cognition. Writings on metacognition {{can be traced}} back {{at least as far as}} De Anima and the Parva Naturalia of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to sapient species and <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> one of the definitions of sapience. There is evidence that rhesus monkeys and apes can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty, while attempts to demonstrate metacognition in birds have been inconclusive. A 2007 study provided some evidence for metacognition in rats, but further analysis suggested that they may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, or a behavioral economic model.|$|E

25|$|The modern Hebrew {{calendar}} {{follows a}} seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently but {{independently of the}} monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the Sabbath, {{as well as the}} true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus. 20 v. 10; and 24 v. 21; Deut. 5. v. 14; Amos 8 v. 5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon , as <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1 v. 13; Amos 8 v. 5; H Kings 6 v. 23).|$|E
25|$|Duchal Castle, on the {{outskirts}} of Kilmacolm, was constructed by Ralph de l'Isle (later Anglicised to Lyle) in the 13th century and remained in the family until purchased by the Porterfields in 1544. The Porterfields occupied the castle until 1710 when much of it was deconstructed and the stone used to build a new home further down the River Gryffe, which exists to this day as Duchal House. The ruins of the castle are still located in the parish. The name 'duchal' means 'between two rivers' and this <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the Castle's position, set between Green Water and its tributary, the Blacketty Water. Most significant in the Castle's history was its siege by King James IV of Scotland in July 1489, following the Lyle's support of an insurrection against him. The King attended personally and, according to accounts, the inhabitants of the Castle surrendered immediately on the sight of the famous Mons Meg cannon being rolled into position against them. The castle, however, was fired upon, and one of the Royal cannon gained the name Duchal.|$|E

That <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> service to God".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, German scholar Ernst Förstemann {{interpreted}} {{the last page}} of the Dresden Codex as {{a representation of the}} end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event. His ideas were repeated by archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, [...] "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World... Here, <b>indeed,</b> <b>is</b> portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" [...] in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, The Ancient Maya, the first edition of which was published in 1946.|$|E
500|$|It was {{shortly after}} he arrived in New York in 1939 that Reich first said he had {{discovered}} a biological or cosmic energy, an extension of Freud's idea of the libido. He called it [...] "orgone energy" [...] or [...] "orgone radiation," [...] {{and the study of}} it [...] "orgonomy." [...] Reich said he had seen orgone when he injected his mice with bions and in the sky at night through an [...] "organoscope," [...] a special telescope. He argued that it is in the soil and air (<b>indeed,</b> <b>is</b> omnipresent), is blue or blue-grey, and that humanity had divided its knowledge of it in two: aether for the physical aspect and God for the spiritual. The colour of the sky, the northern lights, St Elmo's Fire, and the blue of sexually excited frogs are manifestations of orgone, he wrote. He also argued that protozoa, red corpuscles, cancer cells and the chlorophyll of plants are charged with it.|$|E

500|$|Mauna Loa is {{slumping}} eastward {{along its}} southwestern rift zone, leveraging its mass into Kīlauea and driving the latter eastward {{at a rate}} of about [...] per year; the interaction between the two volcanoes in this manner has generated a number of large earthquakes in the past, and has resulted in a significant area of debris off of Kīlauea's seaward flank known as the Hilina Slump. A system of older faults exists on the southeastern side of Mauna Loa that likely formed before Kilauea became large enough to impede Mauna Loa's slump, the lowest and northernmost of which, the Kaoiki fault, remains an active earthquake center today. The west side of Mauna Loa, meanwhile, is unimpeded in movement, and <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> believed to have undergone a massive slump collapse between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, the residue from which, consisting of a scattering of debris up to several kilometers wide and up to [...] distant, is still visible today. The damage was so extensive that the headwall of the damage likely intersected its southwestern rift zone. There is very little movement there today, a consequence of the volcano's geometry.|$|E
500|$|Morris' biographer E.P. Thompson {{described}} him as having a [...] "robust bearing, and a slight roll in his walk", alongside a [...] "rough beard" [...] and [...] "disordered hair". The author Henry James described Morris as [...] "short, burly, corpulent, very careless and unfinished in his dress... He has a loud voice and a nervous restless manner and a perfectly unaffected and businesslike address. His talk <b>indeed</b> <b>is</b> wonderfully to the point and remarkable for clear good sense." [...] Morris' first biographer Mackail {{described him}} as being both [...] "a typical Englishman" [...] and [...] "a typical Londoner of the middle class" [...] albeit one who was transformed into [...] "something quite individual" [...] through the [...] "force of his genius". MacCarthy described Morris' lifestyle as being [...] "late Victorian, mildly bohemian, but bourgeois", with Mackail commenting that he exhibited many of the traits of the bourgeois Victorian class: [...] "industrious, honest, fair-minded up their lights, but unexpansive and unsympathetic". Although he generally disliked children, Morris also exhibited {{a strong sense of}} responsibility toward his family. Mackail nevertheless thought he [...] "was interested in things much more than in people" [...] and that while he did have [...] "lasting friendships" [...] and [...] "deep affections", he did not allow people to [...] "penetrate to the central part of him." ...|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything seems to be on the decline, as, <b>indeed,</b> <b>is</b> the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E
