5|$|On December 23, 2011, Lovato {{posted a}} message on Twitter criticizing her former network for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which {{characters}} <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> eating disorders. Disney Channel publicity officials quickly took action, apologizing to Lovato and removing the episodes from the network's broadcast and video on demand sources after additional criticism (following Lovato's post) on the network's public-relations account.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{continued}} to treat potential romantic partners with caution. In 1828, she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper Mérimée, but her one surviving letter to him {{appears to be}} a deflection of his declaration of love. She was delighted when her old friend from Italy, Edward Trelawny, returned to England, and they <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> marriage in their letters. Their friendship had altered, however, following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley; and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelley's poems. Oblique references in her journals, from the early 1830s until the early 1840s, suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk, who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day Roker stated, [...] "I started <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> logo. I {{want to make}} this clear—I was not <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> epilepsy or anyone who suffers from epilepsy. We understand and know that this is a serious affliction and would never <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> that. We were <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> the logo—not about epilepsy. If anybody was offended, I heartily and really humbly apologize." ...|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{some things}} on the show evolved into running gags. For example, Rudi Carrell always made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Mike Krüger's nose, who in turn made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the Dutch and their caravans and about Carrell's age. Kalle Pohl {{was the victim of}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> dwarfism, Bernd Stelter about fat people, Oliver Welke about baldness, Jochen Busse about ironing creases and Gaby Köster had to suffer <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> women.|$|R
50|$|Comedy {{television}} show Saturday Night Live satirized ESPN's {{use of the}} phrase, pointing out the difference in society's reaction to racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Asian people versus racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> black people. In the skit, three sports commentators were featured happily making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Lin's race, while a fourth drew contempt for making similar comments about black players.|$|R
5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan {{in a final}} frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E

50|$|Some roastees {{have stated}} that certain topics are off-limits. Pamela Anderson, for example, {{prohibited}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her Hepatitis C infection. Joan Rivers disallowed <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her daughter, Melissa and William Shatner asked that {{the death of his}} wife not be mentioned. Others, like David Hasselhoff, have imposed no limits on the topics. Donald Trump only prohibited anyone making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> him not being as wealthy as he says he is. Although Charlie Sheen initially agreed to no restrictions on his roast, he later said during an interview with Jay Leno that he requested <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his mother be edited out of the broadcast.|$|R

2500|$|A Sickipedia <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> {{stricken}} Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba on {{the evening}} of his cardiac arrest on the pitch at White Hart Lane caused outrage on Twitter. In February 2009, the site was criticized as [...] "monstrous" [...] for its <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the death of Francesca Anobile, and one of the site's users reported [...] "very real threats of legal action". In October 2012, a 19-year-old from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for copying and pasting Sickipedia <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> abducted children April Jones and Madeleine McCann onto Facebook.|$|R

25|$|Dog {{consumption}} in Indonesia gained attention during the 2012 U.S. Presidential election when incumbent Barack Obama {{was pointed out}} by his opponent to have eaten dog meat served by his Indonesian stepfather Lolo Soetoro when Obama {{was living in the}} country. Obama wrote about his experience of eating dog in his book Dreams of My Father, and at the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> eating dog.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, {{during an}} 18-night stint at London's Hammersmith Apollo, Connolly was criticised for making {{jokes about the}} hostage Kenneth Bigley. Shortly after Connolly <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> the future killing of the hostage and touched {{on the subject of}} Bigley's young Thai wife, Bigley was {{beheaded}} in Iraq. Connolly claims he was misquoted. He has declined to clarify what he actually said, claiming that the context was as important as the precise words used.|$|E
25|$|Malacañang had defended Duterte's remarks, {{claiming}} {{that it should}} not be taken seriously because it is due to heightened bravado. Several public officials expressed their distaste for the remark, including a Bangsamoro committee member who quit the council out of sheer disgust. Women's rights groups protested Duterte's statements {{claiming that}} rape is a heinous crime and should not be <b>joked</b> <b>about,</b> even alleging that the Maranao refugees in the evacuation camps were being threatened with rape by soldiers who were encouraged by the President.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> {{her own life}} and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke." [...] She received multiple death threats throughout her career.|$|R

25|$|The {{stranger}} {{was never}} solidly identified. He was variously identified {{by parents and}} friends as a host of men, including Al Watson, John Barrett, Earl Keesee and Joseph Ahrens; the coroner <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> {{the inability of the}} man to stay identified. Investigators considered the most credible possibilities as Barrett, a former Canadian Soldier who disappeared from Chicago's skid row that same day, or Eddie Ryan, whose mother was a homeless washerwoman named Nellie Ryan who had given him years earlier to a farmer to raise and then identified his body.|$|E
25|$|Mention in {{the media}} is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not {{uncommon}} in some media, especially adult cartoon series such as Family Guy and South Park, satirical comedy such as Borat, and films (especially shock exploitation films), although a few broadcasters such as Howard Stern (who <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and Tom Binns (whose XFM London Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.|$|E
25|$|John Boyd as James Aubrey (seasons 10–12), {{a junior}} FBI agent working under Booth. Originally, Aubrey tries to win Booth's {{approval}} and trust, as Booth is reluctant due to Aubrey's inexperience, however he is eventually accepted by Booth {{and the rest}} of the team. Aubrey gets along with everyone and his love of food is often <b>joked</b> <b>about.</b> When he was a child, his father was an investment broker who cheated his clients and fled the country, abandoning Aubrey and his mother and leaving them with nothing. In season 11, it is found out that Aubrey's father is back in the country.|$|E
5000|$|Caution had to {{be taken}} with <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> drink, with not too many allowed to be made in any single programme. Also to be avoided were {{derogatory}} references to solicitors, miners and [...] "the working class". Banned too was any reference to The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, or <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his name, in response to previous complaints.|$|R
40|$|<b>Jokes</b> <b>about</b> stupidity are {{extremely}} common in most countries, as ethnic, national, regional and locality jokes, political <b>jokes,</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> occupations and social classes, and blonde and Essex-girl jokes. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a theory that will explain why such diverse groups of people should be the butts of what is essentially the same joke. It will also explain jokes that are the opposite of the stupidity jokes, the widespread <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the canny (clever, crafty, calculating, stingy), whether <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> ethnic groups, regional groups, townspeople or occupations. The key explanatory variables are first, the dominance of centre over periphery whether defined in geographical, cultural, language or social class terms and second, among the powerful, the contrast between those who hold arbitrary monopoly power based on control of the state and the means of force and those who have achieved their position through legitimate competition...|$|R

25|$|Bastion Properties was {{in trouble}} because of {{building}} costs and an unsatisfactory building manager. After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly hit by the Selwyn Lloyd financial squeeze of 1961 and, still not yet thirty years old, he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E
25|$|On March 28, Almeida {{appeared}} in court defended by Brigadier General William Henry Winder and Walter Dorsey, a court judge in Baltimore County. The defense argument was simple: the Congreso {{was not an}} American ship but of the United Provinces. Its owner (Aguirre) was {{a citizen of the}} United Provinces, as was Almeida, which was actually false, and that Baltimore was not a corsair base but rather only a safe harbor. While Judge James Houston in private not believe in the veracity of the arguments, and even <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> the changing the crew list to Anglo-Saxon names, dismissed the cause for insufficient evidence and ordered that his ship be returned to him.|$|E
25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, {{who loved to}} drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths of}} pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did not want them “talked and <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Leno was {{initially}} {{not allowed to}} tell <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Shows opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others. The gag order was challenged, and {{the court ruled that}} Leno could continue telling <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.|$|R
5000|$|Patients {{and staff}} have made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the NHS to one another, {{on a daily}} basis, {{throughout}} time. However, {{it is very hard}} to locate and to understand these. [...] Sometimes 'everyday' <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the NHS are mentioned in passing in newspaper coverage. For example, one letter published by the Daily Mail in October 1988 described the experiences of an NHS secretary who 'seethed with anger' when hearing a consultant <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> spending his days on a golf course. [...] The People's History of the NHS project at the University of Warwick has collected more such memories on its website, and invites contributions for more.|$|R
