40|$|As {{wireless}} networks evolves {{towards the}} 3 G and 4 G architectures the mobile core networks provides {{a platform for}} all-IP convergence of mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>networks</b> allowing for better integration of the Internet and cellular networks, providing better quality of service, charging mechanisms and integration of different services. Due to this convergence, there have been various evidences of interoperability limitations between the mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>networks</b> such as protocol adaptation, end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS), charging and signalling interworking. Most of these limitations are currently been addressed by respective standards bodies and various proposals are being implemented. In this paper we investigate the signalling limitations across converged networks which are caused {{by the use of}} different Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) profiles for signalling in both mobile and <b>fixed</b> <b>networks.</b> We carried out various performance based simulations on the 3 GPP proposed solution in which our results reveal critical shortcomings in the solution. We then proposed a new configuration for the system to enable the solution work more efficiently...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the GSM protocol, the DECT network {{specifications}} do {{not define}} cross-linkages between {{the operation of}} the entities (for example, Mobility Management and Call Control). The architecture presumes that such linkages will be designed into the interworking unit that connects the DECT access network to whatever mobility-enabled <b>fixed</b> <b>network</b> is involved. By keeping the entities separate, the handset is capable of responding to any combination of entity traffic, and this creates great flexibility in <b>fixed</b> <b>network</b> design without breaking full interoperability.|$|E
