2500|$|Kirwan's last album, <b>Hello</b> <b>There</b> Big Boy!, {{featured}} guitar {{contributions by}} his Fleetwood Mac replacement, Bob Weston. Kirwan {{was not well}} at this time {{and it is not}} clear how much, if any, guitar work he contributed to the recording, though he did sing on all the tracks. Far fewer of the songs were self-penned, and there was one song ("Only You") dug up from his Fleetwood Mac days. There were also backing vocalists for the first time, and the musical style was much less distinct. Producer Clifford Davis added the contribution of 87 musicians to the final recording, and later described the album as [...] "so bad".|$|E

[...] On 4 December, at about 5:30 am London time (GMT) or 4:30 pm Sydney time (AEST), the hosts of the Hot30 Countdown radio programme, Mel Greig and Mike Christian, called the hospital and spoke to Saldanha. Impersonating Elizabeth II, Greig said: [...] "Oh <b>hello</b> <b>there,</b> could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter." [...] Saldanha responded, [...] "Oh yes. Hold on," [...] and transferred the call to the Duchess's nurse, who spent approximately two minutes speaking with Greig as well as Christian, the latter impersonating Prince Charles. The hosts used what were later described as [...] "ridiculous comedy accents." ...|$|E

[...] {{said the}} Colonel {{to himself as}} he halted at the private gateway which opened on to the cliff and {{surveyed}} it affronting sea and sky in all its naked horror.

[...] "You'll find that everybody who doesn't go south or sleep all winter has a thicker coat than usual. <b>Hello!</b> <b>There</b> is old Roughleg the Hawk! He has come extra early this year. I think I'll go back to warn Nanny." [...] Without another word Danny disappeared in the brown grass. Again Blacky chuckled. [...] "More signs," [...] said he to himself. [...] "More signs. There isn't a doubt that {{we are going}} to have a hard winter. I wonder if I can stand it or if I'd better go a little way south, where it will be warmer." ...|$|E

Jim and Wallace an' me went tumblin' {{down after}} the dogs, each one lookin' {{out for his}} perticilar dog, an' darn me if I don't believe his lion, too. Don took one oozin' down the canyon, with me hot-footin' it after him. An' somewhere he treed thet lion, right below me, in a box canyon, sort of an {{offshoot}} of the second rim, an' I couldn't locate him. I blamed near killed myself more'n once. Look at my knuckles! Barked em slidin' about a mile down a smooth wall. I thought once the lion had jumped Don, but soon I heard him barkin' again. All thet time I heard Sounder, an' once I heard the pup. Jim yelled, an' somebody was shootin'. But I couldn't find nobody, or make nobody hear me. Thet canyon is a mighty deceivin' place. You'd never think so till you go down. I wouldn't climb up it again for all the lions in Buckskin. <b>Hello,</b> <b>there</b> comes Jim oozin' up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, Boston's full of 'em," [...] he said excitedly. [...] "One of 'em {{come up to}} me just now, {{and says}} he, 'Seems to me I've seen you before, but I can't place you.' 'Oh yes,' says I, 'I'll tell you where it was. I {{happened}} to be in the police court one morning when they was sendin' you up for three months.' I tell you he got round the corner! Might 'a' played checkers on his coat tail. Why, what do you suppose would been the next thing if I hadn't have let him know I saw through him?" [...] demanded the young man of Barker, who listened to this adventure with imperfect intelligence. [...] "He'd 'a' said, 'Hain't I seen you down Kennebunk way som'eres?' And when I said, 'No, I'm from Leominster!' or where-ever I was from if I was green, he'd say, 'Oh yes, so it was Leominster. How's the folks?' and he'd try to get me to think that he was from Leominster too; and then he'd want me to go off and see the sights with him; and pretty soon he'd meet a feller that 'ud dun him for that money he owed him; and he'd say he hadn't got anything with him but a cheque for forty dollars; and the other feller'd say he'd got to have his money, and he'd kind of insinuate it was all a put-up job about the cheque for forty dollars, anyway; and that 'ud make the first feller mad, and he'd take out the check, and ask him what he thought o' that; and the other feller'd say, well, it was a good cheque, but it wan't money, and he wanted money; and then the first feller'd say, 'Well, come along to the bank and get your money,' and the other'd say the bank was shut. 'Well, then,' the first feller'd say, 'well, sir, I ain't a-goin' to ask any favour of you. How much is your bill?' and the other feller'd say ten dollars, or fifteen, or may be twenty-five, if they thought I had that much, and the first feller'd say, 'Well, here's a gentleman from up my way, and I guess he'll advance me that much on my cheque if I make it worth his while. He knows me.' And the first thing you know--he's been treatin' you, and so polite, showin' you round, and ast you to go to the theayter--you advance the money, and you keep on with the first feller, and pretty soon he asks you to hold up a minute, he wants to go back and get a cigar; and he goes round the corner, and you hold up, and hold up, and in about a half an hour, or may be less time, you begin to smell a rat, and you go for a policeman, and the next morning you find your name in the papers, 'One more unfortunate!' You look out for 'em, young feller! Wish I had let that one go on till he done something so I could handed him over to the cops. It's a shame they're allowed to go 'round, when the cops knows 'em. <b>Hello!</b> <b>There</b> comes my mate, now." [...] The young man spoke as if they had been talking of his mate and expecting him, and another young man, his counterpart in dress, but of a sullen and heavy demeanour very unlike his own brisk excitement, approached, flapping a bank-note in his hand. [...] "I just been tellin' this young feller about that beat, you know." ...|$|E
