5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of <b>handwriting,</b> leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any <b>handwriting</b> or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E

50|$|Historically A-diaeresis {{was written}} as an A with two dots above the letter. A-umlaut was written as an A {{with a small}} e written above: this minute e {{degenerated}} to two vertical bars in medieval <b>handwritings</b> (A̎ a̎). In most later <b>handwritings</b> these bars in turn nearly became dots.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{character}} segmentation, <b>handwritings</b> {{are especially}} tough for detection. The characters in <b>handwritings</b> are often written {{too close to}} each other, {{making it difficult to}} segment the characters or to separate the letters apart. Hence, copying texts from these types of sources will result in high inaccuracy and with jumbled letters.|$|R
5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} <b>handwriting</b> (see the section on <b>handwriting</b> below), they all agree that the <b>handwriting</b> of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work {{in that part of the}} manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles {{was aware that}} the <b>handwriting</b> is typical for the 6th century, but the <b>handwriting</b> of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, and {{could not have been}} written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, {{the manuscript}} could not have been written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century.|$|E

50|$|Historically {{the unique}} letter Ü and U-diaeresis were written as a U with two dots above the letter.

5|$|Duckles {{hypothesized}} that the first hand might have been that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and {{is believed to have}} been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the <b>handwriting</b> does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's <b>handwriting</b> recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the <b>handwriting.</b> This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|Abbreviations {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} codex. The <b>handwriting</b> {{is very close to}} that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses {{grammatical}} forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which are not used in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|Historically O-diaeresis {{was written}} as an O with two dots above the letter. O-umlaut was written as an O {{with a small}} e written above in cursive old German (Gothic) script: this minute e is {{represented}} by two vertical bars connected by a slanted line, which then degenerated to two vertical bars in early modern <b>handwritings.</b> In most later <b>handwritings</b> these bars in turn nearly became dots. The origin of the letter Ö was a similar ligature for the digraph OE: e was written above o and degenerated into two small dots.|$|R
30|$|There {{are only}} a few studies in the {{literature}} that investigate the automatic detection of gender, age, and handedness from <b>handwritings.</b> Bandi et al. [1] proposed a system that classifies the <b>handwritings</b> into demographic categories using the ‘macro-features’ introduced in [2]. These features focus on measures such as pen pressure, writing movement, stroke formation, and word proportion. The authors reported classification accuracies of 77.5 %, 86.6 %, and 74.4 % for gender, age, and handedness classification, respectively. However, in this study, all the writers had to produce the same letter.|$|R
5|$|Bembo's italic is {{not based}} {{directly}} {{on the work of}} Griffo, but on the work of calligrapher and <b>handwriting</b> teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio). He published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing, in Venice in 1524, after the time of Manutius and Griffo, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. (Tagliente did not only publish on <b>handwriting,</b> but also self-help guides on learning to read, arithmetic, embroidery and a book of model love letters.) It too was imitated in France, with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards. Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, also a calligrapher who became involved in printing. His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth-century font designs.|$|E

Analysis of the killer's <b>handwriting</b> links him to almost forty open house viewings over the previous six months.|$|E
5|$|By the Roman Period of Egypt, the {{traditional}} Egyptian reed pen {{had been replaced}} by the chief writing tool of the Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian <b>handwriting,</b> as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} {{based on}} Fusing Multi-Biometrics {{is a hot}} point in authentications. A new method fusing multi-biometric features base on PCA is proposed in this paper. At first, the features are extracted from the voice, face images and online <b>handwritings</b> of one person. Then, three features are fused by the means of PCA method. Finally, the authorization is implemented through classification by minimizing the Euclidean distance of different people. The dataset we built includes the voice, face image and online <b>handwritings</b> of 20 volunteers. Our method performs much better on this dataset when the EER (Equal Error Rate) is 1 %.  ...|$|R

5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, {{because it has}} a small number of square letters, and the <b>handwriting</b> is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ is short and the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E

His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling <b>handwriting</b> with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E
