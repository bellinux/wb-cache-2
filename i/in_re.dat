5|$|No {{organisation}} run {{for profit}} {{can be a}} charity; a fee-paying school may be a charitable body despite the fees paid, but not if they are directly run to make a profit, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Girls' Public Day School Trust.

5|$|A {{secret trust}} must be contrasted with merely placing a moral {{obligation}} upon the beneficiary {{to deal with the}} legacy in particular way (as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Snowden) and must impose a binding obligation, without discretion to act within its terms or not.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Harwood.|$|E

5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004, the ACLU, {{along with}} Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, sued {{the state of}} California on behalf of six {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses.

5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. <b>In</b> <b>Re</b> Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. <b>In</b> <b>Re</b> Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. <b>In</b> <b>Re</b> Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

40|$|Strongly anticipatory systems-that is, systems {{which use}} models of {{themselves}} for their further development-and which additionally {{may be able}} to run hyperincursive routines-that is, develop only with reference to their future states-cannot exist <b>in</b> <b>res</b> extensa, but can only be envisaged <b>in</b> <b>res</b> cogitans.

Thus, intentional systems can enrich our perceptions of the cases that have happened to occur. The perspective of hindsight codified at the above-individual level enables us furthermore to intervene technologically. The theory and computation of anticipatory systems have made these loops between supra-individual hyper-incursion, individual incursion (in instantiation), and historical recursion accessible for modeling and empirical investigation.

5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's <b>in</b> <b>re</b> Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by the Civil Rights Act, slavery would not truly be abolished. With <b>In</b> <b>Re</b> Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E
