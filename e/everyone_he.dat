5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save <b>everyone.</b> <b>He</b> did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

5|$|In the 1994–95 NCAA season, {{the sophomore}} was soon {{called one of}} the best {{eligible}} NBA prospects, along with his peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early, but Duncan assured <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> had no intention of going pro until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli again {{took the}} lead in the disputation. His {{opponent}} was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing infant baptism with adult baptism. This group was led by Conrad Grebel, one of the initiators of the Anabaptist movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led {{to the question of whether}} the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from Aargau and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by <b>everyone,</b> <b>he</b> suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, Kurze, christliche Einleitung (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.|$|E

Kramer told Petrelis he was giving a speech at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on the upcoming Tuesday night, as a last-minute substitute for the scheduled speaker, writer Nora Ephron. Kramer urged Petrelis to invite <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> knew.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of The Gremlins by Random House {{consisted of a}} 50,000 run for the U.S. market with Dahl ordering 50 copies for himself as promotional material, handing them out to <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> knew, including the British Ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax, and the First Lady of the U.S. Eleanor Roosevelt, who loved to read it to her grandchildren. The book was considered an international success with 30,000 more sold in Australia but initial efforts to reprint the book were precluded by a wartime paper shortage. Reviewed in major publications, Dahl was considered a writer-of-note and his appearances in Hollywood to follow up with the film project were met with notices in Hedda Hopper's columns.|$|E
25|$|Aomame and Tengo's {{parallel}} worlds {{begin to}} draw closer to each other. Tengo is pursued {{by a private}} investigator, Ushikawa, who was hired by Sakigake. He follows Tengo in order to gather information on Air Chrysalis. Following the Leader's murder, Ushikawa is also ordered by Sakigake to determine the whereabouts of Aomame. The novel now begins to follow Ushikawa, who was once a lawyer who made a good living representing professional criminals. He got into legal trouble and had to abandon his career. His wife and two daughters left him, and ever since {{he has been working}} as a private detective. An ugly man who repels <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> meets, Ushikawa is also quite intelligent and capable of gathering facts and using logic and deductive reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Satchel Pooch is Rob's overweight, naïve, {{and easily}} amused dog. His father, named Copernicus, a Labrador Retriever and retired guide dog, and his mother, a Shar Pei, live in Cheticamp, Nova Scotia. It is {{suggested}} by Rob's friend Joe Doman, that he is named after the Baseball Hall of Fame player Satchel Paige. Satchel is kind, gentle, and sympathetic. These traits, coupled with his naïvete and gullibility, make him a natural target for the scheming Bucky. Satchel's personality serves as foil to that of Bucky's: easy to please, optimistic to the extreme, having (barely) less common sense than Bucky, and perfectly content to peacefully coexist with <b>everyone.</b> <b>He</b> is good friends with Bucky's nemesis, Fungo Squiggly, much to Bucky's dismay.|$|E

25|$|The Grub Street Opera is {{the first}} truly {{political}} play and also Fielding's first ballad opera. As such it owes a lot to Fielding's model, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Unlike his other Scriblerus plays, Fielding's Scriblerus persona in The Grub-Street Opera is deeply connected to Gay instead of Gay's fellow members of the Scriblerus Club, Alexander Pope or Jonathan Swift. As in The Welsh Opera, this connection served {{as a means to}} put forth a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. However, the play does not pick a side but pokes fun at <b>everyone.</b> <b>He</b> also kept his personal political views out of the play.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, a guy who had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the guys who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by <b>everyone.</b> <b>He</b> didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys <b>everyone</b> <b>he</b> meets, {{although}} he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
