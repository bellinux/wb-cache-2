40|$|Abstract: Inhibitory {{effect of}} 21 {{commercial}} and 6 experimental fungicides was assessed in model experiments against pearl millet downy mildew disease. Chemicals differed strongly by their anti-mildew activity, however neither the pathogen nor the host plant showed complete tolerance {{to any of}} compounds tested. Nevertheless, the plants outgrew depressant effect of compounds observed in germling stage and this activity did not significantly influence the yield. There was a significant correlation between yield performance and disease inhibitory effects assessed either in vitro or in vivo tests. The response of pathogen to investigated compounds varied during ontogeny, where zoosporangium formation {{was found to be}} the most sensitive ontogenetic event. When comparing responses of pathogen and host with fungicides by means of principal component analysis, the presence of two independent components has been demonstrated accounting for 86 % of the total variation to which responses of host and pathogen contributed differently. The antisporulant activity of compounds evaluated on detached leaf segments and their positive effect on yield significantly correlated allowing to predict the expectable grain yield significantly (p> 0. 05). Beside acylanilides andoprim, <b>drazoxolon</b> and efosit offered efficacy on the level requested. Metalaxyl an...|$|E
