2500|$|In December 2014, Vitter {{changed his}} views on common core stating [...] "After {{listening}} to literally thousands of parents, teachers and others since then, I don’t {{believe that we can}} achieve that Louisiana control, buy-in and success I’m committed to <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> in Common Core." ...|$|E
2500|$|Succintly, PROUT {{acknowledges}} that the well-being of individuals lies {{in the development of}} the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals [...] Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay. There are multifarious diseases that affect our body and mind, and even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change overtime is it’s transcendental nature, the„supra-emotional values“ intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.|$|E

60|$|I {{set out the}} {{situation}} to Robertson and Hans as briefly as I could, showing {{that there was a}} chance of life <b>if</b> <b>we</b> ran, but so far as I could see, none <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she whispered, {{approaching}} the Shaggy Man and taking his hand; [...] "let's go somewhere else. They'll surely kill us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flora smiled. [...] "The story's rather long, but I {{think you}} must be told. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> here, {{somebody}} may come in. Let's go to the breakwater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say, as {{to three}} beds,' {{interposed}} {{the gentleman who}} had spoken before; 'for we shall want three <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay,</b> though my friend only speaks of one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope it's {{more of a}} sociable place there," [...] Miss Mela {{broke in}} again. [...] "I never saw such an unsociable place as New York. We've been in this house three months, and I don't believe that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> three years any of the neighbors would call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May Christian," [...] said Sally, who {{had come}} down to see the water-party start. [...] "Two or three of us offered also to stay, father, but Jim wouldn't hear of it, an' said he would cry all the time <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed.</b> He said that May was all he wanted." ...|$|R

50|$|This {{initiative}} {{was founded in}} 2012 by Greek students in Oxford, and it spread among Greek students in other European universities. The first demonstration took place in Athens, Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections. A few hundred people participated in the demonstration demanding {{in the words of}} one of the organizers “reform and rebirth — and it would be much easier to do this <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> in the Eurozone”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll wait. I don't mind waiting. They'll keep {{dinner for}} us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> both <b>stay.</b> Besides, what matters? I'd {{do more than}} that for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He might choke hisself," [...] said Hiram, [...] "but mebbe he'll ease up <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> {{away from}} him. Now we've got to rustle to skin them two bears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} out of this," [...] said Dave, when he could speak. [...] "The Indians are after us! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> here we may be caught between two fires." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> here {{an hour or}} two it will clear off," [...] said Dave, who was {{examining}} the sky closely. [...] "I think the storm is shifting very rapidly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I had her more, I should {{understand}} her through and through. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> were {{side by side}} we should grow together. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> could <b>stay</b> here, I should get stronger and more upright.' ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I {{did know}} very well, but here, in an acute form, arose the ancient question: Were we to perish {{for the sake}} of certain {{individuals}} in whom we had no great interest and whom we could not save by remaining with them? <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> where <b>we</b> were our end seemed fairly certain, whereas <b>if</b> <b>we</b> ran for it, we had a good chance of escape. But this involved the desertion of several injured bearers and a woman and child whom we had picked up starving, all of whom would certainly be massacred, save perhaps the woman and child.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon {{everything}} will be safe <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are gone all night," [...] Jet said, as he looked around {{for the last time}} to assure himself nothing had been forgotten; [...] "but those fellows would have a pain in their jaws <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>stay</b> so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{got to get}} to {{some sort}} of shelter!" [...] cried Jack. [...] "And the sooner we get there the better. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> under the trees we'll be soaked to the skin." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't care, he {{can have}} his old place," [...] he cried angrily. [...] "We'll never get rich here, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> a hundred years. I'm {{sick and tired of}} cutting timber just for one's meals!" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were glad}} to have this woman, for we were short handed. We were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> where <b>we</b> were, our dead would kill us; <b>if</b> <b>we</b> moved out of our defenses, we should no longer be invincible. We had conquered; in turn we were conquered. The Boss {{recognized}} this; we all recognized it. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> could {{go to one of}} those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.

6000|$|... "I couldn't {{do much of}} {{anything}} with the crowd gathering around. My! how the people do flock together when the least thing happens! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> had <b>stayed</b> there another minute or two, we {{might have had a}} thousand people around us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it hadn't {{been for}} me you wouldn't have started {{on that trip}} last night. It was {{perfectly}} useless. It {{would have been better}} for us both <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had <b>stayed</b> in camp, for we wouldn't have met these people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. [...] "I {{am quite}} sure that {{is the last thing}} one would expect from anybody at the cañon, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> here Katty will be {{wondering}} what has become of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave that to me. I would manage it, and {{you could}} join with some other old person. We shall kill each other <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> like this," [...] said Arabella as she took up her candle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, {{and judge}} for yourself, sir. There she comes, like a race-horse, {{and if she}} holds her present course, she must pass somewhere within {{a mile or so}} of us, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were indeed; but not {{far behind}} us the tide of {{population}} pours across the plain, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had <b>stayed</b> {{a year or two}} in the timber, it would have caught us up. That flood won't stop until it reaches the Polar Sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We might remain {{here for}} ever, Chapeau, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> {{for the very}} last of all," [...] said the Chevalier, as he jumped on the raft. [...] "Come, man, get on, we've our number now, and we couldn't take more, if they come. There's some one hallooing up there, and we'll leave the little boat for them. Come, I want to get over and have a run on dry land, for I'm as cold as a stone. This living like a duck, half {{in the water and}} half out, don't suit me at all. The next river we cross over, I'll make Henri get another ferryman." ...|$|R
