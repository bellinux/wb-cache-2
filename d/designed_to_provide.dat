5|$|The Lexington Avenueâ€“63rd Street {{subway station}} has two island platforms, which were {{originally}} built with now-demolished walls on their northern sides. The platforms were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a cross-platform interchange to the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|It is {{strongly}} recommended by diver training organisations and {{codes of practice}} that {{a portion of the}} usable gas of the cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve. The reserve is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental {{training}} modules are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These shorter {{training sessions}} are often provided at the Roundtable, a monthly meeting of {{leaders from the}} district, at a University of Scouting offered by the local councils, and at National Training Conferences held at the Philmont Training Center and the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base.|$|E

5|$|The Su-25BM target-tower was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> towed target {{facilities}} for training ground forces and naval personnel in ground-to-air or naval surface-to-air missile systems. It {{is powered by}} an R-195 engine and equipped with an RSDN-10 long-range navigation system, an analogue of the Western LORAN system.|$|E
5|$|The Super-Heavy Lift Launcher (SHLL) would {{consist of}} a new {{cryogenic}} main stage, five liquid fly-back boosters, and a re-ignitable injection stage. This configuration was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> increased capabilities for complex missions, including manned explorations to the Moon and to Mars, {{as well as the}} launch of large solar-powered satellites.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately all {{of these}} {{problems}} {{were considered to be}} well understood, and a much larger design emerged, NIF. NIF was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> about twice the required driver energy, allowing some margin of error. NIF's design was finalized in 1994, with construction to be completed by 2002. Construction began in 1997 but took over a decade to complete, with major construction being declared complete in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as immediate-release tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning. A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation {{is available}} under the brand Adderall XR and is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local {{government}} system {{known as the}} Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government. Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.|$|E
5|$|GO Transit {{stations}} are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> seamless and barrier-free connections between its trains and buses. They include amenities such as elevators, washrooms, parking, pay phones, ticket vending machines, ticket sale kiosks and automated teller machines. All GO stations have Presto card readers. Most bus terminals are also {{served with a}} ticket sales booth or vending machine. As of 2016, the capital costs of building a GO Transit train station is about $50 to $75 million.|$|E
50|$|In fact, it is a {{stated goal}} of battery <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a voltage as {{constant}} as possible {{no matter the}} SoC, which makes this method difficult to apply.|$|R

30|$|From a {{practical}} perspective, the pre-task {{was essential to}} the overall task <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a dual focus on cooking and language. It was divided into presentation and preparation of language and cooking knowledge.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, the Somali Civil War {{drew the}} world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide {{humanitarian}} assistance, primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched {{the first of}} 26,000 U.S. troops to Somalia {{as part of the}} Unified Task Force (UNITAF), <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> security and food relief. Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin and William J. Perry, had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.|$|E
5|$|Launched in July 2015, Paul Allen {{is funding}} the Global FinPrint initiative, a three-year survey of {{sharks and rays}} in coral reef areas. The survey is the largest of its kind and <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> data to help {{conservation}} programs. The initiative is a partnership between Allen's Vulcan Inc, Stony Brook University, Florida International University, James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Survey results will be made available in summer 2018.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> {{destroyer}} flotillas with a command ship, theoretically offering {{the ability to}} scout ahead {{of the group and}} locate targets for the smaller ships to attack. They were enlarged and more powerfully armed versions of the earlier ships, fitted with steam turbines. Curiously, they were no faster than the older ships and equally unsuccessful in their intended role as they lacked the speed of the destroyers they were supposed to escort.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} {{developed}} the GEN 125, {{a very small}} , twin-cylinder, two-stroke aircraft engine to power the H-4. The engine weighs 3 kg and four {{are used in the}} H-4 <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> redundancy.|$|R
30|$|Monorail systems today must employ {{international}} {{mass transit}} standards {{in all aspects}} of vehicle and system <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> durable and safe operations. As with any elevated transit system, monorail systems are no exception, requiring emergency walkway <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> assured means of evacuation.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, we {{aimed to}} {{establish}} robust and valid dosage algorithms by a PBPK modeling approach using different virtual trial <b>designs</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> similar tamoxifen metabolic patterns in CYP 2 D 6 IM or PM versus EM patients.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with the principles of the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|Skis used in {{cross-country}} are {{lighter and}} narrower than {{those used in}} alpine skiing. Ski bottoms are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E
5|$|The Adenhart family {{created the}} Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund, which is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> {{financial}} support to youth baseball organizations. The goal is to lend a helping hand to struggling leagues {{around the country to}} buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in Halfway, Maryland. Two annual events, the Nick Adenhart 5K Run and Walk and the Nick Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.|$|E

5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. It was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It {{had the same}} body and chassis as the M5 Half-track (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|The Sunderland Echo is {{an evening}} {{newspaper}} serving the Sunderland, South Tyneside and East Durham areas of North East England. The newspaper {{was founded by}} Samuel Storey, Edward Backhouse, Edward Temperley Gourley, Charles Palmer, Richard Ruddock, Thomas Glaholm and Thomas Scott Turnbull in 1873, as the Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. <b>Designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a platform for the Radical views held by Storey and his partners, it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> {{reverse thrust}} after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers {{to a point}} below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
40|$|Offner relay optics {{added to}} large {{spaceborne}} telescope <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> improved capability for fine pointing. Performs telescope fine pointing by tilting relatively small relay secondary mirror, instead of pointing entire telescope. Reimaged pupil within relay {{also allows for}} cost-effective stray-light control...|$|R
50|$|In late 1990, the US {{partnership}} expressed {{similar concerns}} and {{embarked on an}} upgrade to the existing Sidewinder <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> increased maneuverability and IRCCM (infrared counter counter measures) performance, i.e. measures to counter infrared countermeasures (IRCM). This program was designated AIM-9X.|$|R
