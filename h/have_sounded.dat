5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> the four-minute warning alarm {{in the event of}} war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E

This was the third false station alarm during the STS-129 mission. The two previous alarms originated in the new Russian Poisk module.|$|E
25|$|The Smile Sessions is a {{compilation}} album and box set recorded by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on October 31, 2011 by Capitol Records. The set focuses on abandoned recording sessions from their unfinished 1966–67 album Smile which – if completed – would {{have followed the}} group's 11th studio album Pet Sounds. It features comprehensive session highlights and outtakes, while the first 19 tracks comprise an approximation of what the completed album might <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like.|$|E
25|$|A 1982 VFA {{match between}} Frankston and Geelong West ended in similar circumstances. The {{controlling}} umpire failed {{to hear the}} siren, allowing Geelong West's Simon Taylor to kick the winning goal after time expired, while the non-controlling umpire heard the siren and signalled the end of play; the two umpires conferred and awarded the goal. Frankston appealed the result, but the appeal was rejected. As in the St Kilda vs Fremantle match, the Association found that the timekeeper should <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> the siren for longer.|$|E

25|$|Puffing Billy is {{a replica}} of an {{original}} locomotive built in 1813/14, making it the world's oldest surviving steam locomotive, being a static exhibit in the Science Museum in London. The Beamish replica was built over four years, being completed in 2006. The original was designed by William Hedley for Wylam Colliery, where it saw use on the Wylam to Lemington waggonway for nearly 50 years. The name is said to derive from its owner, {{who is said to}} <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like his new locomotive due to a breathing difficulty which he suffered from.|$|E
25|$|Walter's work is {{documented}} {{on hundreds of}} recordings made between 1900 (when he was 24) and 1961. Most listeners became familiar with him through the stereo recordings made in his last few years, when his health was declining. But many critics agree that these recordings do not fully convey what Walter's art must <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like in its prime. The late recordings {{are said to have}} a geniality that contrast with the energetic, intense and mercurial performances of earlier decades. Furthermore, Walter's late recordings focus mostly on older compositions, whereas in his youth he often conducted what was then considered newer music.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> to him like a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E

500|$|In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis {{wrote that}} the album [...] "offers a plethora of low-key delights", but [...] "you can't help imagining what it might <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like if Yorke had {{turned it over to}} Radiohead." [...] The Village Voice praised Yorke's vocals, but found that [...] "without the hooks of his inspirations or [...] density, the results offer pleasantries where they could provoke {{profound}} unpleasantries." [...] Pitchfork wrote that The Eraser is [...] "strikingly beautiful and thuddingly boring in maddeningly equal measure." ...|$|E
500|$|The stage blood caused {{technical}} difficulties as it soaked the microphone, guitars, and cymbals, {{which according to}} Shirley sounded like [...] "coffee mugs being tapped with a spoon". A review of the DVD observed that [...] "If it wasn't for guitarist Jeff Hanneman being out of position and missing all of the blood, the guitar might <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> pretty bad." [...] Hanneman missed the initial downpour due to a technical problem with his guitar, and was deluged by a light shower when coming back on-stage.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion about}} Freewheelin has been {{consistently}} favorable {{in the years since}} its release. Dylan biographer Howard Sounes called it [...] "Bob Dylan's first great album". In a survey of Dylan's work published by Q magazine in 2000, the Freewheelin’ album was described as [...] "easily the best of [...] acoustic albums and a quantum leap from his debut—which shows the frantic pace at which Dylan's mind was moving." [...] The magazine went on to comment, [...] "You can see why this album got The Beatles listening. The songs at its core must <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like communiques from another plane." ...|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Fremantle players {{began to}} {{celebrate}} {{what they thought}} was a one-point victory. Nicholls, however, did not hear the siren and refused to listen to the claims of Fremantle players, particularly Byron Schammer, that the siren <b>had</b> <b>sounded.</b> He also did not confer with the other two umpires as to whether the siren <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> before restarting play.|$|R

500|$|In their 1975 book , NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler {{similarly}} {{approved of}} Harrison's husky singing on [...] "Dark Horse", praising it as [...] "definitely a style to pursue". Like Carr and Tyler, Nicholas Schaffner rated [...] "Dark Horse" [...] among Harrison's finest compositions. Writing in The Beatles Forever, Schaffner opined that [...] "Dark Horse" [...] {{could have been}} one of Harrison's most successful singles had he [...] "only waited to recoup his voice before committing it to tape". Seven years after his unfavourable review in the NME, Woffinden acknowledged that the song would <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "really good" [...] had it been [...] "graced with good vocals" [...] and released in a [...] "different context".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue of Extra Texture, for The Second Disc, Joe Marchese {{highlights}} [...] "the touching 'The Answer's at the End'" [...] {{among the}} [...] "top-drawer material" [...] {{found on the}} album. In his review for Paste magazine, Robert Ham views the song as a [...] " [...] when Harrison's focus returns" [...] on Extra Texture {{and one of the}} album's ballads that [...] "cut deep". New Zealand music critic Graham Reid writes that [...] "the melancholy and string-enhanced The Answer's At the End makes a lovely plea", and he suggests that had Harrison recorded the track with Phil Spector, it [...] "might not <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> out of place" [...] on All Things Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some critics}} hailed the track as a 'return to form' for the band, with the Manchester Evening News {{describing}} the song as a [...] "the best that the Furries <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> in ages ... {{a return to}} the mellow-but-bouncy pop fare of their early albums Fuzzy Logic and Guerilla", others pointed out that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] is [...] "ponderously mature", rather [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "more like the generic pop songs one would find on the radio than [...] of a historically experimental band". However, The Guardian stated that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] "is the sort of music [...] do best - hazy, lazy sunshine pop". And while Cokemachineglow [...] believed the track [...] "may not have the staying power or the immediate pull of the Super Furry Animals' best singles" [...] their reviewer conceded that [...] "it's not too far behind".|$|E

500|$|Prabhu {{states that}} the charge that the Christians {{constituted}} a united front cannot be sustained. Apart from divergent viewpoints among the Christian community at the time, he argues that difficulties in communication for a minority Christian population spread over a [...] forested coastline broken by numerous streams and rivers, would have made united action practically impossible. He further {{states that the}} majority of Mangalorean Catholics were agriculturists farming land capable of growing three crops a year. The idea of neglecting their fields in the cause of a small band of British isolated in the confines of a fort besieged by a large Mysorean army would <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> insane. Even if the British had made promises, they would have had little effect on the militarily inexperienced Christians, who would then have had to fight a large and well-trained army in support of a beleaguered army which was not even successful.|$|E
500|$|... "Climbing Up the Walls" [...] – {{described}} by Melody Maker as [...] "monumental chaos" [...] – is layered {{with a string}} section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, [...] "I got very excited {{at the prospect of}} doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> like for the past 30 years." [...] Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as [...] "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo." [...] For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the Community policy of deinstitutionalizing mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers.|$|E
500|$|The album has had [...] "a slow {{progress}} to critical darlinghood"; {{for the most}} part, audiences have remained nonplussed. According to Simon Goddard, most critics regard it as [...] " [...] defining avant-garde masterpiece". The Rolling Stone Album Guide considers The Marble Index the point in Nico's discography where [...] "the difficult listening starts", and the album is [...] "pretty amazing for it". Anthony Carew of About.com called it [...] "a suite of rootless songs written with little precedent" [...] and [...] "an astonishing haunting, {{the work of a}} woman who, even whilst alive, seemed a lot like a ghost". Anthony Thornton of NME called it an [...] "artistic triumph": [...] "Bleak but beautiful, this album remains the most fitting embodiment of her doomed glamour." [...] According to Spin, [...] "Few records, before or since, <b>have</b> <b>sounded</b> lonelier, spookier, or more desolate".
