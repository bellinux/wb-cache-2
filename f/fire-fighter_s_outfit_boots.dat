50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{a section of}} land near {{junction}} 9 of the M6 motorway was designated as the location for a new retail development. The first retailer to move onto the site was Ikea, who opened their superstore in January 1991. Throughout the 1990s, the retail park expanded to include several more large units, although most of these were empty by 2009 due to the recession. However, most of the units were occupied again by 2012 and the retail park is now home to retailers including Next, TK Maxx, <b>Outfit,</b> <b>Boots,</b> Curry's, B&Q and B&M.

50|$|But the {{description}} of the muki changes with time. Around the 1930s, he was said to wander the mines while holding a gas lantern and wearing a vicuña poncho. He was described as having two small shiny horns and to speak with a soft voice. Nowadays he has a more updated look: mining <b>outfit,</b> rain <b>boots</b> and a battery flashlight. Sometimes he shape shifts into an animal or a blonde white man to appear to the miners and deceive them.|$|R

He would also wear Cuban-heeled shoes with most of his outfits. He would also wear suits with tailed jackets and ruffled shirts (most notably cream-coloured or reddish-pink). Over the next three seasons, the Cat began wearing flashier outfits (like a tartan three-piece suit) and more leather and vinyl <b>outfits</b> (with <b>boots).</b> He also began wearing brightly coloured hats and coats, such as his zebra-print coat (later revamped to yellow and black). He began sporting more jewellery and earrings.|$|R
5000|$|Korra for {{the first}} three seasons is {{depicted}} with long hair that is usually kept in a ponytail, though she has it down on several occasions such as when attending festivities, while entering the Avatar State by the Red Lotus and during her battle with Zaheer shortly afterward. Korra is so rarely seen with her hair down that DiMartino wrote that whenever the character had her hair down, [...] "you know something bad has happened." [...] She maintains the hairstyle {{for the next three years}} as she recovers until shortly after regaining her mobility, at which point she cuts it. The hairstyle change was revealed in September 2014 by Konietzko, who wrote that the character was returning to her roots by sporting a bob cut similar to the one she was given by Dos Santos in his original concept for her, Konietzko adding that the alteration was carrying on a tradition in the Avatar franchise to have hairstyle changes over the course of a series. Korra's initial clothing in the fourth season is purposely designed to mirror that of her Water Tribe attire in the previous seasons, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants, DiMartino finding it paramount that it resemble her prior clothing due to the duration for which she wore it. Korra gains another outfit midway through the fourth season. This <b>outfit's</b> <b>boots</b> are based on an existing pair of faux suede flat winter buckle boots.|$|R

50|$|Under the new {{homestead}} law, settlers began {{purchasing the}} “even-numbered” sections {{from the state}} {{for the benefit of}} the Common School Fund in 1883. In conjunction with the introduction of the fence, these settlers began owning land that was previously controlled by the large cattle outfits, and this eventually led to the Fence Cutting Wars. This acreage was sold by the state on a first-come, first-served basis with the county advertising the availability of land, which resulted in extremely long lines at the county clerks' offices and increased the likelihood that the desired acreage would not be available. As a result of Common School Fund process, W.R. McEntire, while in Dallas, sent representatives from Tom Green County to acquire as much land as possible and to keep others out of the line until the desired acreage was obtained. North Carolinian James Jefferson Lafayott Glass came to the county in 1883 and signed on with the Sterling Brothers’ Half Circle <b>S</b> <b>outfit.</b> He later homesteaded acreage along the Lacy Creek.|$|R

He also walks like a duck because his feet are of abnormal size, and sometimes his legs can take the shape of a goose or crow’s.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1977, {{the racing}} sidecars {{were similar to}} road-going sidecars. A {{traditional}} racing outfit was a road-going motorcycle <b>outfit</b> without the <b>boot</b> and with the suspension lowered. The bootless sidecar frame would have a flat platform. Both the battery and the fuel tank could be placed either between the motorcycle and the sidecar, or on the sidecar platform. Over time the subframe, struts, clamps, sidecar frame, etc. would merge with the motorcycle mainframe and form a single frame. But essentially the racing outfit was still {{a variant of the}} road-going outfit in principle.|$|R
40|$|Looking back at {{the history}} of Japanese textiles, the {{beginning}} seems to be braiding and/or netting fibers made from tree bark or tall grass (Jomon period - approximately C 13 th - C 10 th BC.). Weaving seems to appear after the mid-Jomon period. Silk was brought into Japan in the late-Jomon to the Yayoi period (600 BC- 200 AD), {{and for a long time}} its use was restricted to the upper class. During the Momoyama period (1573 - 1603) cotton seeds were introduced and cotton grown in Japan. By the mid-Edo period (1603 - 1868) cotton cultivation had spread over the southern part of Japan, and cotton became available to commoners. According to Kunio Yanagida, until cotton became known to the ordinary people in the 17 th century, they wore cloth made form bast fibers, such as hemp, ramie, kaju (paper mulberry), liden, wisteria, etc. Garments made from tree or grass fibre have been used to protect ordinary people for a few thousand years. Many stories have been told about the brilliant silk fabrics of japan but little is known about bast fibre cloth. Ordinary people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>outfits</b> appear in old picture scrolls and we can guess they may have been made form bast fibres, however few actual examples survive. they were worn out so completely that the tiny fragments left were used as part of the fuel supply for the fireplaces...|$|R
