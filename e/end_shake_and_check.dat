5000|$|He {{was an avid}} {{basketball}} player in high school, who was nicknamed [...] "Touch" [...] by his teammates. During World War II, {{he served in the}} United States Army Air Forces. After the war, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles on a basketball scholarship, where he briefly played under coach John Wooden. He {{was a member of the}} Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Director William A. Wellman got him into acting after noticing his expressive face while Connors was playing basketball. He appeared on the Los Angeles CBS station as Touch Connors in an episode of Jukebox Jury before the program went national via ABC in 1953. Connors is credited in his early films, such as Sudden Fear (1952), Island in the Sky (1953), Swamp Women (Swamp Diamonds), Five Guns West (1955), The Day the World <b>Ended</b> (1955), <b>Shake,</b> Rattle <b>and</b> Rock (1956), and Flesh and the Spur (1957) as [...] "Touch Connors".|$|R
5000|$|Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings was {{produced}} by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers bassist Howie Epstein, who produced Prine's 1991 Grammy Winning comeback album The Missing Years. The album features several songs Prine co-wrote with Nashville veteran Gary Nicholson and includes contributions from guitarist Waddy Wachtel and Marianne Faithfull. It was recorded, as The Missing Years had been, at Huh Sound Theater, Los Angeles and Pacifique Recording Studios, North Hollywood - which was really Epstein’s house - and featured {{many of the same}} musicians that played on the previous album. However, Prine told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel in 1995, “I didn’t want to {{try to come up with}} The Missing Years II. Sure, it came out big and shiny, but it won’t help if you put horns on it if the songs aren’t good." [...] Prine also admitted that he and Epstein had come to the end of their working relationship: [...] "We kinda overextended ourselves on Lost Dogs...I think we were pretty tired of each other. At the <b>end,</b> we <b>shook</b> hands <b>and</b> said, ‘OK, we did it.’” ...|$|R
40|$|Newmark {{method of}} slope {{displacement}} analysis {{has been extensively}} applied in many slope stability analyses. However, there are some limitations in Newmark method {{that may lead to}} non-conservative predictions of slope displacements. To provide more realistic predictions of slope displacements, these limitations are considered throughout the study for enhancing Newmark method. The following additions to the original Newmark method have been included in this study: 1) accounting for seismically induced excess pore water pressure build-up, 2) accounting for excess pore water pressure dissipation after the <b>end</b> of <b>shaking,</b> <b>and</b> 3) accounting for possibility of multiple failure surfaces. Those enhancements are briefly discussed hereafter. [...] During an earthquake, non-cohesive soils may experience considerable pore water pressure build-up, which in the limit can lead to a state of zero effective stress and soil liquefaction. Therefore, in such a case, an effective stress approach should be used because a total stress analysis may give highly under-conservative results. In the present effective stress approach, the effects of excess pore water pressure and subsequent changes in soil shear strength are considered. [...] Also, {{after the end of the}} strong shaking period, pore water pressure starts dissipating. Dissipation of excess pore water pressure causes the soil to regain part of its original shear strength and consequently, the yield acceleration increases and becomes positive. Therefore, in such a case, considering the effects of excess pore water pressure dissipation gives better estimation of permanent slope displacements after the <b>end</b> of <b>shaking.</b> In this study the effects of excess pore water pressure dissipation are also considered, based on the one-dimensional consolidation theory. [...] In homogeneous soil deposits the displacements are usually dist 1 ibuted with depth. For such situation, the rigid block assumption may induce significant differences between actual and predicted slope displacements. Therefore, two moving blocks have been considered to mitigate this limitation of Newmark method. The model is able to reproduce the gradual deformation of soil with depth and therefore provide a more realistic prediction for uniform sand deposits. [...] The proposed enhanced Newmark method has been implemented in a computer program...|$|R

CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire {{to know what was going}} to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the <b>end,</b> I felt <b>shaken</b> <b>and</b> exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and whether they are associated with co-sleeping. In Japan, co-sleeping is common during infancy and early childhood. This study investigates the prevalence of <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering and their associations with co-sleeping among 4 -month-old infants in Japan. A questionnaire was administered to mothers who participated in a 4 -month health checkup program in Kamagaya City in Japan (n = 1307; valid response rate, 82 %). The questionnaire investigated the frequency of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering during the past one month, co-sleeping status, and living arrangements with grandparents, in addition to traditional risk factors such as stress due to crying. Associations between co-sleeping <b>and</b> self-reported <b>shaking</b> or smothering were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of self-reported <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering at least one time during the past one month was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 2. 4 %– 4. 3 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI, 1. 5 %– 3. 2 %), respectively. Co-sleeping was marginally associated {{with the amount of}} crying and not associated with stress due to crying. Further, co-sleeping was not associated with either self-reported shaking or smothering, although stress due to crying showed strong association with <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering. Co-sleeping was not a risk factor for <b>shaking</b> <b>and</b> smothering...|$|R
