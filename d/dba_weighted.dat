40|$|The {{results of}} a recent wind tunnel test program to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Tip Air Mass Injection (TAMI) system in modifying the blade tip vortex occurring during helicopter flight is described with attention to the effect of this modification on the impulsive noise. The measurement program is explained, and the correlation between experimental and predicted results is discussed. Topics considered include the effect of descent rate on noise pressure time histories, the effect of air mass injection on noise, and the analysis based on a <b>dB(A)</b> <b>weighted</b> approach. Impulsive noise generated by the interaction of a helicopter rotor blade and the concentrated tip vortex during forward flight descent is a primary contributor to acoustic annoyance as it draws early attention to the presence of the helicopter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract; e {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} of diff erent sound levels with hypertension and prehypertension in Pakistani population. A cross sectional {{study was conducted to}} determine the prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension due to exposure of sound level ≤ <b>dBA</b> (A <b>weighted</b> sound pressure level), - dBA and ≥ dBA in November, to January,. Sites were selected with stable sound ranges according to the above mentioned crite-ria. After selecting sampling sites, workers living in that area for at least hours per day were categorized on the basis of blood pressure in groups called as normotensive, prehypertensive and hypertensive. Persons with diabetes, chronic bacterial or viral infections, alcohol addiction, kidney problems were excluded from the study. For getting homogenous groups, age range of - years was selected. Out of samples, excluded samples were consisted of dia-betic patients, hepatitis C patients, hepatitis B patients and AIDS patients. Out of participants, samples were found with age ± years. High noise increased the risks of hypertension (Odds ratio:.; Confi dence interval:. -,) and prehypertension (Odds ratio:,; Confi dence Interval:,-,) as compared to the normal sound level. How-ever increased chances of hypertension (Odds ratio:,; Confi dence interval:,-,) and prehypertension (Odds ratio:,; Confi dence Interval:,-,) were observed on median noise exposure also.; ese fi ndings suggest that sound level more than dBA increas-es the chances for development of hypertension and prehypertension in Pakistani population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of this work is to measure, evaluate and study the noise exposure from auto rickshaws in running condition in Kolkata city of India. Statistical Regression analysis is done among the different parameters like LAeq, L 90, and calculated parameters like TNI and Lnp. TWA (Time Weighted Average) values are given as an output by the Noise Dosimeter. While Lnp (Equivalent Noise Pollution) and TNI (Traffic Noise Index) are computed using the standard formula, TNI (Traffic Noise Index) is maximum in summer (152. 08 dBA) and Lnp (Equivalent Noise Pollution) is maximum in monsoon (130. 78 <b>dBA).</b> TWA (Time <b>Weighted</b> Average) is 58. 81 dBA. It is found from correlation coefficient data, the winter data set (LAeq vs. L 90) is the most linearly correlated (r 2 = 0. 490). TNI and Lnp for different runs in summer (r 2 = 0. 750) and winter (r 2 = 0. 451), data follow polynomial trend line of order two. This study suggests that noise exposure and {{noise induced hearing loss}} can interfere with the safety of driver daily life, since working in such places noise dose exceeded 89 dBA is more dangerous causing deafness due to extreme environmental pollution...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the contribution of noise exposures from personal media player (PMP) use in the workplace to overall employee noise exposures at a Colorado manufacturing facility. A total of 24 workers’ PMP and background noise exposures were measured. Twelve PMP users worked in high-background-noise exposure (HBNE) areas and 12 employees worked in low-background-noise exposure (LBNE) areas. The self-selected PMP listening level of each worker was measured using an ear simulator, and the background noise of each employee workstation was measured using a sound level meter (SLM). The workers 2 ̆ 7 self-reported PMP duration of use, PMP listening exposure levels, and background noise levels, were used to estimate the daily occupational noise exposures. The measured background noise levels averaged 81 dBA for HBNE workers and 59 dBA for LBNE workers. The measured, free-field equivalent listening exposure levels were significantly greater for HBNE workers (85 dBA) as compared to LBNE workers (75 dBA) (p= 0. 0006). The estimated mean daily noise exposures for both groups were below the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value for noise of 85 <b>dBA</b> eight-hour time <b>weighted</b> average (TWA), specifically 84 dBA TWA for HBNE workers and 72 dBA TWA for LBNE workers.
