The article suggests that instead of acting as a neutral assessment of people’s financial literacy, the measure, in fact, embodies gendered assumptions about finance and financial practices.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{descriptive}} analysis of socio-demographic bases of gender gap in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes various aspects of <b>gender</b> gap (<b>gender</b> <b>inequalities)</b> in Pakistan. The analysis is based on the secondary data drawn from reports published by several governmental, international development agencies, and local non-governmental organizations. The analysis is descriptive in nature and interprets certain social and demographic data to ascertain the states of affairs about the prevailing social conditions relating to <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> in Pakistan. Besides review of literature, the paper focuses on sectoral discussion of gender gap in population, health, education, political, and economic empowerment. In light of the secondary data analysis, suggestions to improve the current <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> and possible recommendations to improve the current <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> in Pakistan are also given. Findings – The paper demonstrates that there are significant socio-demographic and cultural factors, due to which gender gap persists in Pakistani society. Research limitations/implications – The current analysis is based on secondary and published data and, therefore lacks empirical reliability. However, published quantitative data reveal certain social characteristics of gender gap.

5|$|Buddhism {{was popular}} {{in the time of}} Ashoka but {{vanished}} by the 12th century CE. Certain Hindu communities such as the Kshatriyas, certain Ambalavasi castes, Nairs, Tiyyas and the Muslims around North Malabar used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as marumakkathayam, although this practice ended in the years after Indian independence. Other Muslims, Christians, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris, most of the Ambalavasi castes and the Ezhavas followed makkathayam, a patrilineal system. Owing to the former matrilineal system, women in Kerala enjoy a high social status.

Key empirical findings include: the identification of a particularly vulnerable group using data for men and women separately; <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> in the propensity to experience different forms of violence; <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> in the impact of key factors, such as the number of dependent children, employment status, income (household and personal) and education, on the likelihood of experiencing violence; a strong link between experienced domestic violence and vulnerability to future domestic violence for women; and strong evidence of the negative impact of self-assessed vulnerability on well-being. violence, <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities,</b> the capabilities approach, crime, happiness, income...|$|R
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was <b>gender</b> <b>inequality.</b> Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the <b>gender</b> <b>inequality</b> that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} online: 19 June 2015 Using {{retrospective data}} from the Russian Education and Employment Survey (EES), we examine labour market entry in Russia in terms of changes in horizontal gender segregation and vertical <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> {{before and after the}} collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991. Our results provide evidence for horizontal gender segregation across branches of the economy among labour market entrants in Russia, which have been growing since 1991. Moreover, horizontal differences seem to be driving vertical <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> in terms of entry into authoritative positions. Accounting for heterogeneity in education and the entered branch, we find that despite gender equality principles and full-time employment for women, vertical <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> had already existed under the Soviet regime. However, these increased during the liberalization reforms. These growing vertical <b>gender</b> <b>inequalities</b> can be traced back mainly to a worsening of female chances in an economic transition, whereas there was no significant change for male entrants. Furthermore, women seem to be particularly disadvantaged among highly qualified entrants. We conclude that Russian female entrants have not fully converted their educational advantage into occupational opportunities since the transition from socialism to a liberalized market economy...|$|R
25|$|The most {{frequently}} cited indicator of <b>gender</b> <b>inequality</b> is the United Nation's <b>Gender</b> <b>Inequality</b> Index, or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did not measure <b>gender</b> <b>inequality</b> directly. It measured female development. The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated <b>gender</b> <b>inequality</b> in poor countries. Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws {{and to be a}} true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>inequality,</b> however, is not {{increasing}} or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, <b>gender</b> <b>inequality,</b> {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease <b>gender</b> <b>inequality,</b> nothing definitive can be said about the level of <b>gender</b> <b>inequality</b> or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E
