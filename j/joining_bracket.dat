50|$|Before {{the day of}} the event, all {{attending}} {{teams are}} sorted into 12 pools of 5 based on their seeding. Seeding is based on a complex algorithm measuring each team's wins, point differentials, snitch grab percentages and strength of schedule at their respective Regional Championships. After each team plays the other four in their pool, all the teams are ranked by the same algorithm. The top 28 teams get a spot in a seeded round-robin <b>bracket</b> and 29-36 <b>join</b> the play-in round, a pre-bracket playoff round of four games to determine the last 4 teams to <b>join</b> the <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Second Phase {{began with}} a {{classification}} round where the 16 non-champion teams of the B Nacional determined the 8 teams to move forward. The next round saw the 24 teams from the first phase, the 8 winners of the previous round, the remaining champion teams of the Primera B Nacional (Huracán, Ferro Carril Oeste, Rosario Central, and Banfield), and the 12 non-champion teams from the Primera Division in four brackets. The 8 champion teams (River Plate, Boca Juniors, Independiente, Vélez Sársfield, Racing, San Lorenzo, Estudiantes (LP), and Newell's Old Boys) <b>joined</b> the <b>bracket</b> with 24 winning teams.|$|R

Principal Mr Sanjay Suar and Head International Curriculum Ms Emma Pacilli {{were invited to}} Delhi to receive an award for the same. KiiT International School was ranked as the best residential school of Odisha, and is among the top twenty residential schools of India (Education World, 2012). The school has <b>joined</b> the elite <b>bracket</b> of A+++ schools of India (The Pioneer). There are only 19 schools in the league. The school has Padmashree Ruskin Bond as its brand ambassador.|$|R
50|$|Davenport and Petter {{designed}} {{an aircraft}} to incorporate these features with unconventional results. The Lysander was {{powered by a}} Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine and had high wings and a fixed conventional landing gear faired inside large, streamlined spats. The spats had mountings for small, removable stub wings {{that could be used}} to carry light bombs or supply canisters. The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin tube <b>joined</b> with <b>brackets</b> and plates, and the after part was welded stainless steel tubes. Plates and brackets were cut from channel extrusions rather than forming from sheet steel. The front spar and lift struts were extrusions. The wing itself was fabric covered, and with its thickness maximized at the lift strut anchorage location, similar to that of later marks of the Stinson Reliant high-winged transport monoplane.|$|R
50|$|Ranakpur {{village is}} home to {{important}} Jain temples. 400+ marble pillars support the temple. Opposite the Jain temple is the much older Sun Temple.Temples of Ranakpur present a distinct style of their own. The ceilings of the temples are adorned with foliate scrollwork and geometric patterns. The top and bottom part of the domes are <b>joined</b> by <b>Brackets</b> with figures of deities on them. The most important amongst all the temples within the complex is the Chaumukha Temple. Dedicated to the first Jain Tirthankara, Adinath, it is a four faced temple which has a basement of 48000 sq ft. The temple boasts of four subsidiary shrines, 24 pillared halls and 80 domes standing on the support of nearly 400 columns (the total number of columns in the temple complex, however, is much larger, around 1444). Each of the columns is richly carved and interestingly no two columns present the same design. Moreover, the columns change colour from golden to pale blue {{with the passage of}} every hour during the day.|$|R

40|$|The Composite Fitting Attachment (COFA) {{system was}} {{developed}} by Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) to <b>join</b> thermoplastic (TP) <b>brackets</b> to carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) using ultrasonic welding. This complex process means experimental characterisation of the joint is crucial. Three aspects of the joint formation were investigated: weld development over time, temperature in the weld and surrounding laminate, and failure loads of the joint. Weld development over time was investigated using cross sectional micrographs, differential scanning calorimetry and hot stage. This indicated under a given set of weld parameters, the energy director of the COFA joint started to collapse after 0. 025 secs of ultrasonic vibration and collapse distance is directly proportional to the input actuator energy. Various spherulite sizes were observed at the joint interface divided by striations suggesting varying cooling rates in the TP during resolidification. Minimal percentage crystallinity changes using various cooling rates were measured. Interface and through thickness laminate temperatures were measured using thermocouples. Measured interface temperatures were in excess of 500 °C and 300 °C for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. Maximum times for which any portion of the laminates measured above 200 °C were under 1 second and just over 1 second for joints welded at 20 kHz and 40 kHz, respectively. These short times {{are expected to be}} insufficient to allow thermal degradation of the laminates during welding. Failure test of COFA joint were performed under axial, transverse and shear loads. The shear load test case was newly developed to fully characterise the load-bearing capabilities of the joint. All tests passed the 200 N requirement. Transverse loading applied at 90 ° to the CFRP's first ply is the critical load case. Three different failure mechanisms were observed including CFRP laminate damage through first ply fibre pull out.
