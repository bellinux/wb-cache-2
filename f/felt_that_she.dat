5|$|After her mother's {{death in}} August 1962, Valiente <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{could be more}} open about being a Wiccan herself.|$|E

She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her previous work in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to be extra careful.|$|E
5|$|Hershey {{landed a}} role in Richard Rush's The Stunt Man (1980), marking {{a return to the}} big screen after four years and earning her {{critical}} praise. Hershey <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be forever in debt to Rush for fighting with financiers to allow her a part in that film. She also felt The Stunt Man was an important transition for her, from playing girls to playing women.|$|E

60|$|And so {{she made}} her promise. And, knowing Pomona, I <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would keep it--if she could.|$|R
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would not recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
60|$|Carrie laughed, for she {{was unwilling}} to admit she had any apprehensions. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>she</b> did so, they might become oppressive.|$|R

5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role {{is that of a}} surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was a strong}} addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as signs of the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing her}} job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest {{daughter}} was a student. Boisselier began {{to travel to}} discuss Clonaid, eventually becoming a high-profile speaker. Around that time, she reached the rank of Bishop within Raëlism. She {{was one of the}} 25 members closest to Raël and joined the group's Order of Angels, which promoted free love and femininity. She moved to the United States and began teaching at State University of New York at Plattsburgh for a short time before moving to Hamilton College in 2000 to teach chemistry. Her association with Clonaid was publicized in the U.S. in February 2001, and she resigned her academic position that May, although she had a three-year contract. She claimed she was initially popular at Hamilton College, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was disrespected after her association with Clonaid was publicized.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could learn about Cicero.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 runs from their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their {{response}} well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 runs from just 13 balls {{before she was}} run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 runs from their 20 overs by a economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs for the Stars late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 runs from their opening partnership, including 41 runs from 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, but then a spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining.|$|E

30|$|However, {{the student}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} <b>she</b> {{did not succeed}} in achieving the original goal, ugly helped her to see life’s difficulties more structurally. She felt empowered. (Table  1 : Picture  8).|$|R

50|$|Cherri {{grew up as}} a fan of Flavia Palmiero, {{a famous}} children's show host during Cherri's childhood. She had been taking dancing classes, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> someday <b>she</b> would become a great dancer.|$|R
25|$|Although Emma was {{not brought}} back, Nick <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should have, due to having {{suggested}} that Revolution's product was {{made out of}} cupboard, which was deemed {{one of the biggest}} flaws in its design as a result.|$|E
25|$|She {{participated in}} the Women's Sports Festival held in Santo Domingo taking the {{competitors}} sports oath, her first competition after the London Olympics and she confessed that she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could overcame what happened there. Contreras, that was awarded weightlifting Most Valuable Athlete, lifted 96kg in the 53kg snatch competition to win the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|Frances McDormand as Julie Hastings, a {{district}} attorney and Peyton's love interest. Raimi {{had wanted to}} work with Frances McDormand but the studio resisted this notion and almost cast Julia Roberts before Pretty Woman made her a star. At one point, they wanted Demi Moore for the role. The director even tested Bridget Fonda but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was too young for Neeson.|$|E
60|$|But {{the rest}} of us rather looked with favour on the Story Girl's idea. We <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would do penance as picturesquely and {{thoroughly}} as she did everything else.|$|R
60|$|Already I <b>felt</b> relieved, seeing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> too {{was caught}} in the spell.|$|R
60|$|Now Hilda knew {{perfectly}} well that the aunt of whom I spoke WAS Lady Tepping; so I <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had played this card of malice prepense, to pique Lady Meadowcroft.|$|R
