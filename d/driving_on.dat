5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> the outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson {{on the inside}} line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> the outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away {{from the rest of}} the field.

40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of anger behind the wheel <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> {{behavior}} and accident involvement {{has been the subject}} of many studies. However, few studies have explored the interaction between anger and <b>driving</b> experience <b>on</b> dangerous <b>driving</b> behavior. This study is a moderated mediation analysis of {{the effect of}} trait anger, driving anger, and <b>driving</b> experience <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> behavior. A sample of 303 drivers was tested using the Trait Anger Scale (TAS), the Driving Anger Scale (DAS), and the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI). The results showed that trait anger and driving anger were positively correlated with dangerous driving behavior. Driving anger partially mediated the effect of trait anger <b>on</b> dangerous <b>driving</b> behavior. Driving experience moderated the relationship between trait anger and driving anger. It also moderated the effect of <b>driving</b> anger <b>on</b> dangerous <b>driving</b> behavior. These results suggest that drivers with more driving experience may be safer as they are not easily irritated during driving. </p...|$|R

Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless <b>driving.</b> <b>On</b> November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E
5|$|Despite passing {{closest to}} the Florida Keys, impact was minimal, limited to {{tropical}} storm-force winds and light rainfall. The outerbands of Isaac produced heavy precipitation further north, especially in Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Indian River counties. In the former, the resultant flooding left numerous residents in Royal Palm Beach and Loxahatchee isolated. There was extensive street flooding, and water entered a few houses. Damage in Palm Beach County alone was nearly $71.6million (2012USD). Inland flooding was also reported in several other counties, though losses were generally minor. A tornado in Indian River County damaged 118mobile homes and 15single family homes. Further north in Central Florida and the Panhandle, the storm spawned four other tornadoes. Tides along the Gulf Coast of Florida caused erosion and coastal flooding in Bay, Collier, Franklin, Gulf, and Wakulla counties. Though winds caused little damage, around 113,000customers were left without electricity in South Florida. The storm resulted in two indirect fatalities, both caused by vehicles <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> slick roads in Palm Beach and Okeechobee counties. Throughout the state, damage reached approximately $91.45million.|$|E

She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E

5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. <b>Driving</b> <b>on</b> the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
5|$|The watch members use {{the group}} {{as an excuse to}} drink and have fun, much to Evan's annoyance. While <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> patrol, they accidentally hit something. They {{discover}} a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly destructive weapon and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan apparently kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the aliens are stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and reveals his worry that it may cause her to leave.|$|E

5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi to reduce his speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by oversteer and struggled with <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove hard but experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused him to feel vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd.

5|$|The 2nd Army was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks from 10 April resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the Sava. On 11 April, the Hungarians crossed the border in the sector for which the 2nd Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. On the same day, the German 8th Panzer Division, <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> Belgrade into the flank of the 2nd Army, had effectively routed the entire 2nd Army Group. The disintegration of the 2nd Army as a combat force was accelerated by fifth column activities and desertion by many of its Croat soldiers. The Germans captured Belgrade on 12 April. Remnants of the 2nd Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava on 14 April, and the headquarters of the 2nd Army was rebuffed when it contacted the Germans in an attempt to negotiate a separate ceasefire. On 14–15 April, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers were captured. The Germans closed on Sarajevo, capturing it on 15 April, and accepted the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at 12:00 the following day.|$|E
