5|$|The {{camp was}} {{operated}} by 20–25 German and Austrian {{members of the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände and 80–120 Wachmänner ("watchmen") guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the Trawniki concentration camp near Lublin, Poland; all Wachmänner <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> trained at Trawniki. The <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> mainly ethnic German Volksdeutsche from the east and Ukrainians, with some Russians, Tatars, Moldovans, Latvians, and Central Asians, {{all of whom had}} served in the Red Army. They were enlisted by Karl Streibel, the commander of the Trawniki camp, from the prisoner of war (POW) camps for Soviet soldiers. The degree to which their recruitment was voluntary remains disputed; while conditions in the Soviet POW camps were dreadful, some Soviet POWs collaborated with the Germans even before cold, hunger, and disease began devastating the POW camps in mid-September 1941.|$|E
5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into his hat and then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner.

5|$|Between {{the end of}} September {{and the end of}} December 1941, the Kozara Partisans {{conducted}} around forty {{military operations}} against the enemy. Stojanović helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of Podgradci, Mrakovica, and Turjak. Stojanović argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of Gradiška, and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans. On 23October 1941, Partisans under Stojanović's command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting. The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of railroad ties, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanović saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Ustaše and Croatian Home <b>Guards</b> <b>were</b> captured in Podgradci. The Ustaše were promptly executed, and the Home <b>Guards</b> <b>were</b> given a speech by Stojanović before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the Una River.|$|E

Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|On convict ships, the convicts were {{guarded by}} {{pensioner}} guards, who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service {{in areas such}} as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them. The pensioner <b>guards</b> <b>were</b> expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison.|$|E
