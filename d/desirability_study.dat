40|$|Quality social {{relationships}} depend, in part, on deferring self-interest {{to another person}} or group. Being too arrogant or self-focused could negatively affect relationship quality. In two studies we examined possible connections between trait humility and social relationship quality (SRQ). Participants completed survey measures of each construct. Self and peer-reported humility correlated positively with SRQ, even when social <b>desirability</b> (<b>Study</b> 1) and other relevant personality dimensions (e. g., Big Five, agency, communion) were statistically controlled (Study 2).

40|$|Nine {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{with the goal of}} developing a self-report measure of psychological entitlement and assessing its interpersonal consequences. The Psychological Entitlement Scale (PES) was found to be reliable and valid (Study 1, 2), not associated with social <b>desirability</b> (<b>Study</b> 2), stable across time (Study 3), and correlated negatively with two of the Big Five factors: agreeableness and emotional stability (Study 4).

The use of electronic tools for data collection in health research is, however, increasing {{and there has been}} a shift in electronic data collection tools from proprietary to open-source softwares. OpenXdata is an open-source tool that supports both web and mobile phone based data collection. OpenXdata offers three main blocks of functions: forms design even complex forms, data collection and management. OpenXdata has been used in several health studies, but its user-friendliness has not been studied. This study aims to explore the usability and desirability of OpenXdata for the field data collection in health research. This study followed a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach through a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey and <b>desirability</b> <b>study</b> using Microsoft Product Reaction Cards. A total of 12 participants enrolled in either Master or PhD degree programme at the Centre of International Health, University of Bergen were recruited for this study. In this study, OpenXdata obtained a SUS score of 73. 54 suggesting that OpenXdata can be well accepted in health research.

40|$|People vary in {{the extent}} to which they believe that a {{committed}} relationship is desirable for them. The current research offers and examines the concept of commitment desirability, defined as the subjective desire to be involved in a committed romantic relationship. In six studies, the present research developed and tested a measure of commitment desirability and explored how it influences relationship initiation among those not currently involved in a relationship, and maintenance and dissolution decisions among those who are involved in a relationship. Study 1 and 2 a developed and validated a reliable measure of commitment <b>desirability.</b> <b>Study</b> 2 b examined the concurrent association of commitment desirability with dependence and dissolution consideration among people currently involved in a romance and provided evidence for its predictive validity via measures of breakup assessed approximately 4 months later. Using samples of people not currently involved in a romance, Study 3 provided initial evidence that an antecedent for commitment desirability lies in perceptions of past romantic relationship satisfaction, while Study 4 provided experimental evidence demonstrating that individuals higher in own commitment desirability express greatest romantic interest in targets who themselves are particularly interested in a committed relationship. Study 5 replicated the matching effect of commitment desirability and perceived partner commitment for individuals currently involved in relationships, showing that commitment desirability was associated with greater expectations of relationship stability and certainty, especially when partners were perceived to be high in commitment. Study 6 was an experiment exploring relationship maintenance behaviors concerning partner goal support for people currently involved in a romance. Individuals high in commitment desirability were more willing to support their partner’s own individual goals especially if they perceived their partner to be highly committed to the relationship. Taken together, the present research suggests that commitment desirability is a meaningful predictor of relationship attitudes and behaviors. Implications and future directions are discussed. ...|$|E
30|$|Caregivers {{identified}} that physical appearance {{is the main}} feature that facilitates the child’s involvement {{as a victim of}} bullying, followed by shyness and unpopularity. This conception is in accordance with other studies that identify characteristics that favor victimization, including anxiety (Pabian & Vandebosch, 2016), low self-esteem (Tsaousis, 2016), loneliness, lack of close friends (Acquah, Topalli, Wilson, Junttila, & Niemi, 2016), and physical characteristics, such as appearing to be overweight or very skinny (Reulbach et al., 2013). Another factor found in the literature as a trigger of bullying is the presence of mistreatment and domestic violence (Bowes et al., 2009). The caregivers of the sample did not present these factors, not mentioning the influence of the family in the children’s experiences of victimization. This data can be justified by a possible method bias, as a self-report questionnaire was used in this research, whose responses may have been influenced by social <b>desirability.</b> <b>Studies</b> indicate that dissatisfaction with body image is a variable strongly associated with victimization in bullying situations and is associated, albeit to a lesser extent, with aggression (Levandoski & Luiz Cardoso, 2013; Rech, Halpern, Tedesco, & Santos, 2013). In Levandoski and Luiz Cardoso (2013)’s study, it was {{identified that}} both victims and aggressors would like to be physically “bigger,” for example, which {{may be related to the}} growing appreciation of a muscular type, especially during adolescence (Brixval, Rayce, Rasmussen, Holstein, & Due, 2012).

40|$|Psychometrics is {{the field}} of study {{concerned}} with the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement. This includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes and personality traits. Psychometric measurement tools are often used in the User Experience profession to assess user???s perceptions of their interactions with websites, software and hand held devices. Various psychometric questionnaires have been employed for assessing the usability of interactive systems, (e. g., Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS), Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ), etc.) However, {{one of the most}} popular psychometric measurement tools for Human Factors engineers and User Experience professionals is the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS was developed in 1986 by John Brooke as a ???quick and dirty??? usability scale during his tenure at the software company Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It has (arguably) been established that the SUS is a highly effective tool for use when measuring usability and ???user friendliness???. However, when User Experience and Human Factors professionals need to measure more emotional reactions to designs such as perceived trust, comfort, loyalty and appearance what psychometric tool alternatives exist? Recently, a new psychometric questionnaire has been introduced in the field. Labeled the Standard Usability Percentile Rank Questionnaire (i. e., SUPR-Q), this new psychometric tool???s global score is made up of a percentile ranking based on a composite weighting of four factors: Usability, Trust & Credibility, Appearance and Loyalty. In addition, percentile ranks are provided for each factor so the strengths and weakness by factor can be assessed (Sauro, 2010). In November of 2010, the User Experience Research team for Kelley Blue Book, a third party automotive website, used the SUPR-Q as the post-test questionnaire for a <b>Desirability</b> <b>Study.</b> The SUPR-Q was used to assess measures of Trust, Comfort, Loyalty and Appearance of two proposed site redesign concepts. Ultimately, the KBB. com User Experience design and research teams discovered that the new SUPR-Q psychometric questionnaire results did provided valuable insights. Particularly enlightening were percentile rank comparisons across all four sub-categories (Trust, Comfort, Loyalty and Appearance) against other competitive third party auto sites. However, other confounding factors may have rendered the SUPR-Q less effective in providing statistically significant data regarding how the two proposed redesign concepts performed against each other...|$|E

These symptoms include excessive acquisition, difficulty in discarding, and excessive clutter that causes distress. We conducted three studies to examine the factor structure, reliability, {{and validity of the}} Japanese version of the HRS-SR (HRS-SR-J). Methods: Study 1 examined its reliability; 193 college students and 320 adolescents and adults completed the HRS-SR-J and, of the college students, 32 took it again 2  weeks later. Study 2 aimed to confirm that its scores in a sample of 210 adolescents and adults are independent of social <b>desirability.</b> <b>Study</b> 3 aimed to validate the HRS-SR-J in the aspects of convergent and discriminant validity in a sample of 550 adults. Results: The HRS-SR-J showed good internal consistency and 2 -week test–retest reliability. Based on the nonsignificant correlations between the HRS-SR-J and social desirability, the HRS-SR-J was not strongly affected by social desirability. In addition, it also had a good convergent validity with the Japanese version of the Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R-J) and the hoarding subscale of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, while having a significantly weaker correlation with the five subscales of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, except for the hoarding subscale. In addition, the strength of the correlation between the HRS-SR-J and the Japanese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 and that between the HRS-SR-J and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 were significantly weaker than the correlation between the HRS-SR-J and the SI-R-J. These results demonstrate that the HRS-SR-J has good convergent and discriminant validity. Conclusion: The HRS-SR-J is a notable self-report scale for examining the severity of hoarding symptoms.

40|$|In {{three studies}} the {{moderator}} variable approach to agreement was examined. Four potential moderators were considered: behavioral consistency, observability, confirmability, and social <b>desirability.</b> <b>Study</b> 1 explored how the moderators vary by target standing [...] {{the extent to}} which a target possesses a trait [...] for different traits. Using 108 perceivers, the moderators were rated for 400 hypothetical targets depicted for 80 traits and 5 target standings (e. g., extremely honest or not very deceitful). Analyses revealed that the moderators varied as a complex function of target standing and that function varied by trait. These results imply problems in the measurement of moderators in the previous literature. A new method for measuring moderators based on target standing was proposed. Using this new method, Studies 2 and 3 examined the moderators at low and at high acquaintance by both within-trait and between-trait analyses. In Study 2 (80 perceivers and 32 targets) and in Study 3 (160 perceivers and 40 targets), each target was judged by 20 perceivers on 20 trait dimensions. Agreement was measured by dissensus indexed by standard deviation of ratings, and by consensus estimated by target variance in the Social Relations Model (SRM). Study 3 also examined potential differences between hypothetical and real targets in judging the moderators. Analyses revealed that target extremity had a strong effect on agreement and effects of the moderators were generally stronger at high than at low acquaintance. There was evidence that both consistency and social desirability moderate dissensus, regardless of the levels of acquaintance. Observability at the between-trait level had a reliable effect on consensus, but only at low acquaintance. It was also found that dissensus is not the opposite of consensus, but is formed by a combination of the two variances of the SRM, perceiver and relationship. Further analyses revealed that the moderators had stronger effect on the perceiver than on the relationship variance at low acquaintance and vice versa at high acquaintance. There was strong, converging evidence that conventional analyses are inappropriate for tests of the moderators, and that the new method based on hypothetical targets is valid and appropriate. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Big Five model of personality was examined when its dimensions were measured independently at both poles, based on new items designed to reduce the social desirability bias often found between the polarities. Inductive, deductive and criterion-centric methods were employed and an instrument created that measures Big Five traits both adaptively and maladaptively. Based on a comprehensive literature review of the potency of different personality scales in predicting positive and negative performance at work, 410 items were created to measure the desired adaptive and maladaptive scales and a sample of English speaking professionals (N = 1, 686 females, mean age = 44. 0, SD = 12. 0; N = 820 males, mean age = 46. 5, SD = 13. 0) assessed themselves against them on a Likert scale. Eighteen scales were created based on fifty-seven items and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to understand {{the impact of the}} new structure on the Big Five. The convergent and divergent validity were tested using hypotheses regarding the proposed correlations with industry benchmark instruments. A re-validation study (N = 438), test re-test study (N = 117), consensual validity study (N = 105) and social <b>desirability</b> <b>study</b> (N = 26, N = 28, N = 40) were also undertaken. Criterion validity was examined using behavioural competency models (N = 254, N = 73), with 360 observer feedback gathered and a priori hypotheses tested. The results revealed that evaluative bias can be reduced with the proposed approach, and the Big Five factor structure persists, whilst simultaneously enabling test users to explore their adaptive and maladaptive traits {{at both ends of the}} polarities. It is argued that conceptualising maladaptive traits as the more extreme ends of the Big Five (“too much of a good thing”) is helpful from a user validity perspective and avoids the risk of pathologizing people in organisational settings. Finally, the instrument’s eighteen scales have been located in the personality periodic table (Woods and Anderson, 2016) and the concept of a blended Conscientiousness and Neuroticism scale has been supported by the current research and provides a new approach.

40|$|The {{positive}} psychology approach {{involves the}} study of characteristics that may contribute to an optimal functioning of individual and society (e. g. Gable & Haidt, 2005), by improving for instance well-being and prosocial orientation. In this scenario, mindfulness, i. e. a non-judgmental awareness that emerges through {{paying attention to the}} present moment (e. g. Kabat-Zinn, 1994), is particularly relevant. Similarly, a growing interest has been recently devoted to self-compassion, i. e. a non-judgmental attitude towards own weaknesses (Neff, 2003). Mindfulness and self-compassion showed to be related to improved well-being (e. g. Bernard & Curry, 2011; Keng, Smoski, & Robins, 2011). Their relation to prosocial tendencies (e. g. Block-Lerner, Orsillo, & Plumb, 2004, Neff & Germer, 2013) is less clear though. Aiming to better understand the relationship of mindfulness and self-compassion with indicators of well-being and prosocial orientation, two new constructs have been developed in this thesis. The first construct is "emotional awareness", a non-judgmental awareness toward own emotions, positive and negative, which are therefore fully experienced, without alterations or suppressions. The second one, "self-caring", covers (i) the awareness to be in a time of trouble and to need help; and (ii) the openness to accept the offered support. Mindfulness is hypothesized to be a precondition of self-compassion (e. g. Birnie, Speca, & Carlson, 2010), emotional awareness and self-caring. We aimed to investigate the relationship of mindfulness, self-compassion, emotional awareness and self-caring with different indicators of well-being and prosocial tendencies, considering the simultaneous effects of social desirability. More specifically, we tested a mediation model in which the relationship of mindfulness with well-being and prosocial inclinations was mediated by self-compassion, emotional awareness and self-caring. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed an Italian adaptation of the instruments used to asses mindfulness and self-compassion, i. e., the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003; Study 1), and the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF; Raes, Pommier, Neff & Van Gucht, 2011; Study 2). Furthermore, we developed the two instruments for the assessment of emotional awareness and self-caring dispositions and we investigated their main psychometric characteristics (Study 3). Then, through a confirmatory factor analysis, we showed that the analyzed constructs were different from each other, although partially overlapping, controlling also for their susceptibility to social <b>desirability</b> (<b>Study</b> 4). The subsequent study has preliminarily investigated the relationship of mindfulness, self-compassion, emotional awareness and self-caring with indicators of well-being and prosocial orientation (Study 5). The mediation model has been therefore tested for the first time. Finally, the last two studies examined more in depth the mediation model. Specifically, we employed indicators of general, subjective and psychological well-being (Study 6), unconditional respect and prosocial personality (Study 7). In these studies we also tested a two-level mediation model, where the relationship of mindfulness with well-being and prosocial tendencies was mediated by self-compassion, emotional awareness and self-caring, at the first level, and by gratitude and inter-being, at the second level. Gratitude has already showed to be related to an increase in well-being and prosocial inclinations, while inter-being is a new construct of Eastern origin. In all these studies, the mediation model has been examined adopting a structural equation model approach. Overall, the results suggest that mindfulness is associated with improved well-being and increased prosocial orientation, especially through higher emotional awareness, gratitude and inter-being. Strengths, limitations, implications of the studies and future perspectives are discussed. ...|$|E

The two scales were statistically significantly related in all groups and for both versions of the inventory. A two-factor congeneric, orthogonal measurement model was rejected for all groups. However, a two-factor model that allowed cross-loadings among the items and correlation between the factors provided adequate fit. Concurrent validity data showed scores on both the Impression Management and Self-Deceptive Enhance-ment (SDE) scales to be satisfactory measures of their respective constructs and also of general social desirability, for both forensic clients and undergraduates. An exception was found in lower validity correlates for scores on the SDE scale in the PDS form...|$|R
40|$|Births {{postponement}} {{is a key}} {{demographic trend}} of the last decades. To examine its social <b>desirability,</b> we <b>study</b> how utilitarian criteria rank histories equal on all dimensions except {{the age at which}} individuals give birth to their children. We develop a T-period dynamic overlapping generations economy with a fixed living space, where individual welfare is increasing in the available space per head, and where agents have children in one out of two fertility periods. When comparing finite histories with an equal total number of life-periods, classical, average and critical-level utilitarian criteria select the same fertility timing, i. e. the one leading to the most smoothed population path. When comparing infinite histories with stationary population sizes, utilitarian criteria may select different birth timings, depending on individual utility functions. Those results are compared with the ones obtained when agents value coexistence time with their descendants. Finally, we identify conditions under which a shift from an early births regime to a late birthsregime is socially desirable...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{world events}} {{have led to}} an {{increased}} awareness of religious differences. Past {{research has shown that}} Christians who are extrinsically religious exhibit greater levels of racial prejudice than those that are intrinsically religious. The present study asked 180 undergraduate students (138 women) to read one of six scenarios which varied the scenario character 2 ̆ 7 s religion (Buddhist, Christian, Muslim) with level of religiosity (intrinsic, extrinsic). Participants then answered questions about the scenario charicter 2 ̆ 7 s prejudice toward other religions. In addition, participants completed personality measures of social desirability, religiosity, and prejudice toward other religons. Participants perceived intrinsically religious scenario characters to be more prejudiced toward other religions than extrinsically religious scenario charactcrs. A low positive corelation was found between perceived prejudice of the scenario character and personal prejudice for participants who were low in social <b>desirability.</b> The <b>study</b> did not find that participants perceived a difference in prejudice levels of the three religions...|$|R
40|$|Respondents {{typically}} underreport socially undesirable {{behaviors and}} overreport socially desirable behaviors {{because of a}} social desirability bias. This not only leads to biased data, but also {{has important implications for}} health-care marketers interested in encouraging people to perform in more socially desirable ways. This article investigates the effects of providing counterbiasing information on reducing this social <b>desirability</b> bias. <b>Study</b> 1 investigates whether information that a socially desirable behavior is performed less frequently than expected reduces the extent of overreporting. In Study 2, alternative methods of presenting information about the target behavior are studied. The data demonstrate that counterbiasing information is more effective when the referent is a population base rate versus an individual, and is moderated by the wording of the frequency, such that the counterbiasing information is more effective when the frequency is worded as an actual number versus a percent. Implications for questionnaire design and health-care marketing are discussed. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how a person’s willingness to exert effort affects how others perceive their romantic <b>desirability.</b> The <b>study</b> also examines whether the participants’ implicit theory of personality (incremental or entity) influences {{ratings of the}} target’s romantic desirability based on the target’s level of effort. Seventy-eight (17 males, 61 females) single college students participated in the study. Participants read one of four descriptions of a target. The descriptions manipulated both the target’s ability (hard work or natural ability) and success (successful or unsuccessful). Participants also completed a measure to assess their implicit theory of personality. Participants then rated the target’s desirability. There {{was a significant difference}} in desirability ratings of the target for the main effect of ability. There were no other significant differences found between the variables. The findings suggest that when a person expends effort, they are more romantically desirable regardless of how successful they are. Findings also suggest that a person’s implicit theory of personality does not interact with the target’s effort to affect romantic desirability...|$|R
40|$|The Social Desirability Scale by Crowne and Marlowe (1960), M-C SDS, {{continues}} to enjoy great popularity, {{as does the}} German version by Lück and Timaeus (1969). After 40 years, however, it is questionable whether the M-C SDS is still up-to-date. It {{may well be that}} one could find new items with a higher degree of social <b>desirability.</b> Four <b>studies</b> are described in which a new scale {{in the style of the}} Marlowe-Crowne scale, the Social Desirability Scale- 17 (SDS- 17), was developed and examined. The SDS- 17, a 17 -item scale, displayed satisfactory reliability and convergent validity: Internal consistency ranged from. 72 to. 75; test-retest stability across four weeks was. 82; and the correlations with the M-C SDS ranged from. 67 to. 74. Overall, the SDS- 17 is comparable to the M-C SDS. However, it is shorter (17 instead of 23 items) and demonstrates greater face-validity: A sample of 49 judges rated the items of both scales with respect to social desirability. The SDS- 17 items received significantly and substantially higher ratings than the M-C SDS items...|$|R
5000|$|When Mariner 9 {{arrived at}} Mars on November 14, 1971, {{planetary}} scientists {{were surprised to}} find the atmosphere was thick with [...] "a planet-wide robe of dust, the largest storm ever observed." [...] The surface was totally obscured. Mariner 9's computer was thus reprogrammed from Earth to delay imaging of the surface {{for a couple of}} months until the dust settled. The main surface imaging did not get underway until mid-January 1972. However, surface-obscured images did contribute to the collection of Mars science, including understanding of the existence of several huge high-altitude volcanoes of the Tharsis Bulge that gradually became visible as the dust storm abated. This unexpected situation made a strong case for the <b>desirability</b> of <b>studying</b> a planet from orbit rather than merely flying past. It also highlighted the importance of flexible mission software. The Soviet Union's Mars 2 and Mars 3 probes, which arrived during the same dust storm, were unable to adapt to the unexpected conditions, which severely limited the amount of data that they were able to collect.|$|R

However, an optimum speed of marching has been found, depending on the terrain condition. A different line of approach, involving a study of the relationship between stride-length, frequency of stepping and speed in normal walking and the effect of muscular fatigue on this relationship has also yielded similar results. <b>Desirability</b> of further <b>studies</b> on the effect of load on optimum speed of marching, effective reduction of weight of equipment and optimum distribution of load on the body has been stressed. </span...|$|R
