40|$|Abstract Background In {{many parts}} of Africa as in Benin, the main {{strategies}} of vector control {{are based on the}} scaling-up of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The need to understand the biological implications of IRS in large scale and full coverage of LLITNs is paramount. It is in this context that the present study was conducted. It aims to evaluate the effect of a large scale IRS using a non-pyrethroid insecticide and full coverage of deltamethrin treated nets on the behavior of An. gambiae s. l. in the intervention areas compared to untreated areas used as controls. Methods Mosquitoes were collected using human landing catches, pyrethrum spray catches and window exit traps to assess reduction of entry rate, <b>endophily</b> rate, endophagy rate and overall mortality rate in natural populations of An. gambiae s. l. before IRS and LLITNs intervention (2007) and after in 2008 and 2010. Results In the IRS arm, <b>endophily</b> rate was 67. 13 % before intervention and 4. 5 % after intervention, whereas in the control arm it was stable at 51. 67 % (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). In the LLITN arm <b>endophily</b> rates also decreased after intervention. After the IRS, no gravid mosquitoes were collected from all treated localities, but LLITN performance was not that spectacular. The proportion of mosquitoes biting indoors in the IRS arm decreased from 67. 09 % before intervention to 42. 85 % after intervention, compared to a low but significant decrease (71. 31 % to 57. 46 %) in the LLITN arm. The use of vector control tools and behavior of the host would be the main factors that modify the behavior of taking a human blood meal observed on An. gambiae s. l. inside human dwellings. Conclusion The impact on the behavior of An. gambiae s. l. observed with the bendiocarb used in IRS was highly effective compared with the free distribution of LLITNs in terms of mortality and the decrease of proportions of indoor feeding. Despite this efficacy, {{there is a need for}} complementary tools and research of alternative strategy oriented on effective health education, and the use of powerful tools such as IRS, LLITNs, larviciding and repellents. </p...|$|E
40|$|The filthy {{breeding}} habits, feeding mechanisms, and indiscriminate travel between filth {{and food}} make some groups of synanthropic insects such as nonbiting flies and cockroaches efficient vectors of human enteric protozoan parasites.

40|$|Zambia during March 2007. To {{determine}} whether {{this shift in}} resting behavior {{was accompanied by a}} change in feeding preference, an attempt was made to calculate the human blood index. However, only 46. 2 % of blood meals were successfully identified with existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics. This failure was hypothesized to be caused by the limitations of existing methods that are not capable of identifying host source from anophelines resting for extended time periods. Using an assay we developed that allows for the identification of mammalian host DNA out to 60 hours post-feeding, we were able to successfully determine the host source of 94. 3 % of recovered blood meals. The data show that, although An. arabiensis in Macha experienced a period of higher <b>endophily,</b> the degree of anthropophily and the sporozoite rate in the population remained comparable to the previous malaria season...|$|E

In 2010, 216 million malaria cases were registered, 81 % of them in Africa [1]. Approximately half of the world’s population lives in areas with some risk of malaria trans-mission, and in America this number is 137 million people [1, 2]. Differences in transmission intensity, the presence of several competent mosquito vector species, multiple parasite species, human migration and anthropo-genic environmental changes, are some of the factors that contribute to wide variation in malaria [2]. In addition, the presence of a suitable vector with characteristics such as <b>endophily,</b> anthropophily, endophagy, longevity, high titer of sporozoites and high effective local vector population size are essential for transmission to occur [3].

Moreover, inversion polymorphisms have been. analyzed in An. melas and their possible relationships with behavioural varíations in <b>endophily</b> and anthropophily have been considered. An. melas shows a remarkably short dispersal from typical larval breeding places associated with mangrove swamps ald it is definilely more zoophilic and exophilic than An. gambiae. Only a very small fraction oÎ An. melas biting outdoor on animals rests indoors and consequently the human blood index is largely overestimated if based on the examination of house samples alone.

40|$|Background: Different {{epidemiological}} studies previously indicated that canine leishmaniasis {{is present in}} the region of Thiès (Senegal). However, the risks to human health, the transmission cycle and particularly the implicated vectors are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: To improve our knowledge on the population of phlebotomine sand flies and the potential vectors of canine leishmaniasis, sand flies were collected using sticky traps, light traps and indoor spraying method using pyrethroid insecticides in 16 villages of the rural community of Mont Rolland (Thiès region) between March and July 2005. The 3788 phlebotomine sand flies we collected (2044 males, 1744 females) were distributed among 9 species of which 2 belonged to the genus Phlebotomus: P. duboscqi (vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Senegal) and P. rodhaini. The other species belonged to the genus Sergentomyia: S. adleri, S. clydei, S. antennata, S. buxtoni, S. dubia, S. schwetzi and S. magna. The number of individuals and the species composition differed according to the type of trap, suggesting variable, speciesrelated degrees of <b>endophily</b> or exophily. The two species of the genus Phlebotomus were markedly under-represented in comparison to the species of the genus Sergentomyia. This study also shows a heterogeneous spatial distribution within the rural community that could be explained by the different ecosystems and particularly the soil characteristics of this community. Finally, the presence of the S. dubia species appeared to be significantly associated with canine leishmaniasi...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{comprehensive}} review of the literature on the vectorial importance of the major Anopheles malaria vectors in Colombia. We provide basic information on the geographical distribution, altitudinal range, immature habitats, adult behaviour, feeding preferences and anthropophily, <b>endophily</b> and infectivity rates. We additionally review information on the life cycle, longevity and population fluctuation of Colombian Anopheles species. Emphasis was placed on the primary vectors that have been epidemiologically incriminated in malaria transmission: Anopheles darlingi, Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles nuneztovari. The role of a selection of local, regional or secondary vectors (e. g., Anopheles pseudopunctipennis and Anopheles neivai) is also discussed. We highlight the importance of combining biological, morphological and molecular data for the correct taxonomical determination of a given species, particularly for members of the species complexes. We likewise emphasise the importance of studying the bionomics of primary and secondary vectors along with an examination of the local conditions affecting the transmission of malaria. The presence and spread of the major vectors and the emergence of secondary species capable of transmitting human Plasmodia are of great interest. When selecting control measures, the anopheline diversity in the region must be considered. Variation in macroclimate conditions over a species' geographical range must be well understood and targeted to plan effective control measures based on the population dynamics of the local Anopheles species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of the mosquito and parasite life-history traits that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity are temperature sensitive. In most cases, the process-based models used to estimate malaria risk and inform control and prevention strategies utilize measures of mean outdoor temperature. Evidence suggests, however, that certain malaria vectors can spend large parts of their adult life resting indoors. Presentation of hypothesis If significant proportions of mosquitoes are resting indoors and indoor conditions differ markedly from ambient conditions, simple use of outdoor temperatures will not provide reliable estimates of malaria transmission intensity. To date, few studies have quantified the differential effects of indoor vs outdoor temperatures explicitly, reflecting a lack of proper understanding of mosquito resting behaviour and associated microclimate. Testing the hypothesis Published records from 8 village sites in East Africa revealed temperatures to be warmer indoors than outdoors and to generally show less daily variation. Exploring {{the effects of these}} temperatures on malaria parasite development rate suggested indoor-resting mosquitoes could transmit malaria between 0. 3 and 22. 5 days earlier than outdoor-resting mosquitoes. These differences translate to increases in transmission risk ranging from 5 to approaching 3, 000 %, relative to predictions based on outdoor temperatures. The pattern appears robust for low- and highland areas, with differences increasing with altitude. Implications of the hypothesis Differences in indoor vs outdoor environments lead to large differences in the limits and the intensity of malaria transmission. This finding highlights a need to better understand mosquito resting behaviour and the associated microclimate, and to broaden assessments of transmission ecology and risk to consider the potentially important role of <b>endophily.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Burkina Faso, two {{chromosomal}} {{forms of}} the malaria vector Anopheles funestus, Folonzo and Kiribina, are distinguished by contrasting frequencies of shared polymorphic chromosomal inversions. Sympatric and synchronous populations of Folonzo and Kiribina mate assortatively, as indicated by a significant deficit of heterokaryotypes, and genetic associations among inversions on independently segregating chromosome arms. The present study aimed to assess, by intensive longitudinal sampling, whether sympatric Folonzo and Kiribina populations are characterized by behavioural differences in key malaria vectorial parameters. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} two adjacent villages near Ouagadougou, in the dry savanna of central Burkina Faso. Mosquito adult resting behaviour of both forms was compared based on parallel indoor/outdoor collections across six breeding seasons; 8, 235 fully karyotyped samples of half-gravid females were analysed in total. Additionally, indoor/outdoor human biting behaviour, host selection, and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate was assessed and compared between chromosomal forms. Results: The Kiribina form was numerically predominant in the area. However, the Folonzo form was significantly over-represented in indoor resting collections and showed stronger post-prandial <b>endophily,</b> while Kiribina predominated outdoors. Neither form was statistically distinguishable in human biting behaviour, and both were more likely to seek (> 89 % and > 8 %, respectively). Conclusions: Both Kiribina and Folonzo chromosomal forms are formidable malaria vectors in Burkina Faso. However, the significantly greater tendency for the Kiribina form to rest outdoors despite its pronounced anthropophily suggests that uniform exposure of the overall An. funestus population to indoor-based vector control tools cannot be expected; Kiribina is more likely to evade indoor interventions and escape unharmed outdoors, reducing the efficacy of malaria control. Accordingly, more efficient methods to detect Kiribina and Folonzo, and a more complete understanding of their distribution and behaviour in Africa are advocated...|$|E
40|$|After {{bluetongue}} (BT) {{appeared in}} northern Europe in August 2006 entomological studies were implemented in all five affected Member States (MSs) to establish which species of Culicoides had acted as vectors. The findings can be summarised as follows: (i) C. imicola the principal southern European/African vector of BTV has not penetrated into northern Europe, (ii) three pools of C. obsoletus/C. scoticus {{and one of}} C. dewulfi assayed RT-PCR-positive to BTV- 8, (iii) in support of these results {{it was found that}} both potential vectors had also high parity rates (approximately 40 %) indicating increased longevity favouring BTV virogenesis and transmission, (iv) furthermore, C. obsoletus/C. scoticus and C. dewulfi occurred also widely and abundantly on sheep and cattle holdings across the entire affected region, (v) and during {{the latter part of the}} season showed strong <b>endophily</b> readily entering livestock buildings in significant numbers to bite the animals inside (endophagy), (vi) which demonstrates that housing at best offers only limited protection to livestock from Culicoides attacks, (vii) in contrast the potential vector C. pulicaris sensu stricto was restricted geographically, was captured rarely, had a low parity rate (10 %) and was exophilic indicating it played no role in the outbreak of BT, (viii) the incrimination of C. dewulfi as a novel vector is significant because it breeds in cattle and horse dung this close association raising its vectorial potential, but (ix) problems with its taxonomy (and that of the Obsoletus and Pulicaris species complexes) illustrates the need for morphological and molecular techniques to become more fully integrated to ensure progress in the accurate identification of vector Culicoides, (x) midge densities (as adjudged by light traps) were generally low indicating northern European Culicoides to have a high vector potential and/or that significant numbers of midges are going undetected because they are biting (and transmitting BTV) during the day when light traps are not effective, and (xi) the sporadic capture of Culicoides in the winter of 2007 invites re-examination of the current definition of a vector-free period. The re-emergence of BT over a wide front in 2007 raises anew questions as to precisely how the virus overwinters and asks also that we scrutinise our monitoring systems in terms of their sensitivity and early warning capability...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar a população de Aedes aegypti em área de transmissão de dengue sob o ponto de vista de freqüência, distribuição espacial, paridade, desenvolvimento ovariano e conteúdo do intestino médio. MÉTODOS: O estudo foi realizado na cidade de São José do Rio Preto, SP. Foram selecionados dois setores, um com nível socioeconômico baixo e outro com nível médio. As observações foram {{realizadas}} entre 1996 e 1997. Foram feitas capturas no intra e peridomicílios com capturadores elétricos manuais. São dados detalhes das dissecções para estudo do estado fisiológico das fêmeas e da classificação utilizada. RESULTADOS: Capturaram-se 188 machos e 189 fêmeas. Obteve-se um índice de 0, 46 fêmeas por casa. Dos machos e das fêmeas capturados, estavam no intradomicílio, respectivamente, 82, 4 % e 87, 3 %. Encontrou-se maior proporção de fêmeas no setor de nível socioeconômico mais baixo e com maior concentração populacional. Foram analisadas 148 fêmeas, sendo 27, 0 % nulíparas e 10, 1 % oníparas. As demais foram classificadas nas fases III a V de Christophers e Mer (C & M) com 28, 0 % destas contendo sangue de coloração vermelha no intestino médio. Das fêmeas, 87, 9 % já haviam praticado a hematofagia. CONCLUSÕES: A espécie revelou grande tendência à endofilia. A proporção de nulíparas foi superior a de oníparas, apesar da maioria das fêmeas ser classificada nas fases III a V de C & M. Chama atenção o elevado percentual das fêmeas que praticaram a hematofagia e a ocorrência de não concordância gonotrófica. OBJECTIVE: A Aedes aegypti {{population from}} an area of dengue transmission was studied to determine mosquito's frequency, spatial distribution, parity, its ovarian development and midgut contents. METHODS: The study carried out in São José do Rio Preto country, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Low and intermediate socioeconomic level regions were chosen to the study, which was carried out 1996 and 1997. Using a manual electric aspirator, captures were performed {{inside and outside the}} houses. Dissections were conducted to allow classify female mosquitoes according to their physiologic state. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight males and 189 females were captured in both regions. A general index of 0. 46 Ae. aegypti females per house was determined. Of the total sample, 82. 4 % of males and 87. 3 % of females were collected indoors. Greater proportions of females were found in the region of low socioeconomic level, and higher population density. One hundred and forty-eight female mosquitoes were analyzed: 27. 0 % were nulliparous and 10. 1 % parous. The rest were classified as Christophers and Mer's (C & M) phases III to V, 28. 0 % of which had red blood in their midgut. Of the total female population, 87. 9 % had bloodmeals. CONCLUSIONS: The mosquito species revealed a high degree of <b>endophily.</b> There was a higher proportion of nulliparous mosquitoes, although the majority of the females were classified as C & M's phases III to V. These results highlight both the great number of females who had had bloodmeals, and the lack of gonotrophic concordance...|$|E
40|$|Culicoides were {{captured}} at a BTV-infected dairy near Gulpen {{in the province}} of Limburg (south-cast Netherlands) between 14 September and 4 October 2006. Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were used to sample Culicoides both inside and outside a partially open shed housing 11 cattle. A total of 28 light trap collections were made at the shed and yielded: 9371 Culicoides representing 11 species; > 90 % comprised five potential vectors of BTV and in order of abundance were Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus (of the Obsoletus Complex), Culicoides dewulfi, Culicoides pulicaris and Culicoides chiopterus, Culicoides imicola, the principal Mediterranean (and African) vector of BTV was absent. 2339 Culicoides representing seven species {{were captured}} inside (<b>endophily)</b> the cattle shed: > 95 % comprised the Obsoletus Complex and C. dewulfi. Conversely, the Pulicaris Complex, represented by five species and including C. pulicaris, showed strong exophily with > 97 % captured outside the shed. 7032 Culicoides were captured outside the shed, approximately threefold more than inside. This trend was reversed on an overcast day, when eightfold more Culicoides were captured inside: this indicates that when the light intensity outdoors is low Culicoides will attack (i) earlier in the day while cattle are still at pasture, and (ii) might follow cattle into the sheds in the late afternoon leading to elevated numbers of biting midges being trapped inside the shed during the subsequent hours of darkness. Culicoides were captured inside the shed on all 14 sampling nights. On occasion up to 33 % were freshly blood fed indicating they had avidly attacked the cattle inside (endophagy); because half the cattle had seroconverted to BTV, and because no cattle were left outdoors at night, the data indicate that (i) the housing of animals in partially open buildings does not interrupt the transmission of BTV, and/or (ii) BTV is being transmitted while cattle are grazing outdoors during the day. The capture of partially engorged midges inside the shed shows they are being disturbed while feeding; this may lead to cattle being attacked repeatedly, and if these attacks include older parous BTV-infected Culicoides, may enhance virus dissemination (particularly in sheds where cattle stand close together). Endo- and exophagy by potential vector Culicoides - coupled to increased adult longevity and multiple feeding events in single (potentially) infected midges - would ensure an R- 0 of > 1, resulting in the continued maintenance and spread of BTV within local vertebrate populations. Four light trap collections made additionally in a mature deciduous forest 70 m from the shed yielded a high proportion (48 %) of gravid females amongst which 10 % had incompletely digested blackened blood meals in their abdomens; the absence of this age category in Culicoides captured at the sheds indicates that all Culicoides, after engorgement, exit the buildings to undergo oogenesis elsewhere. In Europe, the blacklight trap is used widely for the nocturnal monitoring of Culicoides; a drawback to this approach is that this trap cannot be used to sample midges that are active during the day. Because diurnal biting in vector Culicoides may constitute a significant and underestimated component of BTV transmission a novel capture methodology will be required in future and is discussed briefly.
