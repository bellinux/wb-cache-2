5|$|Although one of {{the more}} fantastic {{elements}} of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> many of the greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident, in locations no more glamorous than Aaron's garage.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} Marcinkus's {{letters to}} the Lithuanian envoy, Bronius Balutis, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> he shot down his first German bomber, a Dornier Do 17 in March. Marcinkus also wrote that he was {{gathering}} skills and knowledge {{in order to make}} a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence.|$|E
5|$|Teeuw {{writes that}} the {{literary}} style is didactic, which he considers the novel's main shortcoming. However, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> Mihardja {{was part of a}} literary movement led by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana that viewed literature as being instructive; he also writes that such a style was common in Indonesian literature at the time.|$|E

50|$|Zürcher {{previously}} {{pleaded for}} accession of Turkey to the European Union, in 2012, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the perspective of}} accession was lost politically in both Turkey and the European Union. In 2016, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> his previously expected advancement in democratic standards and Rechtsstaat did not materialize, and that Turkey therefore cannot and should not {{become a member of}} the European Union.|$|R
5|$|Thompson {{argues for}} the need to study cells with {{physical}} methods, as morphology alone had little explanatory value. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> in mitosis the dividing cells look like iron filings between the poles of a magnet, in other words like a force field.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the skeletal structures of diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifera and sponges, {{many of which}} contain hard spicules with geometric shapes. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> these structures form outside living cells, so that physical forces must be involved.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda was {{released}} in 1930; Effendi stated that it {{was released}} before Tan's Nancy Bikin Pembalesan (Nancy Takes Revenge), a sequel to Njai Dasima, began screening in May 1930. Dutch newspapers indicate that it had screened in Medan, North Sumatra, by 1932. Biran writes that the film received little coverage; <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> Sinematek Indonesia has no news clippings related to Si Ronda.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{performed}} {{qualitative research}} among the BNP by interviewing various members, Goodwin <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{few of those}} he interviewed [...] "conformed to the popular stereotypes of them being irrational and uninformed crude racists". <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> most strongly identified with the working class and claimed to have either been former Labour voters or from a Labour-voting family. None of those interviewed claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> members claimed that they joined the party {{as a result of}} a [...] "profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity" [...] in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on [...] "British culture and society". <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose sharia law on its population.|$|R
5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> {{some have}} a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{ends the}} essay with an {{analysis}} of lines 210-228 of Beowulf, providing the original text, marked up with stresses and his metrical patterns for each half-line, {{as well as a}} literal translation with poetical words underlined. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> there are three words for boat and for wave, five for men, four for sea: in each case some are poetical, some normal.|$|E
5|$|After Pantjawarna, Fred Young drew Njoo and {{his wife}} to the newly {{established}} Majestic Film. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, Panggilan Darah (Call of Blood). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans {{as they tried to}} eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran to suggest that it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> reviews were mixed.|$|E
5000|$|Will Greenwald {{reviewed}} the UE BOOM for PC Magazine, remarking favorably on its design, volume and stereo pairing function. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> there was {{emphasis on the}} low-midrange tones. Greenwald also <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the UE BOOM [...] "doesn't exactly impress" [...] in terms of low frequency sound. In testing {{the claim that the}} UE BOOM produced [...] "360-degree sound", <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the speaker's imaging did not suffer with different placement or listening position.|$|R

5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

5|$|The {{accounts}} in Mino Khirad, written during the Savafid period, {{demonstrate that the}} Zoroastrians were subjected to harassment by the Shi'ite majority, their places of worship were under a constant threat of being destroyed. By 1707, when Le Bruyn visited Isfahan, the Zoroastrians were no longer able practice their religion freely. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the most deprived Zoroastrians {{had been brought to}} Isfahan, and had been forced to become Muslim three years earlier. In 1821, Ker Porter visiting Isfahan notes that there were hardly any Zoroastrians left in Isfahan and Gabrabad was in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E

[...] and the screen's resolution is low, although readable. <b>He</b> <b>noted,</b> <b>that</b> periodically, FiiO releases software updates for the X3 that improve its various aspects. As such, he mentioned that memory cards up to 128GB are being supported.|$|R
