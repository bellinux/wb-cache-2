25|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> is an {{arrangement}} of braking mechanism which uses brake fluid, typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually {{at or near the}} wheel of the vehicle. In 1918, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> was invented by Malcolm Loughead, which replaced the mechanical brake which was used previously on automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> systems, shoulder belts, side marker lights, and headrests.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} the other de Bange cannons, the 155 L had a hooped steel {{construction}} with gain-twist rifling. In its original (1877) conception, the cannon required a wooden platform from which to fire. Its recoil was absorbed simply by friction with the platform, and the 155 L had to be pushed back into position after every shot. In 1883, the Saint-Chamond <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> was introduced to better absorb recoil. This brake was a separate piece of equipment that anchored the cannon's carriage to the firing platform and returned it into position after about 110cm of recoil.|$|E
5000|$|Air brakes {{are used}} as an {{alternative}} to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> which are used on lighter vehicles such as automobiles. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> use a liquid (hydraulic fluid) to transfer pressure from the brake pedal to the brake shoe to stop the vehicle.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} May 2014 SkyCraft Airplanes {{announced}} that light-sport flight testing on its version had been completed. Their model has a revised cockpit, including Dynon SkyView instrumentation, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system and the [...] Hirth F-23 two-stroke fuel-injected engine. The company's intention was that 12 aircraft would be built for the first production run. However, as of 7 August 2017 the SD-1 was still not on the Federal Aviation Administration's list of accepted light-sport aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim brake. Some brake levers have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contact the brake surface. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> levers move a piston in a fluid reservoir. [...] The mechanical advantage of the lever depends on the brake system design.|$|E

Other miscellaneous applications of n-butanol are as a swelling agent in textiles, as a component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> fluids, cleaning formulations, degreasers, and repellents; and as a component of ore floation agents, [...] and of wood-treating systems.|$|E

25|$|Cars 380-387 were {{originally}} delivered with experimental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. While the cars had these braking systems, {{they could not}} be operated with other R44s. In 1979, seven of the eight cars had these systems removed and replaced with conventional air brakes. Car 385, which never had its experimental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> systems removed, was taken out of service in the 1980s.|$|R

2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a gas starter.|$|E
