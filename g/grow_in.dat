There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> a variety of habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

Most <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E

5|$|Sundews {{generally}} <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> seasonally moist or {{more rarely}} constantly wet habitats with acidic soils {{and high levels}} of sunlight. Common habitats include bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, the tepuis of Venezuela, the wallums of coastal Australia, the fynbos of South Africa, and moist streambanks. Many species <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> association with sphagnum moss, which absorbs much of the soil's nutrient supply and also acidifies the soil, making nutrients less available to plant life. This allows sundews, which do not rely on soil-bound nutrients, to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them.|$|E
