50|$|In the {{mechanical}} example, {{to declare that}} dx is not a geometric displacement because it ignores the dynamic relationship between displacement, force, and energy is not correct. Displacement, as a concept in geometry, {{does not require the}} concepts of energy and force for its definition, and so one might expect that entropy may not require the concepts of energy and temperature for its definition. The situation is not that simple, however. In classical thermodynamics, which is the study of thermodynamics from a purely empirical, or measurement point of view, thermodynamic entropy can only be measured by considering energy and temperature. Clausius' statement dS= δQ/T, or, equivalently, when all other <b>effective</b> <b>displacements</b> are zero, dS=dU/T, {{is the only way to}} actually measure thermodynamic entropy. It is only with the introduction of statistical mechanics, the viewpoint that a thermodynamic system consists of a collection of particles and which explains classical thermodynamics in terms of probability distributions, that the entropy can be considered separately from temperature and energy. This is expressed in Boltzmann's famous entropy formula S=kB ln(W). Here kB is Boltzmann's constant, and W is the number of equally probable microstates which yield a particular thermodynamic state, or macrostate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} flow of an {{incompressible}} viscous fluid through a long tube with compliant walls. The flow is governed by a given time-dependent pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet boundary. The pressure drop {{is assumed to be}} small, thereby introducing creeping flow in the tube. Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluid are used to model the flow, and the equations of a curved, linearly elastic membrane are used to model the wall. Due to the creeping flow and to small displacements, the interface between the fluid and the lateral wall is linearized and supposed to be the initial configuration of the membrane. We study the dynamics of this coupled fluid-structure system in the limit when the ratio between the characteristic width and the characteristic length tends to zero. Using the asymptotic techniques typically used for the study of shells and plates, we obtain a set of Biot-type visco-elastic equations for the effective pressure and the <b>effective</b> <b>displacements.</b> The approximation is rigorously justified through a weak convergence result and through the error estimates for the solution of the effective equations modified by an outlet boundary layer.

This text carried out the displacement experiments to study the influences of <b>effective</b> stress and <b>displacement</b> pressure on the relative permeability. The results indicate that: with the decreasing of displacement pressure, the relative permeability of oil and water and the displacement efficiency become poor; the lower the permeability is, the worse the <b>effective</b> permeability and <b>displacement</b> efficiency are; low permeable reservoirs have strong stress sensitivity, the relationship between permeability and effective stress follows power function; when the reservoir energy drops, the effective stress of rock increases, which causes the physical property worse, and meanwhile the flooding pressure decreases, which ultimately reduce the displacement efficiency, so high energy preserving level is the guarantee of improving the flooding efficiency. The results also indicate that the displacement pressure gradient should consider the actual producing pressure gradient after meeting the requirement of π number, otherwise, the testing displacement efficiency may be larger than the actual. The studying results provide theoretical references for high efficiency development of low permeable oilfields...|$|R

The current work describes the blood flow dynamics and fluid–structure interaction in seven patient-specific models of bifurcating cerebral aneurysms located in the anterior and posterior circulation regions of the circle of Willis.

The arterial wall was assumed to be elastic, isotropic and homogeneous. The flow was assumed to be laminar, non-Newtonian and incompressible.
