25|$|On Sunday afternoons {{when we went}} {{calling on}} the older {{generation}} of relatives, {{those who had been}} active in the Sixties, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Moorcock, [...] "He also, {{when faced}} with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously {{proposed}} and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> {{the side}} of my bed, {{actually}} quivering with excitement.|$|R
60|$|We {{took our}} bags into the Custom House and opened them, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> mine, and {{immediately}} went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> {{the foot}} of the couch near to the font-like basin of water, and She sank down softly on to the other end.|$|R
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of singing Christmas carols {{in return for}} alms or charity began in England {{in the seventeenth century}} after the Restoration. Town musicians or 'waits' were licensed to collect money in the streets in the weeks preceding Christmas, the custom spread throughout the population by {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} up to the present day. Also from the seventeenth century, there was the English custom, predominantly involving women, of taking a wassail bowl to their neighbours to solicit gifts, accompanied by carols. Despite this long history, many Christmas carols date only from the nineteenth century onwards, with the exception of songs such as the Wexford Carol, [...] "God Rest You Merry Gentlemen", [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>on</b> a Sunny Bank", [...] "The Holly and the Ivy," [...] the [...] "Coventry Carol" [...] and [...] "I Saw Three Ships".|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
60|$|The kind frank way {{in which}} this was said quite won my heart, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself <b>on</b> {{the ground}} after {{the fashion of}} a scribe, having no choice, and the Princess <b>sat</b> herself <b>on</b> a couch {{at the end of}} the table, but Seti {{remained}} standing. Then the Princess said: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> a chair, and Mr. Stillwell {{began to}} look over his letters. I {{wondered}} what would happen next, but I was not quite prepared for what did happen.|$|R
2500|$|Fleury {{started the}} 2007–08 season slowly, then won four {{straight}} games before suffering a high-ankle sprain against the Calgary Flames on December 6. [...] He returned {{as a starter}} on March 2, after a brief conditioning stint in the AHL with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. While sidelined, he decided to change the colour of his goaltending equipment from the bright yellow that had become his signature to plain white, to gain an optical advantage over shooters. He was also influenced and challenged by the very strong play of Ty Conklin, who took the team's starting job after being promoted from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in Fleury's absence. Upon his return from injury, Fleury helped the Penguins win the Atlantic Division, going 10–2–1 with a 1.45 GAA {{en route to a}} 12–2 playoff run to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded perhaps the best performance of his career at the time in Game 5 of the Finals at Detroit, where he stopped 55 of 58 shots in a triple overtime win for the Penguins to stave off elimination. Possibly the most memorable save he made came in the second period against Mikael Samuelsson – where he barely got a toe on the puck to keep Pittsburgh in the game, which Petr Sýkora eventually ended. Despite his strong play, the Penguins lost the series in six games, and Fleury's unfortunate attempt to cover an unseen loose puck by sitting on it in Game 6 resulted in him propelling the puck into the net; the own goal {{turned out to be the}} Stanley Cup-winner, credited to Henrik Zetterberg. [...] "The one where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> it?" [...] he said. [...] "Oh yeah. (Expletive) yeah. That stunk." [...] However, he would recover by the start of the following season: [...] Fleury completed the playoffs with three shutouts – a new team record for one playoff season – and a 14–6 record. His [...]933 save percentage was also tops in the playoffs. In the off-season, Fleury signed a seven-year, US$35 million contract with the Penguins, on July 3. It included a no-movement clause, and a limited no-trade clause that triggers in the 2010–11 season.|$|E
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge}} of a feed box, a form darkened the doorway, and Farmer Decker appeared.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge}} of the bed, waiting. In less than ten minutes the {{telephone}} bell rang again. Once more I heard Ashley's voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by her <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} and {{finished}} {{the story of the}} Sicilian lovers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} and dropped into a chair against the light, looking away from me across the wide green space of {{afternoon}} sunshine. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> a little sofa, at a loss also.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> {{the side}} of my bed. The dawn was just {{beginning}} to break up the featureless blackness of the small hours. [...] "This is just some odd corner of my brain," [...] I said....|$|R
6000|$|She {{sat down}} upon a boulder and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a lower slab a yard or so away, {{and we looked}} at one another. [...] "It's still unreal," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "'There {{is but one}} moepuu,' {{said the}} priest Eoppo, looking at me where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the coffin {{in the bottom of}} the canoe. Already the chiefs were {{paddling}} out through the reef.|$|E
60|$|Spears led {{the silent}} players {{out of the}} {{dressing}} room and I followed; and while they began to toss balls to and fro, to limber up cold, dead arms, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bench.|$|E
60|$|A rabbit came {{bounding}} {{across the}} hill {{between us and}} the house. I threw down my suit-case and pursued it hotfoot. After I had run twenty yards and seen it disappear, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the grass and wept disconsolately.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> {{the rocks}} to take, not a sketch,--for who can sketch a {{mountain}} torrent?--but to note {{down on paper}} a kind of diagram, from which afterwards I might reconstruct an image of this feathery, frisky son of Kuhleborn.|$|R
60|$|It was {{of small}} use {{to follow him}} further, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> a {{prostrate}} yellow birch to rest and listen awhile in the vast silence, and to watch anything that might be passing through the cold white woods.|$|R
60|$|At dusk {{that evening}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the back door-step, by the orchard, {{cleaning}} his rifle. The sound of steps {{came from the}} little passage behind me, and a hand was on my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have two--Tuan; {{but it is}} a {{long time}} since <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the ladder of a house to talk at ease with neighbours. Yes. Two households; one in--" [...] Lingard smiled faintly. [...] "Tuan, let me follow you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is only a}} {{step further}} {{to the place where}} we can get a lookout. Just there, beneath the burr-oak. Hours and hours have <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> that spot, with my sewing, while Gershom was gone into the openings." ...|$|E
60|$|His manner {{surprised}} me; {{he did not}} {{now seem}} like the Marcos Marcó I had travelled with that day. Touched with his words, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the stocks facing him, and begged him {{to tell me what}} I could do for him.|$|R
60|$|That was interesting; so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> a rock to watch. Whenever I took my {{eyes from}} him a moment, it was {{difficult}} to find him again, so perfectly did his plumage blend with the white ice upon which he stood motionless.|$|R
60|$|Later, {{when all}} {{had gone to}} bed at the mill, George and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> opposite sides of the fire, smoking, saying little. He was casting up the total of discrepancies, and now and again he ejaculated one of his thoughts.|$|R
60|$|However, I {{did not say}} anything, but {{started the}} packing. It seemed a longer job than I had {{thought it was going}} to be; but I got the bag {{finished}} at last, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> it and strapped it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had them," [...] she calculated, [...] "in the Strand; <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a seat. Well, never mind," [...] she concluded, {{turning back}} into the room abruptly, [...] "I dare say some old {{creature}} is enjoying them by this time." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> {{the stump}} of a tree, and buried {{my face in}} my hands. I must have fallen asleep, for, when I raised my eyes again, the day was brighter. Its cheerlessness had gone. The sky was blue, and birds were singing.|$|E
60|$|He muttered {{through his}} teeth, “Mal. Je ne dors plus.” He moved off {{to stand at}} the window {{with his back to the}} room. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> a sofa that was there and put my feet up, and silence took {{possession}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> {{the sofa}} beside her, {{and told her}} all, without one word of excuse or concealment, from our last parting to the day of Césarine's death in Haiti: and she held my hand and listened all the while with breathless wonderment to my strange story.|$|R
60|$|Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I {{do believe}} they were for me. I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost? He had done his work well. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair.|$|R
