25|$|Cartographers use a {{projection}} {{to project the}} curved {{surface of the earth}} onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of <b>grid</b> <b>north,</b> and magnetic north is about 7° west of <b>grid</b> <b>north.</b> Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ½° in four years. Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map.|$|E

5000|$|At the South Pole, <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> {{conventionally}} points northwards {{along the}} Prime Meridian.

50|$|In {{the polar}} regions, {{directions}} can become complicated, with all geographic north-south lines converging at the poles. The difference between UPS <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> and true north {{can therefore be}} anything up to 180°—in some places, <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> is true south, and vice versa. UPS <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> is arbitrarily defined as being along the prime meridian in the Antarctic and the 180th meridian in the Arctic; thus, east and west on the grids when moving directly away from the pole are along the 90°E and 90°W meridians respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>north</b> is a navigational term {{referring}} to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection. It is contrasted with true north (the direction of the North Pole) and magnetic north (the direction in which a compass needle points).

50|$|The grid {{lines on}} Ordnance Survey maps divide the UK into one-kilometre squares, east of an {{imaginary}} zero {{point in the}} Atlantic Ocean, west of Cornwall. The grid lines point to a <b>Grid</b> <b>North,</b> varying slightly from True North. This variation is smallest along the central meridian (north-south line) of the map, and greatest at the map edges. The difference between <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> and true north is very small and can be ignored for most navigation purposes. The difference exists because the correspondence between a flat map and the round Earth is necessarily imperfect.|$|E

5000|$|In land navigation, {{a bearing}} is ordinarily {{calculated}} in a clockwise direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees. [...] Measured in this way, a bearing {{is referred to}} as an azimuth by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing. [...] If the reference direction is north (either true north, magnetic north, or <b>grid</b> <b>north),</b> the bearing is termed an absolute bearing. In a contemporary land navigation context, true, magnetic, and grid bearings are always measured in this way, with true north, magnetic north, or <b>grid</b> <b>north</b> being 0° in a 360-degree system.|$|E

He would never race for Davis again, and returned to Curb for the Fontana and Phoenix legs as he had for Smith in the 2004 Truck Series season. Twenty-second and twenty-first were the results in those races.|$|R
