5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided to <b>design</b> <b>a</b> passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It {{was intended to}} use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E

In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in <b>design.</b> <b>A</b> report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- There are {{a number}} of factors that need to be {{considered}} when designing high voltage substations. Therefore, <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> high voltage substation is a challenging task. The first step in <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> high voltage substation is to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> earthing and bonding system. An earthing system connection is one to which transformer and generators neutrals or earthing impedances may be connected in order to pass the maximum fault current. In this paper <b>designing</b> <b>an</b> earthing and bonding system for high voltage substation using one and half circuit breaker layout has been briefly explained...|$|R
5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to <b>design</b> <b>a</b> new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project {{to be replaced by}} Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E
5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from Monotype and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at different sizes by modifying Griffo's original single-size <b>design,</b> <b>a</b> quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The changes made were looser spacing, higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} method that enables {{cognitive}} processes to be analysed quantitatively without having a conceptual framework {{in place at the}} start of the research. With current methods, the general structure of the cognitive process in question has to be known before quantitative analyses can be preformed. With the method, we studied the cognitive process of weighting the importance of attributes in a purchasing decision. Our approach consists of seven steps: determining the research method (in our case: the think-aloud method); <b>designing</b> <b>an</b> experiment; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> data collection method; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for preliminary analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for qualitative analysis; <b>designing</b> <b>a</b> tool for quantitative analysis; assessing external validity.
