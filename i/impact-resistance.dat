Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio when {{subjected to a}} uniaxial loading. These materials have recently been gaining popularity within the research community due to their enhanced mechanical properties. High energy-absorption and <b>impact-resistance</b> are of primary interests of applying in automotive systems. In this study, the auxetic foam made of aluminium is used in vehicle bumpers. Initially, the auxetic aluminium foam is fabricated using tri-axial compression followed by heating to softening temperature and cooling down gradually to ambient temperature. The amount of energyabsorption and <b>impact-resistance</b> of the auxetic is then measured. The effect of auxetic fabrication parameters such as heating time, heating temperature and volumetric compression ratio on energy-absorption and <b>impact-resistance</b> have been examined in this research. The optimized auxetic foam could then be adopted into the bumper system. Investigation on the energy absorbing system is carried out experimentally in two different loadings namely uniaxial compression and three-point bending test. Finite element model of the bumper system using commercial nonlinear finite element code is validated by using experimental test on the bumper system. Subsequently, the validated numerical model is employed to investigate and compare the energy absorption performance of conventional foam bumper and auxetic foam bumper. Both the experimental and modeling results indicate that amount of auxeticity directly make contribution to improvement of foam as an energy absorber in automotive industry...|$|E

40|$|Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is a {{relatively}} new and expensive type of concrete for general application. However, in situations of dynamic loading such as blast and impact the material may offer great advantages. The principal criteria are the ability of a specimen to withstand singular or repeated blows and to absorb energy. Generally Ultra High Performance Concrete exhibits excellent performance in overall compressive strength compared with traditional concrete, and when enhanced by fibres has significant ductility and tensile/flexural strength. Concrete material properties are strain rate sensitive and it is necessary to take account of this behaviour when considering dynamic loading.

The hexagon cells generate excellent structures and reduce material waste. Honeycomb structures have very good mechanical properties and are low cost. Nonwoven fabric is widely used in many applications because the manufacturing process for nonwoven fabric is easy and fast. In this study, Polylactic Acid (PLA) nonwoven fabric and Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) honeycomb air cushion (TPU-HAC) materials were combined in a sandwich structure for impact protection. The PLA fibers and low-melting-point PLA fibers were used as raw materials to create PLA nonwoven fabric. The PLA fibers and low-melting-point PLA fibers were mixed at weight ratios of (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %). The mixed fibers were processed using needle punching and thermal bonding to create PLA nonwoven fabric. Additionally, the TPU-HACs were layered to generate various thicknesses (2 / 8 / 10 mm, 4 / 6 / 10 mm, 6 / 4 / 10 mm, 8 / 2 / 10 mm).

40|$|The {{potential}} {{to improve the}} performance of polymer composites cost-effectively has been researched across various aspects of development and manufacture. Each endeavour fell broadly into one of three categories; the principal ingredients and their required properties, the methods {{with which they were}} transformed into products and the means by which they were observed. It was determined that the ingredients with the highest potential as defined, each shared simplicity and abundance as material traits. The use of bespoke functionalised ingredients proved costly to implement, providing only modest property benefits compared to a standard formulation comprising polypropylene, 10 â€“ 30 % w/w of 2 Î¼m calcium carbonate with 0. 5 â€“ 1. 0 % w/w stearic acid surface treatment. It was found that an apparent deterioration in impact resistance that was encountered on reducing the filler particle size was in each case observed, attributable to a coarsening of these fine particles that resulted from the mixing process. Finer particles could not be implemented more cost-effectively than standard formulations; an effect which was attributed to the tendency of the finest particles to form aggregates that could not be decomposed by mixing under high shear. However, the favourability of particle dispersion in standard formulations was used to implement a production method of polymer composites that required significantly less energy across the entire production stage and held other significant advantages. Concentrates comprising minerals in wax were produced and made to successfully re-disperse from loadings approaching those allowed by their theoretical packing maxima, in some cases up to 90 % w/w. Furthermore, a single injection moulding cycle with minimal back-mixing was used to combine concentrates and neat polymers to make commercially-competitive composite specimens, at final concentrations as low as 10 % w/w. A principal method to obtain in situ visual particle data from thin composite films was developed along with several derivative analyses. The techniques allowed rapid and representative data collection for high particle proportions at resolutions of 6 â€“ 8 Î¼m, accounting for particles most relevant to <b>impact-resistance</b> in standard formulations. As a whole, significant and realistic saving opportunities were identified in the expenditure of unnecessary resources, such as; processing energy, capital investment, transportation, labour and time. These findings were supported by experimental data. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Cellular foams {{are highly}} porous {{structures}} with interesting combinations of physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and acoustic properties. They {{are commonly used}} as materials for lightweight space-filler, energy absorption, and thermal managements. A great deal of research and techniques concerning the geometrical design, property characterization and industrial production of cellular foams have been reported. However, {{there is a lack}} of good understanding of the mechanical response and the energy absorption capacity of cellular foams which is vital to foam designs and their industrial applications. Although the mechanical performance of cellular foams under quasi-static and dynamic compression tests have been extensively studied with experiments and computer simulations, few studies of the mechanical properties of cellular foams under indentation and impact loading tests have been reported. However, the indentation and impact properties of cellular foams are essential for foam design of bumpers in vehicle collisions or of protective packaging in impact resistance applications. This thesis proposes a centralized density cellular foam model which is mainly designed for sustaining indentations and impacts. Its indentation and impact properties are studied in detail and compared with homogeneous density cellular models using finite element analysis method. Cellular modelling technique with Voronoi tessellation is adopted to construct numerical models, for exploring the macro mechanical properties of foams ad observation of the inner cell collapse and tearing process. Both quasi-static and dynamic indentation tests are used to measure the mechanical behaviors and energy absorption abilities of centralized density foams. The influences of cell regularity, punch velocity, relative density, punch size and density difference are firstly studied compared with homogeneous density cellular foams with the same relative density. It is concluded that the centralized density cellular are preferable to homogenous density cellular foams in mechanical behaviors and energy absorption abilities under indentation tests. Then, the cell tearing effects in the centralized density cellular foams are estimated under quasi-static indentation tests. Finally, the influence of the strain-sensitivity effects and inertia effects are studied in dynamic indentation tests. Low velocity impact loading tests are also used to exploit the mechanical properties and energy absorption abilities of centralized density cellular foams. Firstly, the effects of relative density, punch velocity, punch size and density difference on mechanical behaviors of the cellular foams are investigated. Furthermore, the centralized density part of centralized density model is optimized using surrogate optimization method based on the highly nonlinear performance of cellular foams under the impact tests. By investigating the indention and impact properties of centralized density cellular foams, this thesis may contributes to offering a design guide for cellular foams used in <b>impact-resistance</b> and energy absorption applications. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
