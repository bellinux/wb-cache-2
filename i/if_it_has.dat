5|$|In Manitoba, a {{city is a}} type {{of urban}} municipality. The Municipal Act {{stipulates}} that an urban municipality can only be named a city <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a minimum population of 7,500 residents.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no public element altogether, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E

5|$|A town can {{be created}} from a village or resort village by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 52 of The Municipalities Act <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a {{population}} of 500 or more. Upon reaching a population of 5,000, a town's council may request the minister to change its status to a city in accordance with section 39 of The Cities Act. Should a town's population decline to less than 500, its council may request its status be reverted to village or resort village status.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a role.|$|E

5|$|In Manitoba, {{an urban}} {{municipality}} may be named a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as an urban municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no minimum population threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can alternately be named a village or urban municipality under the Municipal Act or a city <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a minimum population of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia, it is {{advisable}} {{to take the}} snake which has bitten a person, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been killed, and carry it along {{to the hospital for}} possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes.

For factors that are variable, the table notes <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a direct relationship or an inverse relationship. For example, {{as the amount of}} over-provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players {{with a perfect}} score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the {{organisation}} responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or if numbers have dropped rapidly (by more than 10% in ten years or three generations). None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria, and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern.|$|E

5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is {{of the opinion that}} the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> softened the town's overall image.|$|E
