5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good news {{at the end of the}} 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming that there would be no health risks involved. However, she never <b>gets</b> <b>that</b> chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides to get away from the Ewings and everyone else, including her son, disappear and divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} factors that causes {{complications}} is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally <b>gets</b> <b>that</b> oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. That is why much of the research into the latest soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public <b>gets</b> <b>that,</b> but there are some people out there who like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E

Fischer stated that he was happy that the {{airliner}} attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying [...] "I applaud the act. Look, nobody <b>gets...</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians... for years." [...] He also said [...] "The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States." [...] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., [...] " [...] {{the country will be}} taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders." [...] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{originally}} {{wanted to}} shoot the entire pilot in Miami, but {{during the first two}} weeks of filming, three hurricanes went by: Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Since further filming was to take place during the hurricane season, and it was not possible to get insurance, the crew was forced to move to elsewhere. Though the state of Florida offered a US$450,000 subsidy, the Dexter crew relocated to Los Angeles. Executive producer Sara Colleton explained that the filming crew tried to create a different version of Miami in Los Angeles, that differed from the [...] "glossy look" [...] Miami has in [...] and Miami Vice. [...] "Dexter" [...] was shot in HD; cinematographer Romeo Tirone said he experienced some difficulties because HD [...] "sees everything."

3000|$|If {{the above}} {{algorithm}} does not finish at finite step, {{then it must}} produce an infinite sub-rectangle iteration sequence {X^k}, from the exhaustiveness of division approach, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sub-rectangle sequence {X^k} must converge to a point. From the characteristics of our algorithm, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> {UB_k} and {LB_k} are nonincreasing and nondecreasing sequences, respectively. So that {UB_k-LB_k} is a monotonic non-increasing sequence. By the conclusion of Theorem  1, we <b>get</b> <b>that</b> the sequence {UB_k-LB_k} must be convergent to zero. From the structure of our algorithm, for each k, we have LB_k< v^*< UB_k. Therefore, we can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> [...] _k→∞UB_k= _k→∞LB_k=v^*.

500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill <b>gets.</b> <b>That</b> shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is. For all the ones that think it's all about some ruff shit, talkin' about guns all the time, but no science behind it, we gonna bring it to them like this." [...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big." [...] During the sessions, Nas composed the song [...] "Nas Is Like", which he later recorded as a single for his 1999 album I Am….|$|E
500|$|Three contestants {{are each}} given a card {{to start a}} {{blackjack}} hand from a standard 52-card deck shuffled prior to taping. Ribeiro reads multiple-choice questions and the first contestant to answer correctly earns 100 points. The contestant who answered correctly can freeze their hand, [...] preventing them from receiving additional cards or reveal the next card {{from the top of}} the deck. After revealing the card, the contestant can either accept it for themselves or pass it to one of their opponents who has not yet frozen. If keeping a card, the contestant in control is given another chance to freeze. However, once a contestant has frozen, the remaining contestants must freeze at a score higher than that contestant; ties are not permitted. A contestant is eliminated from the round if their hand exceeds 21. The process is repeated with additional questions and cards until two contestants have frozen or bust. A contestant whose score reaches 21 exactly instantly wins the round and, beginning in season two, a bonus prize which is given to the contestant regardless of the outcome of the game. If two contestants bust, the remaining contestant automatically wins the round. If only one contestant has not yet frozen or busted, no additional questions are asked; the remaining contestant simply continues drawing cards until either beating the highest frozen hand or busting. The winner of this round receives 500 points and a power chip to use in the bonus round, assuming that contestant <b>gets</b> <b>that</b> far. After two rounds, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated. The two remaining contestants play one more round involving the same toss-up question format, but point scores are not kept. The contestant who wins the round receives $1,000 and two additional power chips (originally one), then moves on to the bonus round.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", {{released}} in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording. In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, Room to Breathe, marked her first release of new material in four years. Writing for The Boston Globe, Steve Morse found the album's material {{to have a}} variety of musical stylings, saying the track [...] "Love Revival" [...] sounded like Tanya Tucker and calling [...] "If I Had Any Sense at All" [...] "a mournful country ballad". Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave Room to Breathe a less-received review, reporting that [...] "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" [...] for sounding like a Bluegrass-inspired song such as music by Ricky Skaggs or Patty Loveless. The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No.25 on the Billboard 200, staying at the position for only one week. The second single, [...] "Somebody", also recorded by Mark Wills on his [...] "Loving Every Minute" [...] release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and first since [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall. It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, [...] "Yeah, that had us concerned. The album came out in November and it took 30 weeks for [...] "Somebody" [...] to work its way up the charts. Usually, it's 15 weeks. But this one had a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out. MCA is really kicking butt with it." [...] Its third single, [...] "He <b>Gets</b> <b>That</b> from Me" [...] reached No. 7, followed by the Amy Dalley co-written track [...] "My Sister", which reached No. 16.|$|E

2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me because they know that I go at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw."
