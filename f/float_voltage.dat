In the present work it is demonstrated that, among the advantages offered by its natural origin, cellulose fibers enables superior performance retention under float test at high voltage compared ot PVdF. Specif-ically, {{the performance of}} cellulose-based EDLCs with neat N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (PYR 14 TFSI) electrolyte are investigated upon prolonged <b>float</b> <b>voltage</b> tests at 3. 7 V. After 750 hours, cellulose-based EDLC soffered capacitance retention of 52. 7 % with respect to only 7. 5 % provided by the PVdF-based ones.

Nevertheless, the main aging mechanisms seem to concern the electrodes ’ mechanical and chemical stability. PVdF binder rapidly degrades, thus causing dramatic capacitance losses, especially at the negative electrode.

Reproducible, negative mode ASGDI spectra of saturated headspace perfluoro- 1, 3 -dimethylcyclohexane (PDCH) have been recorded on a home-built quarter-sized cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer (CIT-MS). The fragment ions m/z 169 and m/z 181 were observed. The total abundance {{as a function of}} CIT <b>float</b> <b>voltage</b> was a maximum at 5 volts.

40|$|Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) {{batteries}} {{continue to}} be employed {{in a wide variety}} of applications for telecommunications and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). With the rapidly growing penetration of internet services, the requirements for standby power systems appear to be changing. For example, at last year's INTELEC, high voltage standby power systems up to 300 -vdc were discussed as alternatives to the traditional 48 -volt power plant. At the same time, battery reliability and the sensitivity of VRLAS to charging conditions (e. g., in-rush current, <b>float</b> <b>voltage</b> and temperature), {{continue to be}} argued extensively. Charge regimes which provide off-line charging or intermittent charge to the battery have been proposed. Some of these techniques go against the widely accepted rules of operation for batteries to achieve optimum lifetime.

However, GNB has several years of experience in the installation and operation of large VRLA battery systems that embody many of the power management philosophies being proposed.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} float charge {{operation}} of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries in standby power applications. While the telecommunication standby power {{system is the}} targeted application, the results are applicable in any situation where VRLA batteries are subjected to long periods of float charge. The goals of float charge are identified and a test and analysis procedure is developed to provide a means of assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} applied float charge. The primary goal of float charge is to counteract the natural self-discharge of the battery and indefinitely maintain it in a fully charged state. A secondary goal of float charge is to maximise the life of the battery. This is achieved by ensuring that ageing mechanisms such as positive grid corrosion and gas venting are maintained at minimum levels. The problems associated with conventional float charge control are investigated and, in particular, the electrode imbalance problems associated with some long life VRLA cells are detailed. These electrode imbalance problems can result in the cell suffering a gradual discharge of the negative electrode while the cell appears healthy and on a float charge. This ultimately results in reduced cell capacity and is identified as a major cause of the premature failure of long life VRLA cells. Float charge analysis and the subsequent optimisation relies heavily on knowledge of the polarisation distribution between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell. Conventionally, this is determined {{with the aid of a}} reference electrode, although such testing is only possible in a well-controlled laboratory environment. By modelling the steady state and transient features of both the positive and negative electrodes, a test and analysis procedure is developed to estimate the polarisation distribution within a conventional 2 V VRLA cell, in effect creating a virtual reference electrode. The developed procedure exploits differences in the transient response of each electrode to estimate their polarisations at the applied <b>float</b> <b>voltage.</b> The polarisation estimations are typically accurate to within 10 mV, the window of polarisation relating to minimal positive grid corrosion is approximately 40 mV wide, and the total polarisation applied to a VRLA cell is around 130 mV. The test requires only a very low rate constant current discharge, and cell terminal voltage measurements. This test may be automated and applied to cells in field service, and provides the necessary measure to gauge float charge optimisation. The developed test is able to verify that a cell on float charge is indeed fully charged, and assists in determining the optimal <b>float</b> <b>voltage</b> for maximum cell life...|$|E
