40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} criminalisation of <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel</b> behaviour. Two frameworks are applied for considering the issue: retributive justice and deterrence (so as to minimise the social loss). The conclusion is reached that <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel</b> behaviour has a serious moral dimension and that criminalisation of the offence is justifiable when a retributive approach is taken. It is also concluded that criminalisation {{is likely to be}} optimal from a deterrence perspective; {{this is due to the}} disutility created by stigma and loss of liberty and to the problems with alternatives such as corporate and individual fines, leniency programmes, and rewards to whistleblowers. Arguments against criminalisation relating to judicial processes and incentives on business are found to be unpersuasive. Achieving broad community support is critical, however. An addendum brings the paper up to date with developments in Australia. Criminalisation; cartel behaviour...|$|E

In addition to an investigation of supply-side factors, demand-side factors, and market prices, the paper also derives estimates of the economic effects of the decision. The results indicate that the detection of the cartel may have led to short-term price reductions; however, the persistent collusion-friendly industry structure forecloses larger and durable gains for the customers.

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel</b> {{activity}} represents the core aspect of modern antitrust. Since the late 1990 s, increased recognition of dangers posed by cartelization has led European competition regulators to initiate organizational changes and to modernize procedures and practice to combat cartels. However, has policy toward hard-core cartels softened in a harsher economic environment from late 2008 ? This article provides a comparative {{examination of the}} approach towards cartels by the European Commission and, at the national level, by the German Bundeskartellamt. It argues that, on current evidence, any doubts about how far the heightened anti-cartel drive could be sustained in the economic downturn post 2008 should be put aside. While some adjustments to fines {{have been made to}} take into account inability to pay in exceptional circumstances, no special provisions have been introduced to allow crisis cartels and it appears that the legislation continues to be interpreted strictly by the competition authorities as before...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{detecting}} the cartel agreement, which are closed by the companies to assure their gains. However these agreements are in many countries prohibited. Antitrust institutions guarding the competition on the markets detect and punish cartel agreements and similar efforts of companies to protect the competition. The main goal of this work is the analysis of leniency program's efficiency, {{which is used to}} detect the cartels. I examine the functioning of leniency program in Czech Republic and European Union, number of cases, successes in detecting the <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels</b> and the differences in final fines after the judgments. Finally I summarize my knowledge information and opinions of the leniency program and the problem with cartels in general and I suggest the possible ways of improvement...|$|R

I begin by showing that deterrence of recidivism of overt collusion is the overarching objective of the world’s leading antitrust regimes, and I sketch the theory of optimal deterrence in the context conduct by <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels.</b> Beginning in the late 1980 s, fine-setting standards became more precise and progressively harsher. U. S. Sentencing Guidelines for cartels came based on a corporate defendant’s affected commerce and certain objective culpability factors. Alternatively, large fines could be assessed by a double-damages criterion. Combined with parallel treble damages from private suits that often accompany fines, the substantial increase in total penalties has led some lega...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that not much can be done under the existing atomistic system of antitrust enforcement {{to solve the problem of}} sub-optimal deterrence of international cartels. Low deterrence results from the fact that international cartels are generally prosecuted by only a fraction of the jurisdictions harmed by them and that monetary sanctions in those jurisdictions are generally based on harm to their domestic markets only. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel legal tool which enables countries to adopt and rely upon foreign findings of international <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels,</b> provided that the foreign decisions meet criteria that ensure that such reliance is reasonable and fair. As elaborated, this free movement of judgments holds potential to overcome the main obstacles to efficient deterrence and to significantly increase both domestic as well as global welfare. Its costs can also be largely overcome by designing appropriate solutions. The political implications are also not prohibitive. As shown, jurisdictions already rely on foreign judgments that do not significantly differ from the decisions at hand...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Sentencing Guidelines {{provide for}} special {{treatment}} of <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel</b> activity {{to ensure that}} penalties for antitrust crimes effectively deter and punish criminals. The U. S. Supreme Court’s transformational sentencing cases, however, have returned significant discretion to sentencing judges, including the discretion to vary from the Guidelines on policy grounds. Yet, judicial discretion in sentencing is not unlimited. Judges are required by statute to impose sentences that are “sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to achieve the goals of sentencing, subject to appellate review for reasonableness. This Note analyzes {{whether there is a}} sustainable basis for judicial policy disagreement with the Antitrust Guideline’s use of a proxy to measure economic harm. It proposes that appeals courts apply a sliding scale framework when reviewing policy-based variances, and argues that judicial discretion may, in some instances, promote the goals of white-collar sentencing, including moral condemnation. Finally, this Note concludes that judicial discretion to vary from the Antitrust Guideline’s harm proxy, appropriately cabined by appellate review, would not undermine antitrust sentencing policy...|$|E
40|$|KEY WORDS: leniency, <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel,</b> whistleblowing, {{competition}} The EU/US Leniency {{policy is}} a thesis collecting and classifying huge amount of information and data from several legislations {{in relation to a}} relatively new phenomenon of leniency policy. Its additional value are not only commentaries on the de lege lata (currently existing) legislation, but mainly de lege ferandae presumptions emphasizing the trends which could be anticipated in the leniency policies in the future. Processing world data would not be in my capacities and therefore I decided to work with the most representative legislations - those of the European Union and of the United States, a minor insight is also given in case of Great Britain, Germany and France. The thesis helps the reader get familiar with the basic leniency concepts (terminology, principles, history) and subsequently starts explaining the core of the laws from the substantial as well as procedural point of view. Chapters enabling comparison of European and American law firstly set both legislative frameworks and then provide a comparative chapter at the end dealing with weaknesses and strengths of each program. The historical part deals with the circumstances which led to passing of the legislative predecessors of the current laws but also carefully [...] ...|$|E

Broad statistical measures show no signs of endemically weak domestic competition, though the country’s relatively low productivity among domestic business likely signals some sheltering from international competition. The generally healthy level of competition is partly because competition legislation and its enforcement are of a good standard. Nevertheless, room for improvement is suggested in a number of areas. In particular, it is argued that individuals should be able to initiate legal actions directly, i. e. without having to proceed via the competition authority. And, it is suggested that sanctions against individuals in <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartel</b> cases are introduced. In examining specific sectors, this paper is critical of the pace of progress towards competition in the network industries. The rail network, for instance remains fully state-owned and run. And, problems remain in those industries which have been privatised and opened up to competition. In particular there are instances of continued regulation of consumer prices as well as state ownership or influence on other aspects of supply chains which contributes to a dominance of incumben...|$|E
40|$|The final thesis {{deals with}} cartels and Leniency program, which is {{considered}} an effective tool {{for the detection of}} prohibited horizontal agreements. The aim of the thesis is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} Leniency program in the Czech Republic. At the beginning of the work I focus on cartel in legal and economic terms, then on forms and types of horizontal agreements, the so called <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels,</b> which can apply the Leniency program. The intention of this work is legal, functional and historical analysis of Leniency program from the beginning to the present, emphasizing the changes that lead to greater efficiency in the use of this investigative tool and related problem areas eg. the criminalization of cartels, private enforcement of competition law and settlement procedure. In the end of the thesis I evaluate the Leniency program's effectiveness based on statistical data and especially the presentation of the most important cases in which this institute was applied, demonstrating its irreplaceable role in the detection of horizontal agreements by the Office for the Protection of Competition...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{sanctions}} rarely {{are sufficiently}} high {{to be an}} optimal deterrent against cartels. Sanctions against natural persons can thus complement them. There is no systematic evidence proving the deterrent effects of sanctions on individuals, and/or assessing whether such sanctions can be justified. There is a trend among countries to accept as self-evident that individual sanctions, including imprisonment, can be a useful part of effective anti-cartel enforcement. If a country provides for individual sanctions, a strong argument {{can be made that}} relatively short prison sentences are the most cost effective deterrent. However, there are also reasons why countries may provide for longer prison sentences, most importantly that only longer statutory sentences adequately express a society’s condemnation of <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels.</b> In addition to increasing levels of deterrence, sanctions against individuals can be a powerful incentive for individuals to reveal information about existing cartels and to cooperate in investigations. International law does not recognise the principle of double jeopardy that would prevent authorities in different countries from prosecuting the same person for participation in the same cartel. Nevertheless, where cartels are investigated in a multi-jurisdictional context, jurisdictions may consider arrangements to ensure that only one of them prosecutes an individual. ...|$|R
40|$|This report, {{prepared}} by the Secretariat of the OECD {{was the basis for}} a peer review examination of Chinese Taipei at the OECD’s Global Forum on Competition on 9 February, 2006. Competition law in Chinese Taipei has been an important element of the program of economic reforms that moved the economy from centrally directed emphasis on manufacturing and exports to a market-driven emphasis on services and high technology. The competition law follows mainstream practice about restrictive agreements, monopolies and anticompetitive mergers, with a particularly clear statutory basis for concentrating enforcement attention on horizontal collusion. The rules about market deception and unfair practices connect the competition law to consumer interests. There is a risk, though, that rules based on a cultural tradition of fairness might lead to interventions to correct differences in bargaining power, which could dampen competition rather than promote it. The competition enforcement agency, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), is now a stable, experienced administrative agency. It followed an appropriate sequence in introducing competition policy, emphasising transparency and guidance to encourage compliance before undertaking stronger enforcement measures. General reforms are in process that would clarify the independence of the FTC. To improve enforcement against <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels,</b> a leniency programme should be adopted, and the special treatment for agreements among small businesses should be limited. Some other aspects of the enforcement tool-kit should be revised, such as the cap on fines and the use of market share as a merger notification test. The most visible regulatory reforms to promote competition have been in telecoms, although an independent regulator for that sector is just now being set up. The government retains holdings in privatised firms that could have implications for market competition, so FTC vigilance about the risk of cross-subsidy or other distortion remains warranted. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys {{hundreds}} of published social-science studies of private, <b>hard-core</b> <b>cartels</b> that contain 699 observations of long-run overcharges. The primary {{finding is that}} the median cartel overcharge {{for all types of}} cartels over all time periods is 25 %: 19 % for domestic cartels, 32 % for international cartels, and 31 % for all successful cartels. Thus, international cartels have historically been about 68 % more effective in raising prices than domestic cartels. Cartel overcharges are skewed to the high side, pushing the mean overcharge for all types of cartels over all time periods to 42 %. "Peak" cartel overcharges are typically double those of the long-run averages. These results are generally consistent with the few, more limited, previously published works that survey cartel overcharges. There is no evidence that convicted cartels are markedly less effective than unpunished ones. The results of a second survey of final verdicts in decided U. S. horizontal collusion cases, only three of which were international cartels, show an average median overcharge of 21 % and an average mean overcharge of 30 %. Outside the United States, 62 decisions of competition commissions cited median average overcharges of 25 % and a mean of 47 %. There are three significant policy implications. First, there is a view among some antitrust writers that {{there is little evidence that}} cartels raise prices significantly for a period long enough to justify the height of current U. S. cartel penalties. This survey's results, which are based upon an extraordinarily large amount of data spanning a broad swath of history of all types of private cartels, sharply contradict these views. In fact, the data suggest that U. S. penalties ought to be increased. Mean overcharges are three times as high as the level presumed by the U. S. Sentencing Commission. Surprisingly, bid rigging was no more injurious than other forms of collusion, which suggests that the USSC should amend its Guidelines that currently treat bid rigging more harshly than other forms of collusion. Second, the principal antitrust authorities abroad often base their typical or maximum fines on a 10 % harm presumption. Average fines imposed since 1995 by Canada and the EU on identical cartels have been lower than U. S. government fines, yet overcharges generated by cartels discovered outside the United States are higher than North America-centered cartels. Consequently, anticartel laws and fine-setting practices abroad are in even greater need of strengthening. Third, cartels with multi-continental price effects are the most harmful type. Despite the evident increases in cartel detection rates and the size of monetary fines and penalties in the past decade, a good case can be made that current global anticartel regimes are under-deterring. While the recent worldwide trend towards the intensification of cartel penalties has been desirable, global cartels are more difficult to detect, have less fear from entry of rivals, achieve higher levels of sales and profitability, and systematically receive weaker corporate sanctions than comparable domestic cartels. Antitrust sanctions worldwide should be higher for global cartels than for other types. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
