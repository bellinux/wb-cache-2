5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade</b> of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Natalya {{programs}} {{the satellite}} to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko {{to save the}} satellite, Boris unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (received earlier from Q), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the cradle explodes, and falls, crushing and killing Trevelyan and destroying the base. Amazingly, Boris survives, but is frozen solid <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade</b> of liquid nitrogen. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade {{and a team of}} Marines.|$|E

25|$|The Romans {{were among}} the first civilizations to harness the power of water. They built some of the first watermills outside of Greece for {{grinding}} flour and spread the technology for constructing watermills throughout the Mediterranean region. A famous example occurs at Barbegal in southern France, where no fewer than 16 overshot mills built into the side of a hill were worked by a single aqueduct, the outlet from one feeding the mill below <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tank at {{the head}} of the small road from Pumsaint to Caio was thought to be modern since it still holds water. However, when the level of the water was low in 1970, it yielded large {{quantities}} of Roman pottery which show that it is of Roman origin and built early during their exploitation of the mines. The section shows that it was connected to a smaller tank just below the modern road by a drystone culvert <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade.</b> The lower tank also holds water but is in an advanced state of eutrophication. The collection of fragments included Samian ware and coarse ware from over 100 separate pots, and must have fallen into the reservoir when the mines were in full operation. Analysis of the pottery fragments showed a distribution of ages from the late 1st century AD through to the end of the 4th century. Since the fort and fortlet under the present village of Pumsaint ends in the middle of the 2nd century, it shows that mining continued for a long time after the military evacuation.|$|E

500|$|Here, the [...] are the {{transmission}} parameters, {{also known as}} ABCD-parameters.

500|$|Dynamic assembly. This {{approach}} directly {{controls the}} kinetics of DNA self-assembly, specifying {{all of the}} intermediate steps in the reaction mechanism {{in addition to the}} final product. [...] This is done using starting materials which adopt a hairpin structure; these then assemble into the final conformation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade</b> reaction, in a specific order (see Strand displacement cascades below). [...] This approach has the advantage of proceeding isothermally, at a constant temperature. [...] This is in contrast to the thermodynamic approaches, which require a thermal annealing step where a temperature change is required to trigger the assembly and favor proper formation of the desired structure.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{two-dimensional}} realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then {{graduate students}} at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program (actually {{a suite of}} programs) for airfoil design and analysis.

[...] MSES sees wide use throughout the world.

30|$|In {{addition}} to dampening {{out some of}} the “high frequency” noise in system measurements, some amount of hysteresis should be built into SLA evaluations.

2500|$|These use {{balanced}} {{transmission lines}} to separate individual single stage amplifiers, the outputs {{of which are}} summed by the same transmission line. The transmission line is a balanced type with the input {{at one end and}} on one side only of the balanced transmission line and the output at the opposite end is also {{the opposite side of the}} balanced transmission line. The gain of each stage adds linearly to the output rather than multiplies one on the other as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade</b> configuration. This allows a higher bandwidth to be achieved than could otherwise be realised [...] even with the same gain stage elements.|$|E
2500|$|... 178m2Hf has {{the highest}} {{excitation}} energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure 178m2Hf contains approximately 1330 megajoules of energy, the equivalent in about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of the explosive TNT. The half-life of 178m2Hf is 31 years or 1 Gs (gigasecond, 1,000,000,000 seconds) so that a gram's natural radioactivity is 1.6 TBq (terabecquerels) or roughly 40 Ci (curies). The activity is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cascade</b> of penetrating gamma rays, the most energetic of which is 0.574 MeV. Substantial shielding would be needed for human safety if the sample were to be 1 gram of the pure isomer. However, so far the nuclear isomer exists only at low concentrations (<0.1%), within multi-isotopic hafnium. One gram of this material has about 1.33 megajoules of energy, about {{an order of magnitude}} better than compressed hydrogen.|$|E

50|$|One {{effect of}} the {{cascading}} strings technique is to emulate the acoustic properties of a large hall such as a cathedral, through simulated reverberation.
