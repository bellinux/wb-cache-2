40|$|Abstract. Democracy {{is based}} on <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> but also on {{meaningful}} discussions about matters that are put to the vote or about people who wish to be elected. E-democracy cannot therefore be reduced to e-voting. It should also include Internet-based services that facilitate online interaction between voters, candidates and supporters of various opinions. This paper presents a series of interactive tools {{that can be used}} to support such a virtual dialogue. A matrix is proposed to categorize these tools. Examples of such tools used in Switzerland are given. The most sophisticated tools and websites recently developed for Swiss elections or referendums are described in some detail. Possible future re-search on the impact of these tools is outlined. ...|$|E

The aim of this thesis is in particular to present a comprehensive picture of the topic concerning protection of independent performance of the parliamentary mandate, evaluate the Czech legal regulation in force and, last but not the least, to find an answer to the question to what extent is the Czech legal regulation in force complete and effective as well as present possible alternatives de lege ferenda. Member of parliament must be independent with regard to all aspects of the exercise of his/her mandate. Independency of the member of parliament is necessary precondition for his/her ability to exercise the mandate in such a way, which will enable him/her to face external pressures, not only from the state bodies, but also from other subjects or phenomenons. Instruments protecting independent performance of the mandate also support the possibility of members of parliament to fulfil their role freely and as a result to constitute working parliament. Presented PhD. thesis deals with the topic of parliamentary immunity, particular focus is put on the part presenting protection of <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> and freedom of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{attitudes about}} voting in Kenya, {{this study examines}} Kenyan voters’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> to <b>vote</b> {{according to their own}} will and without pressure. More specifically it seeks {{to determine the extent to}} which these feelings are affected by 1) perception of corruption, 2) levels of trust in the government, 3) fear of political violence and intimidation, and 4) ethnic identity. Rational choice theory and an insideroutsider perspective are applied to examine the issue from a theoretical framework. Previous research conducted in relation to voting behavior and perception of corruption, trust in government, and ethnicity, among other things, are considered. This study uses secondary data collected by the Afrobarometer in 2008, and bivaraite and multivariatea nalysis are employed. Logistic regression models are used to examine the extent to which certain variables explain feelings <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> to <b>vote</b> according to personal preference. The results from the logistic regression analyses show that both trust in government and fear of being subject to political violence and intimidation affect Kenyan voters’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> to <b>vote</b> according to their personal preference. These results support two hypotheses. First, Kenyan voters will feel freer to vote according to their own preference as their levels of trust in the government increase. Second, Kenyan voters’ feelings <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> to <b>vote</b> will be negatively associated with fear of being subject to political violence and intimidation...|$|R
50|$|Oren was {{a radical}} {{supporter}} of the Soviet Union and praised its <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>vote</b> and its democracy. During the Cold War in the fifties, Oren supported the pro-Soviet tendency of Mapam. In November 1951 he represented Mapam as an observer at the World Federation of Trade Unions in East Berlin and was also involved in negotiations regarding compensation for East German victims of the Holocaust. In that conference {{he said that the}} workers of Israel would never go to war against the Soviet Union. On his way from Berlin to Zurich, Oren passed though Prague where he stayed a few days on a mission for the Al Hamishmar paper which he was co-editor of. During this period, Oren was arrested along with his relative Shimon Ornstein and accused of supporting Imperialism and of being a Zionist agent. Authorities in Czechoslovakia did not report his detention and his relatives in Israel did not know where he had disappeared. Only at the end of March 1952 Czechoslovak authorities announced that Oren had been arrested on charges of crimes against state security.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in 2013, {{a ruling}} by the Constitutional Court of Italy {{established}} that the Italian electoral system employed to elect the Parliament breached a number of Constitutional requirements. Notably, the Court observed the following four facts: 1) [...] "such a legislation deprives the elector of any margin of choice of its representatives"; 2) [...] "all of the elected parliamentarians, with no exception, lack {{the support of a}} personal designation by the citizens"; 3) the electoral law has regulations which [...] "exclude any ability {{on the part of the}} elector to have an influence on the election of his/her representatives"; 4) and contains conditions such that [...] "they alter the representative relationship between electors and elected people...they coerce the electors' <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> choice in the election of their representatives to the Parliament...and consequently they are at odds with the democratic principle, by affecting the very <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>vote</b> provided for by art. 48 of the Constitution". This implies that, despite being called - and acting as - a legitimate [...] "parliament", the legislative assembly of Italy was chosen with a vote system by which the right <b>of</b> <b>vote</b> was not exercised according to the Italian fundamental chart of citizen's rights and duties. The issue was a major one, to the extent that the Constitutional Court itself ruled that the Italian Parliament should remain in charge only to reform the electoral system and then should be dissolved.|$|R

The first studies a variety <b>of</b> multicandidate <b>voting</b> systems, including approval, Borda, and cumulative, voting, using a model which takes account of a voter's intensity ot preference for candidates.

A brief introduction to e-democracy is also provided and used in the discussion because of the strong conection between e-voting and edemocracy. E-voting is explained mostly with the help of understanding the Norwegian and Estonian experiences. The aspects of e-voting that is focused on include trust for the system, accessibility and secrecy and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vote.</b> In the results I can show that e-voting has both positive and negative inpacts on Dahl and Patemans theories and why it is controversial. The results also points to the positive inpacts e-democracy might have on both the theories and on democracy altogether...|$|R

50|$|Waiver is different. One {{is dealing}} with waiver when someone {{undertakes}} not to exercise a fundamental right in future. For example, a contractual restraint of trade is an undertaking to waive one’s right, guaranteed by section 22, to occupational freedom {{for a period of}} time. A person may also undertake not to disclose sensitive information, or undertake to vote for a particular political party on election day; he may agree to have his telephone calls recorded and listened to by his or her employer, or to attend religious instruction classes in a private school. These are, respectively, attempts to waive the rights to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression, to <b>vote,</b> to privacy and to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> religion.

40|$|Citizen {{participation}} in community decision-making {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} Plato’s Republic (Plato and Grube, 1992). Plato’s concepts <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech, assembly, <b>voting,</b> and equal representation have evolved through the years to form the basis upon which the United States was established. Some historians support the notion that Americans have always {{wanted to be part of}} decisions affecting their lives. Billington (1974) contends that freedom and the right to make decisions on the early American frontier was the shaping force in grass roots democracy, i. e., people’s right to participate. As many frontier villages grew in population it became increasingly difficult for every citizen to actively participate in all community decisions. To fill the void in the decision making process, people began to delegate their involvement to a representative, which grew into the system of selecting officials by public elections, and the increase of volunteer associations and organizations (de Tocqueville, 1959).
