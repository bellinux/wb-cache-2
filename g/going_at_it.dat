500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope". Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof aided {{in the development of the}} series as a consultant, but had no official credit for the pilot.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E
500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E

6000|$|... "Now I shall {{know what}} they all are saying," [...] cried Betty, trying to hear the {{different}} voices; for {{there were so many}} <b>going</b> <b>at</b> once <b>it</b> was difficult to understand the sweet new language.|$|R
5000|$|On June 11, 2013, Hardy {{spoke to}} reporters during a summer minicamp {{claiming}} his goal for sacks in the 2013 season to be 50. Regarding such a lofty number, {{more than twice}} the current record, Hardy stated, [...] "Why shoot low, right? If I'm <b>going</b> to shoot <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I'm <b>going</b> to shoot <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with a 50 caliber. I'm <b>going</b> to shoot <b>at</b> a little bird with a 50-caliber bullet. That's the goal for this year, 50 sacks, that's where I'm at. That's the goal, 50. You heard it first." ...|$|R
2500|$|Akil {{is married}} to Stanley J. Watson, M.D., Ph.D. Together, the husband-wife-pair co-direct the University of Michigan Medical School's Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and each has played an {{integral}} role in the other's career. The couple has two children, Brendon and Kathleen. Akil describes her approach to parenting her children as <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> [...] "full throttle", keeping her career on track and raising her children simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Eisner's {{most trusted}} {{assistant}} on The Spirit, however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter {{in his own}} right. Eisner later said of their working methods [...] "You should hear me and Jules Feiffer <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending— I {{came up with the}} idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree".|$|E
2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. And they were off and running, <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{for over a decade}} and doing it well enough to convince some if not many fans of both shows that the two comedians really were blood enemies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to get}} <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{some other}} way," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "but you bet your life I'm <b>going</b> to get <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It looks to me as though there's {{something}} funny about that pay-roll." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Bathsheba. [...] "But I must be <b>going</b> <b>at</b> once. <b>It</b> {{was great}} neglect in that man {{to keep me}} waiting here till so late. I should have gone two hours ago, {{if it had not}} been for him. I had no idea of coming in here; but there's nothing so {{refreshing}} as a cup of tea, though I should never have got one if you hadn't helped me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is," [...] {{came from}} the man named Tate, [...] "how are we <b>going</b> to get <b>at</b> <b>it?</b> Do you think you'll {{be able to see}} the documents this man Rover must carry?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Contrasting {{with some}} of the more sexual {{relationships}} of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in [...] "The Body". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in [...] "Who Are You?" [...] where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a circle of light until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping and moaning. Within the Buffy universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some types of action on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: [...] "you've got Spike and Harmony just <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> like rabbits, so it's very hypocritical". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated {{by the rest of the}} Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, [...] "remarkable".|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind Crabtree now," [...] put in Dick. [...] "What {{we want to}} do is to find father. I don't {{know exactly}} how we are <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> but I think I'll have some sort of plan by morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Bradbury and Evans are <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> ding-dong, and are {{wild with}} excitement. All news {{on that subject}} (and on every other) I must defer till I see you. That will be {{immediately}} after I arrive, of course. Most likely on Monday, 2nd December.|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. And after I married him, you see, I fell in love. If I had before, perhaps I wouldn't {{have dared}} only, I don't know--you never know, do you? When there's a straw <b>going,</b> you catch <b>at</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But Tom, he WAS {{so proud}} and joyful, he just COULDN'T hold in, and his tongue just WENT it--she a-chipping in, and {{spitting}} fire all along, {{and both of}} them <b>going</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> once, like a cat convention; and she says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{going away}} for a season on a {{brilliant}} tour to regain tone. You're going to Brighton, or Scarborough, or Prawle Point, to see the ships go by. And you're <b>going</b> <b>at</b> once. Isn't <b>it</b> odd? I'll take care of Binkie, but out you go immediately. Never resist the devil. He holds the bank. Fly from him.

60|$|Darius, having bound his captive, {{stood up}} facing me, {{and from the}} {{expression}} on his face one never would have supposed that he had just come unscratched out of as lively a tussle as I ever took part in. It was as if he had been stowing oysters in the hold of the Avenger, and was stretching his back before <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something mysterious, {{you may be}} sure, young ladies," [...] said grandpapa. [...] "I have hunted rats once {{or twice}} a year now these seventy years or more, and I can't say I am tired yet. And there is Master Fred <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> for the first time in his life, as {{fiercely}} as any of us old veterans, and he has a very good eye for a hit, I can tell you, if it is any satisfaction to you. Ha! hoigh Vixen! hoigh Carey! that's it--there he goes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; that's {{just the}} point. It's so {{fortunate}} they were frank about it. It throws {{a new light}} on it; and if that's the way nice people are <b>going</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> why, we must give up the idea. I'm quite prepared to do so. But I want to see Mrs. Wilmington first." ...|$|R
50|$|But {{there is}} {{something}} else <b>going</b> on <b>at</b> CenBank. <b>Its</b> board of directors {{does not seem to be}} completely in control of the company. Decisions are made, plans are executed without their authorization. Some think there may be an artificial intelligence (AI) program nestled in the heart of the CB's huge mother boards. The actions of the CenBank bear close scrutiny.|$|R
5000|$|Owning {{a station}} or being a {{conductor}} on the Underground Railroad (UGRR) was most certainly illegal behavior, although not considered unethical behavior by many people. In light of this, {{participation in the}} Underground Railroad was very secretive; records were not usually, if ever kept of the comings and <b>goings</b> <b>at</b> stations. <b>It</b> would be an unwise act to record illegal behavior, especially in New York where the Northern Democrats were strong. In fact Cyrus' own brother William Gates was an ardent Copperhead and after an argument with Cyrus over [...] "breaking the law" [...] {{moved out of the}} family house. In light of this it is easier to see why much of the history of this vast network of stations has been passed down through oral history.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the way {{the police}} are <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> They're {{virtually}} informing the criminal that they're hunting for him but don't {{know where to find}} him, and that if he isn't careful they'll get him. So he's going to be careful. It is possible, of course, that the fellow has left traces-- clues that will lead to his discovery and arrest. Still, I'm not banking much on that. Such explosions have been occurring for months, {{in various parts of the}} country, and the offenders have frequently escaped. The government suspects that German spies are responsible, but an indefinite suspicion is often as far as it gets. Evidence is lacking." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is rather}} funny that this matter should come up just now, as I am at present engaged in {{treating}} a severe case {{of middle age}} {{in one of my}} stories - 'The Justice-Clerk.' The case is that of a woman, and I think that I am doing her justice. You will be interested, I believe, to see the difference in our treatments. [...] SECRETA VITAE, comes nearer to the case of my poor Kirstie. Come to think of it, Gosse, I believe the main distinction is that you have a family growing up around you, and I am a childless, rather bitter, very clear-eyed, blighted youth. I have, in fact, lost the path that makes it easy and natural for you to descend the hill. I am <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> straight. And where I have to go down it is a precipice.|$|E
60|$|After opening tamely, the {{light-weight}} bout {{had become}} vigorous {{in the second}} round, and both men had apparently forgotten that their right arms had been given them by Nature {{for the purpose of}} guarding. They were <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in hurricane fashion all over the ring. Sheen was horrified to feel symptoms of a return of that old sensation of panic which had caused him, on that dark day early in the term, to flee Albert and his wicked works. He set his teeth, and fought it down. And after a bad minute he was able to argue himself into a proper frame of mind again. After all, that sort of thing looked much worse than it really was. Half those blows, which seemed as if they must do tremendous damage, were probably hardly felt by their recipient. He told himself that Francis, and even the knife-and-boot boy, hit fully as hard, or harder, and he had never minded them. At the end of the contest he was once more looking forward to his entrance to the ring with proper fortitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{developers}} and financiers made {{trillions of dollars}} through the housing bubble and the imposition of crushing debt on homeowners. And when homeowners could no longer pay them what they demanded, they went to government and got trillions of dollars of bailouts. Every effort of the Obama Administration has been to prop this system up and keep <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>at</b> taxpayer expense. <b>It's</b> time for this game to end. It's time for the laws be written to protect the victims and not the perpetrators.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Daisy's all dressed," [...] said Mrs. Miller {{with that}} accent of the dispassionate, if {{not of the}} philosophic, {{historian}} with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter's career. [...] "She got dressed on purpose before dinner. But she's got {{a friend of hers}} there; that gentleman--the Italian--that she wanted to bring. They've got <b>going</b> <b>at</b> the piano; <b>it</b> seems as if they couldn't leave off. Mr. Giovanelli sings splendidly. But I guess they'll come before very long," [...] concluded Mrs. Miller hopefully.|$|R
6000|$|... (3.) If {{we say we}} must {{postpone}} the question till {{the state of the}} [...] country is more fit for it, I should answer that the least danger [...] is in <b>going</b> forward <b>at</b> once. <b>It</b> is liberty alone which fits men [...] for liberty. This proposition, like every other in politics, has [...] its bounds; but it is far safer than the counter doctrine, wait [...] till they are fit.|$|R
6000|$|Sitting on the creatures, {{or with a}} leg firmly crooked {{over their}} heads, each shearer, even the two boys, had an air of <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in his own way. In their white canvas {{shearing}} suits they worked very steadily, almost in silence, as if drowsed by the [...] "click-clip, click-clip" [...] of the shears. And the sheep, but for an occasional wriggle of legs or head, lay quiet enough, having an inborn sense perhaps of the fitness of things, even when, once in a way, they lost more than wool; glad too, mayhap, {{to be rid of}} their matted vestments. From time to time the little damsel offered each shearer a jug and glass, but no man drank till he had finished his sheep; then he would get up, stretch his cramped muscles, drink deep, and almost instantly sit down again on a fresh beast. And always there was the buzz of flies swarming in the sunlight of the open doorway, the dry rustle of the pollarded lime-trees in the sharp wind outside, the bleating of some released ewe, upset at her own nakedness, the scrape and shuffle of heels and sheep's limbs on the floor, together with the [...] "click-clip, click-clip" [...] of the shears.|$|E
60|$|I {{took a look}} at {{her across}} the floor, and I didn't wonder. She was a {{different}} kid from what she'd been upstairs. I never saw anybody look so happy and pleased with herself. Her eyes were like lamps, and her cheeks all pink, and she was <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> like a champion. I knew what had made a hit with the people. It was the look of her. She made you think of fresh milk and new-laid eggs and birds singing. To see her was like getting away to the country in August. It's funny about {{people who live in the}} city. They chuck out their chests, and talk about little old New York being good enough for them, and there's a street in heaven they call Broadway, and all the rest of it; but it seems to me that what they really live for is that three weeks in the summer when they get away into the country. I knew exactly why they were cheering so hard for Mrs Charlie. She made them think of their holidays which were coming along, when they would go and board at the farm and drink out of the old oaken bucket, and call the cows by their first names.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind," [...] {{he began}} again, lifting one arm from the elbow, {{the palm of}} the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower--"Mind, {{none of us would}} feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their {{administration}} was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men <b>going</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> blind--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to...." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Cold Blooded" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "The breadcrumb approach to revealing the larger story at play makes me far {{less interested in}} where the bigger story is <b>going.</b> <b>At</b> this rate, <b>it</b> will take {{the entire length of}} the series for anything significant to actually happen. The villains in these plots haven't been an immediate threat other than briefly at the midpoint and end of the second season, with Nick's confrontation with his captain and Eric's attempt to kidnap Nick back to Europe." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{always put}} figures in. As an {{illustrator}} you quickly catch {{on to the}} fact that nobody's <b>going</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> if there's no human interest. When you start including figures, you can begin {{to create a sense of}} atmosphere. You can show how people relate to a space and you can explore the realities and practicalities of the place, how people lived, how they adapted to their surroundings, how they slept, how they ate.|$|R
6000|$|... “Unless we {{are going}} to live on ants,” the mate said ruefully as he gave a savage slap at his leg, “it seems to me we are likely to starve, for I have seen nothing {{whatever}} to eat since we entered the wood.
