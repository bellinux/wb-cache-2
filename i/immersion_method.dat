40|$|<b>Immersion</b> {{teaching}} <b>methods</b> {{have shown}} a marked improvement over earlier language teaching approaches, such as the grammar translation audiolingual methods of the 1960 s. The central characteristic of immersion is the teaching of language, content, and culture in combination {{without the use of}} the child’s first language.

Since <b>immersion</b> <b>methods</b> were first used in the 1960 s to teach French to English speaking students in Quebec, they have become increasingly popular. Test scores show that immersion students can learn the same academic content as students in English-Only classrooms along with a second language without losing fluency in English (de Courcy, 2002; Johnson & Swain, 1997; Genesee et al., 1985; Genesee, 1987). Immersion students as they proceed together through the grades also develop a strong sense of camaraderie and often form a “values community ” that reflects the positive aspects of the language and culture that they are learning. Immersion language teachers provide ideally at least half-day (partial) immersion for students in the language they are targeted to learn and often students receive full-day (total) immersion. The less students are likely to be exposed to a new language they are learning outside of school, the more they need to experience it in school.

50|$|The <b>immersion</b> <b>method</b> is {{used for}} the {{processing}} of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to degrease and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese phosphate coating is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) {{is highly}} {{workable}} concrete with high strength and high performance that can flow {{under its own}} weight through restricted sections without segregation and bleeding. SCC is achieved by reducing the volume ratio of aggregate to cementitious materials, increasing the paste volume and using various viscosity enhancing admixtures and superplasticizers. It is observed that the behaviour of the design concrete mix is significantly affected by variation in humidity and temperature both in fresh and hardened state. In this paper effect of three non-water-based curing techniques on mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and shear strength of M 30 grade self-compacting concrete (SCC) is discussed. For compressive strength {{it is observed that}} <b>immersion</b> <b>method</b> for curing gives maximum compressive strength while the lowest compressive strength is for no curing. Polyethylene film curing gives second highest strength at 28 days. Similarly for split tensile strength, flexural strength & shear strength, the maximum strength is also with <b>immersion</b> <b>method</b> of curing. For split tensile strength curing compound gives almost at par with <b>immersion</b> <b>method</b> while no curing has least strength. Polyethylene film curing gives good results for flexural strength. For shear strength Polyethylene film gives about 82 % of immersion strength.
