50|$|Quarter sawing {{gets its}} name {{from the fact that the}} log is <b>first</b> <b>quartered</b> lengthwise, {{resulting}} in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with straight striped grain lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive ray and fleck figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is <b>first</b> <b>quartered,</b> which is more wasteful.|$|R
