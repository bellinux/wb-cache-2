5000|$|A {{protein is}} {{predicted}} to be [...] "druggable" [...] {{if it is a}} member of a protein family for which other members of the family are known to be targeted by drugs (i.e., [...] "guilt" [...] by association). While this is a useful approximation of druggability, this definition has limitations for two main reasons: (1) it highlights only historically successful proteins, ignoring the possibility of a perfectly <b>druggable,</b> but yet undrugged protein family; and (2) assumes that all protein family members are equally <b>druggable.</b>|$|E

50|$|If a drug {{has already}} been {{identified}} for a target, that target is by definition <b>druggable.</b> If no known drugs bind to a target, then druggability is implied or predicted using different methods that rely on evolutionary relationships, 3D-structural properties or other descriptors.|$|E
50|$|His {{identification}} of the cytokine Interleukin 13 and the subsequent unearthing of its central role in allergic asthma led to his discovery of type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2).

50|$|Only 2% {{of human}} {{proteins}} interact with currently approved drugs. Furthermore, {{it is estimated}} that only 10-15% of human proteins are disease modifying while only 10-15% are <b>druggable</b> (there is no correlation between the two).

50|$|Malarial parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum {{have been}} shown to express a bi-functional enzyme that {{exhibits}} both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase activity, enabling it to catalyze the first two steps of the pentose phosphate pathway. This bifunctional enzyme has been identified as a <b>druggable</b> target for malarial parasites, and high-throughput screening of small molecule inhibitors has resulted in the discovery of novel compounds that can potentially be translated into potent antimalarials.|$|E
50|$|A {{potentially}} {{much larger}} percentage of proteins could be made <b>druggable</b> if protein-protein interactions could be disrupted by small molecules. However {{the majority of these}} interactions occur between relatively flat surfaces of the interacting protein partners and it is very difficult for small molecules to bind with high affinity to these surfaces. Hence these types of binding sites on proteins are generally thought to be undruggable but there has been some progress (by 2009) targeting these sites.|$|E
50|$|All {{methods for}} {{assessing}} druggability are {{highly dependent on}} the training sets used to develop them. This highlights an important caveat in all the methods discussed above: which {{is that they have}} learned from the successes so far. The training sets are typically either databases of curated drug targets; screened targets databases(ChEMBL, BindingDB, PubChem etc.); or on manually compiled sets of 3D structure known by the developers to be <b>druggable.</b> As training sets improve and expand, the boundaries of druggability may also be expanded.|$|E

50|$|Druggability is a {{term used}} in drug {{discovery}} to describe a biological target (such as a protein) that is known to or is predicted to bind with high affinity to a drug. Furthermore, by definition, the binding of the drug to a <b>druggable</b> target must alter {{the function of the}} target with a therapeutic benefit to the patient. The concept of druggability is most often restricted to small molecules (low molecular weight organic substances) but also has been extended to include biologic medical products such as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.|$|E

5000|$|Drug {{discovery}} comprises {{a number}} of stages that lead from a biological hypothesis to an approved drug. Target identification is typically {{the starting point of}} the modern drug discovery process. Candidate targets may be selected based on a variety of experimental criteria. These criteria may include disease linkage (mutations in the protein are known to cause a disease), mechanistic rationale (for example, the protein is part of a regulatory pathway that is involved in the disease process), or genetic screens in model organisms. [...] Disease relevance alone however is insufficient for a protein to become a drug target. In addition, the target must be <b>druggable.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{one study}} which {{utilized}} mice models indicated that acrosin {{is not a}} necessary component of zona pellucida penetration, other studies in humans have shown an association between low acrosomal proteinase activity and infertility. Other research groups have demonstrated a significant correlation between acrosin activity and sperm motility. In rabbit models, an intravaginal contraceptive device that secreted tetradecyl sodium sulfate, a known inhibitor of acrosin and hyaluronidases, had a complete contraceptive effect. Although its exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear, acrosin could thus serve as a novel target for contraceptive agents. Acrosin may represent as a uniquely <b>druggable</b> target due to its location and high cellular specificity. Thus, developing inhibitors of acrosin could {{provide the basis for}} safe, reversible male contraceptives, or female contraceptives through the use of intravaginal contraceptive devices.|$|E
50|$|The company {{initially}} {{focused on}} using gene knockout technology {{to define the}} function of genes. This effort complemented and benefited from the international effort to sequence the human and mouse genomes (see Human Genome Project). Using its proprietary gene trapping and gene targeting technologies, the company created the world’s largest repository of genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cells, known as OmniBank, and established a large-scale mammalian knockout program to discover the physiological and behavioral functions of the most <b>druggable</b> mammalian genes. The information collected from this program is stored in the company’s LexVision database, which contains almost 5,000 gene knockouts studied. Over the years, Lexicon evolved from a genomics company into a drug discovery and development company focused on discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. The company currently has multiple drug candidates {{in various stages of}} clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|In a {{targeted}} approach, sequencing of ctDNA can be directed towards a genetic panel constructed based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest. This {{is especially important}} for informing treatment in situations where mutations are identified in <b>druggable</b> targets. Personalizing targeted analysis of ctDNA to each patient is also possible by combining liquid biopsies with standard primary tissue biopsies. Whole genome or whole exome sequencing of the primary tumor biopsy allows for discovery of genetic mutations specific to a patient’s tumor, and can be used for subsequent targeted sequencing of the patient’s ctDNA. The highest sensitivity of ctDNA detection is accomplished through targeted sequencing of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Commonly mutated genes, such as oncogenes, which typically have hotspot mutations, are good candidates for targeted sequencing approaches. Conversely, most tumor suppressor genes have a wide array of possible loss of function mutations throughout the gene, and as such are not suitable for targeted sequencing.|$|E

Our findings suggested that mechanisms need to be established to deal with spelling errors and irregularities in normalizing clinical drug data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), whereas the annotations from NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) and PubChem are two layers of normalization that potentially bridge between the clinical phenotypes and the <b>druggable</b> genome knowledge for effective cancer therapeutic target discovery. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{genome-wide}} {{identification of}} both morbid genes, i. e., those genes whose mutations cause hereditary human diseases, and <b>druggable</b> genes, i. e., genes coding for proteins whose modulation by small molecules elicits phenotypic effects, requires experimental approaches that are time-consuming and laborious. Thus, a computational approach which could accurately predict such genes on a genome-wide scale would be invaluable for accelerating {{the pace of}} discovery of causal relationships between genes and diseases {{as well as the}} determination of druggability of gene products. Results In this paper we propose a machine learning-based computational approach to predict morbid and <b>druggable</b> genes on a genome-wide scale. For this purpose, we constructed a decision tree-based meta-classifier and trained it on datasets containing, for each morbid and <b>druggable</b> gene, network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization data as learning attributes. This meta-classifier correctly recovered 65 % of known morbid genes with a precision of 66 % and correctly recovered 78 % of known <b>druggable</b> genes with a precision of 75 %. It was than used to assign morbidity and druggability scores to genes not known to be morbid and <b>druggable</b> and we showed a good match between these scores and literature data. Finally, we generated decision trees by training the J 48 algorithm on the morbidity and druggability datasets to discover cellular rules for morbidity and druggability and, among the rules, we found that the number of regulating transcription factors and plasma membrane localization are the most important factors to morbidity and druggability, respectively. Conclusions We were able to demonstrate that network topological features along with tissue expression profile and subcellular localization can reliably predict human morbid and <b>druggable</b> genes on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, by constructing decision trees based on these data, we could discover cellular rules governing morbidity and druggability. </p...|$|E

Our systematic evaluation of the druggability of all enzymes provides a convenient way of selecting targets that should be most easily inhibited by small-molecule drugs. We found that not every target is equally <b>druggable</b> and we identified novel, <b>druggable,</b> potentially allosteric sites. These results should accelerate the development of anti-infective drugs with a novel mode of action, which are needed ever more urgently {{in light of the}} rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} number of {{examples}} of small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt protein–protein interactions (PPIs), the origin of druggability of such targets is poorly understood. To identify <b>druggable</b> sites in protein–protein interfaces we combine computational solvent mapping, which explores the protein surface using a variety of small “probe” molecules, with a conformer generator to account for side-chain flexibility. Applications to unliganded structures of 15 PPI target proteins show that the <b>druggable</b> sites comprise a cluster of binding hot spots, distinguishable from other regions of the protein due to their concave topology combined with a pattern of hydrophobic and polar functionality. This combination of properties confers on the hot spots a tendency to bind organic species possessing some polar groups decorating largely hydrophobic scaffolds. Thus, <b>druggable</b> sites at PPI are not simply sites that are complementary to particular organic functionality, but rather possess a general tendency to bind organic compounds with a variety of structures, including key side chains of the partner protein. Results also highlight the importance of conformational adaptivity at the binding site to allow the hot spots to expand to accommodate a ligand of drug-like dimensions. The critical components of this adaptivity are largely local, involving primarily low energy side-chain motions within 6  Å of a hot spot. The structural and physicochemical signature of <b>druggable</b> sites at PPI interfaces is sufficiently robust to be detectable from the structure of the unliganded protein, even when substantial conformational adaptation is required for optimal ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} <b>druggable</b> pockets {{on the surface}} of a protein is often {{performed}} on a single conformer, treated as a rigid body. Transient <b>druggable</b> pockets may be missed in this approach. Here, we describe a methodology for systematic in silico analysis of surface clefts across multiple conformers of the metastable protein α 1 -antitrypsin (A 1 AT). Pathological mutations disturb the conformational landscape of A 1 AT, triggering polymerisation that leads to emphysema and hepatic cirrhosis. Computational screens for small molecule inhibitors of polymerisation have generally focused on one major <b>druggable</b> site visible in all crystal structures of native A 1 AT. In an alternative approach, we scan all surface clefts observed in crystal structures of A 1 AT and in 100 computationally produced conformers, mimicking the native solution ensemble. We assess the persistence, variability and druggability of these pockets. Finally, we employ molecular docking using publicly available libraries of small molecules to explore scaffold preferences for each site. Our approach identifies a number of novel target sites for drug design. In particular one transient site shows favourable characteristics for druggability due to high enclosure and hydrophobicity. Hits against this and other <b>druggable</b> sites achieve docking scores corresponding to a Kd in the µM–nM range, comparing favourably with a recently identified promising lead. Preliminary ThermoFluor studies support the docking predictions. In conclusion, our strategy shows considerable promise compared with the conventional single pocket/single conformer approach to in silico screening. Our best-scoring ligands warrant further experimental investigation...|$|E
