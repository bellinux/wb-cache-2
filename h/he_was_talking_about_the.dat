500|$|The {{following}} night, {{the band}} opened for Willie Nelson at Toronto's prestigious Massey Hall. A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, {{with people in}} the audience yelling [...] "here comes the gravy!" [...] when Thornton tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host. Before the show, when asked about his [...] "gravy" [...] comment, Thornton claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> radio host. Local reviews of Thornton's Toronto performance were not positive. Toronto Star called Thornton's voice a [...] "high, tinny whine" [...] and The Globe and Mail commented that [...] "Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things". On April 10, The Boxmasters dropped out of the tour early, announcing {{that they would not be}} playing with Nelson during subsequent concerts scheduled in London, Ontario and Montreal. Thornton said that band members had come down with the flu. Willie Nelson's publicist had no comment.|$|E
500|$|Developed {{over the}} years 1926–1929 at Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Langley Field in Virginia, a forward-looking {{doctrine}} of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by four instructors who argued that an enemy's army and navy could be defeated intact due {{to the destruction of}} industrial and military targets deep within enemy-held territory. This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet, though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed. In contrast, American theorists devised a strategy of pin-point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons. Though unproven, the major attraction of this sort of strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly, with minimal casualties, and that grinding, static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided. In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said [...] "the bomber will always get through", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> terror bombing of cities. The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission. They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets, not populations.|$|E
2500|$|Arnett {{wrote the}} {{following}} {{in one of}} his most iconic dispatches, published on 7 February 1968, about the provincial capital Bến Tre: [...] "'It became necessary to destroy the town to save it,' a United States major said today. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decision by allied commanders to bomb and shell the town regardless of civilian casualties, to rout the Vietcong." [...] The quotation was distorted in subsequent publications, eventually becoming the more familiar, [...] "We had to destroy the village in order to save it." [...] The accuracy of the original quotation and its source have often been called into question. [...] Arnett never revealed his source, except {{to say that it was}} one of four officers he interviewed that day. US Army Major Phil Cannella, the senior officer present at Bến Tre, suggested that the quotation might have been a distortion of something he said to Arnett. The New Republic at the time attributed the quotation to US Air Force Major Chester L. Brown. In Walter Cronkite's 1971 book, Eye on the World, Arnett reasserted that the quotation was something [...] "one American major said to me in a moment of revelation." ...|$|E

She was carrying a tiny Chinese spaniel under one arm; with the fingers of her other hand she held a tortoise-shell mounted monocle to her eye, and stared directly at the two men.

6000|$|Some fault was found, and I do not in {{the least}} complain, with the {{deportation}} of two native gentlemen. I do not quarrel with the man who finds fault with that proceeding. To take anybody and deport him without bringing any charge against him, and with no intention of bringing him to trial, is a step that, I think, the House is perfectly justified in calling me to account for. I have done my best to account for it, and to-day, anyone who knows the Punjab, would agree that, whatever may happen at some remote period, its state is comparatively quiet and satisfactory. I am not going to repeat my justification of that strong measure of deportation, but I should like to read to the House the words of the Viceroy in the Legislative Council in November last, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> circumstances with which we had to deal.

6000|$|This {{brings me}} to remark a really {{singular}} trait. In spite of the predominance of practical sagacity, of the habits and spirit of public business, of vigorous actuality in Burke's character, yet {{at the bottom of}} all his thoughts about communities and governments there lay a certain mysticism. It was no irony, no literary trope, when he talked of our having taught the American husbandman [...] "piously to believe in the mysterious virtue of wax and parchment." [...] He was using no idle epithet, when he described the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, [...] "moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race." [...] To him there actually was an element of mystery in the cohesion of men in societies, in political obedience, in the sanctity of contract; in all that fabric of law and charter and obligation, whether written or unwritten, which is the sheltering bulwark between civilisation and barbarism. When reason and history had contributed all that they could to the explanation, it seemed to him as if the vital force, the secret of organisation, the binding framework, must still come from the impenetrable regions beyond reasoning and beyond history. There was another great conservative writer of that age, whose genius was aroused into a protest against the revolutionary spirit as vehement as Burke's. This was Joseph de Maistre, one of the most learned, witty, and acute of all reactionary philosophers. De Maistre wrote a book on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions. He could only find this principle in the operation of occult and supernatural forces, producing the half-divine legislators who figure mysteriously in the early history of nations. Hence he held, and with astonishing ingenuity enforced, the doctrine that nothing else could deliver Europe from the Satanic forces of revolution--he used the word Satanic in all literal seriousness--save the divinely inspired supremacy of the Pope. No natural operations seemed at all adequate either to produce or to maintain the marvel of a coherent society. We are reminded of a professor who, in the fantastic days of geology, explained the Pyramids of Egypt to be the remains of a volcanic eruption, which had forced its way upwards by a slow and stately motion; the hieroglyphs were crystalline formations; and the shaft of the great Pyramid was the air-hole of a volcano. De Maistre preferred a similar explanation of the monstrous structures of modern society. The hand of man could never have reared, and could never uphold them. If we cannot say that Burke laboured in constant travail with the same perplexity, it is at least true that he was keenly alive to it, and {{that one of the reasons}} why he dreaded to see a finger laid upon a single stone of a single political edifice, was his consciousness that he saw no answer to the perpetual enigma how any of these edifices had ever been built, and how the passion, violence, and waywardness of the natural man had ever been persuaded to bow their necks to the strong yoke of a common social discipline. Never was mysticism more unseasonable; never was an hour when men needed more carefully to remember Burke's own wise practical precept, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> British rule in India, that we must throw a sacred veil over the beginnings of government. Many woes might perhaps have been saved to Europe, if Burke had applied this maxim to the government of the new France.|$|E

museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he

50|$|James Soong {{restricted}} {{the use of}} Taiwanese and other local tongues in broadcasting while serving as Director of the Government Information Office earlier in his career, but later {{became one of the}} first Mainlander politicians to use Taiwanese in semi-formal occasions. Since then, politicians opposed to Taiwanese independence have used it frequently in rallies, even when they are not native speakers and speak it poorly. Conversely, politicians who have traditionally been identified with Taiwan independence have used Mandarin on formal occasions and semi-formal occasions such as press conferences. An example of the latter is former President Chen Shui-bian who uses Mandarin in all official state speeches, but uses mainly Taiwanese in political rallies and some informal state occasions such as New Year greetings. The current DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen have been criticised by her supporters for not using Taiwanese in speeches. President Ma Ying-jeou spoke in Taiwanese during his 2008 Double Ten Day speech when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state of the economy in Taiwan.|$|E
