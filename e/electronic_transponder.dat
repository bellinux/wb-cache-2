5000|$|A MnPASS <b>electronic</b> <b>transponder</b> is {{required}} in order to pay tolls because there are no tollbooths on the roadway. The price varies depending on the time of day and flow of traffic. Lone drivers were previously allowed to use the express lanes in off-peak times, but this is no longer allowed under the new system unless the sign says the cost is [...] "OPEN," [...] meaning free. The decision to make the non-reversible lanes free on off-hours was reached due to complaints about essentially making a four-lane freeway in an area that even on off-hours sorely needed six. Toll rates are expected to generally fall between $1 and $4, with a potential maximum of $8. Off-hours are charged as $0.25 on the reversible lanes and free on the one-way lanes. The white line-separated and reversible expressway sections are priced separately. The lanes are still open free to buses, motorcycles, and cars with 2 or more persons, no matter the time of day, and such vehicles do not require transponders to use the lanes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid antenna design for an optically powered {{super high frequency}} (SHF) radio frequency identification transponder applicable for the integration into metal. The key feature of the antenna {{is its ability to}} receive microwave signals at SHF for data communication and optical signals for the power supply of the transponder. The antenna design is based on a circular waveguide which is filled with a bundle of polymer optical fibers to guide light to the photodiodes. In addition, a transition is placed within the circular waveguide to transfer the waveguide mode of the SHF signal into a microstrip mode which is a more suitable structure for the integration of <b>electronic</b> <b>transponder</b> components.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that both nutrient-driven processes acting from the “bottom-up” and predator-driven processes acting from the “top-down” are important drivers of population change. However, studies that examine how these joint forces influence the population dynamics of oceanic species are lacking. In the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic ecosystem, human-mediated changes have driven biological change {{at both ends}} of the food chain; rapid regional warming at the bottom and heavy exploitation of apex predator populations at the top. Consequently, many populations of marine predators have rapidly changed in size over the last 50 -years. Unravelling the effects of bottom-up and top-down forcing on these open ocean ecosystems, has thus been highlighted as an immediate priority for polar scientists. The overall aims of this study were to use demographic, environmental and diet data to unravel the processes that contributed to a population of macaroni penguins at South Georgia declining rapidly between 1985 and 2012. I use mark–recapture modelling to examine the survival rates of macaroni penguins. Over 10 years, birds were marked with subcutaneous <b>electronic</b> <b>transponder</b> tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. These findings were combined with a 28 -year time series of population counts and productivity measurements in an age-structured state-space population model to disentangle the processes underlying the observed population decline. Finally, I combined stable isotope analysis and tracking data to investigate the individual strategies macaroni penguins might employ to mitigate the effects of density-dependence during the breeding season. Macaroni penguins at South Georgia declined at 6 % per year between 1985 and 2000, stabilising thereafter. This study indicates that the population declined in response to recruitment rates being lower than adult mortality. This trend was potentially accelerated by three large mortality events that were possibly associated with top-down predation pressure from giant petrels. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year, increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards. Year-to-year variability in demographic rates was induced by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates on survival rates was age-specific, whereby predation pressure had a considerably greater effect during the fledgling year compared with birds older than 1 -year. The population trajectory stabilised after 2000 in response to an increase in survival, as well as density-dependent feedbacks upon productivity. In order to minimise the effects of density-dependence during the breeding season and optimise daily energy expenditure, macaroni penguins appeared to make distinct dietary choices that remained highly consistent from year-to-year. Individually specialised foraging strategies occurred in response to seasonal variations in foraging range, conspecific density and prey availability at the foraging sites. The future stability of this population will depend on the carrying capacity of the environment supporting productivity rates at their present level, and the population size and breeding success of giant petrels not increasing so that adult survival rates can remain stable. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life-stages when examining the demography of seabirds, and demonstrates the additional insights that can be gained by using models with increased precision...|$|E

The options include an electronic button tag in the ear, an implantable electronic chip in the ear base or an electronic bolus placed in the rumen/reticular via the oesophageal route. • Aseries of experiments which compared different implantation sites for electronic chips found that the most suitable site for implantation was under the scutellar cartridge of the ear. This site gave very good retention values and was also a secure site, however, {{it was not possible to}} palpate the transponder. • The recovery of injectable transponders post slaughter was problematic and as a result due to potential risk of implantable transponder entering the food chain it was not possible to recommend the injectable (implantable route). • Electronic rumen boluses with a specific density less than 2 were rapidly expelled from the rumen, with 100 % expulsion by day 56 following placement in the reticulo-rumen. • Rumen boluses with a specific density of 2. 75 and greater had an annual non reading rate of less than 1 %, however, the loss rate in adult beef cows was greater than in growing and finishing cattle. The reason for this difference was unclear and may be diet related. • Recovery of boluses at slaughter was undertaken in the offal hall and generally the bolus was present in the reticulum and was easily detected by palpating the reticulum. One hundred percent recovery was not achieved in practice, various unforseen events including accidental dislodgment and cutting techniques prevented recovery. • Abolus dispenser with a long connection will facilitate delivery of the bolus directly to the calf’s reticulum. • <b>Electronic</b> failure of <b>transponders</b> in the reticulo-rumen was not a problem and read-failure rate was associated with boluses expelled from the reticulo-rumen. • There was no differences in read-failure rate (or loss rate) between two commercial boluses which were compared in different catgories of cattle. • Electronic button tags from two commercial companies were compared and it was found that any difference between the electronic button ear tags was associated with a defective applicator taggers. • Overall, the animal loss rate for electronic button tags was somewhat higher than that reported for electronic rumen boluses.
