5|$|Poeppigii group: Species with plicate {{internal}} peridial walls, hairy to shaggy outer walls, dark {{to black}} peridioles, and large, roughly spherical or <b>ellipsoidal</b> spores.|$|E
5|$|Ascospores are <b>ellipsoidal</b> in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions}} of 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have {{dimensions of}} 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} <b>ellipsoidal</b> or broadly <b>ellipsoidal</b> in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{satellite}} system is very lopsided: one moon, Titan, comprises more than 96% {{of the mass}} in orbit around the planet. The six other planemo (<b>ellipsoidal)</b> moons constitute roughly 4% of the mass, and the remaining 55 small moons, together with the rings, comprise only 0.04%.|$|E
5|$|Thebe is irregularly shaped, {{with the}} closest <b>ellipsoidal</b> {{approximation}} being 116×98×84km. Its surface area is probably between 31,000 and 59,000 (~45,000) km2. Its bulk density and mass are not known, but assuming that its mean density {{is like that}} of Amalthea (around 0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated at roughly 4.3kg.|$|E
5|$|Gravitationally rounded {{objects in}} the Solar System have a rounded, <b>ellipsoidal</b> shape due to the forces of their own gravity (hydrostatic equilibrium) and their sizes range from dwarf planets and moons to the planets and the sun. This list does not include any small Solar System bodies, but it does include a sample of planetary-mass objects whose shape {{has yet to be}} {{accurately}} determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the Galactic Center, while all other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are <b>ellipsoidal,</b> {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).|$|E
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly <b>ellipsoidal,</b> and typically measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly <b>ellipsoidal</b> or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an <b>ellipsoidal</b> section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to <b>ellipsoidal,</b> {{measuring}} 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8µm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8µm high {{and an almost}} complete reticulum comprising broad, rounded ridges. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (made of gelatinous hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) up to 60µm thick, with hyphae that are 2–6wide that are usually branched and interwoven.|$|E
5|$|When {{subjected}} to external forces, like electrical fields, {{the shape of}} an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant <b>ellipsoidal</b> deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite-type compounds.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel {{discovered}} {{the first two}} moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, {{and the other three}} <b>ellipsoidal</b> moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, the Fat Man was {{assembled}} on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel. When {{the physics}} package was fully assembled and wired, it was placed inside its <b>ellipsoidal</b> aerodynamic bombshell and wheeled out, {{where it was}} signed by nearly 60 people, including Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell and Captain William S. Parsons. It was then wheeled to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar after its normally assigned command pilot, Captain Frederick C. Bock, who flew The Great Artiste with his crew on the mission. Bockscar was flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew, with Commander Frederick L. Ashworth from Project Alberta as the weaponeer {{in charge of the}} bomb.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km in diameter. At about 400km in diameter, it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully <b>ellipsoidal.</b> This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and <b>ellipsoidal</b> or oval in shape. Viewed with a microscope, {{they appear}} {{translucent}} (hyaline), and stain red or blue with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of sterile cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an <b>ellipsoidal</b> profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} <b>ellipsoidal,</b> binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Titan is {{the sixth}} <b>ellipsoidal</b> moon from Saturn. Frequently {{described}} as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger than Earth's Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and {{is larger than the}} smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's Moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have <b>ellipsoidal</b> to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, <b>ellipsoidal</b> shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Circini is {{a binary}} star 450light-years away, whose {{components}} need a telescope of 150mm to be seen, {{as they are}} only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating <b>ellipsoidal</b> variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32light-years (10parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable {{to the naked eye}} for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, <b>ellipsoidal</b> to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with {{dimensions}} of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Spores {{are roughly}} <b>ellipsoidal</b> in shape with a Q ratio (the {{fraction}} of length/width) of 1.6, and dimensions of 9.4–15.4 by 6.2–9.0μm. They have a small, oblique , lack oil droplets, and are smooth with thin walls, and hyaline (translucent). The spores are acyanophilous and strongly amyloid, meaning they stain with Methyl blue and Melzer's reagent, respectively. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored (rarely two-spored) and club-shaped with long, robust sterigmata up to 6.0μm long; they have clamp connections at their bases, and measure 35.3–49.6 by 10.3–14.4μm. Roridomyces austrororidus has {{two types of}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges). One is rare, broadly club-shaped, and tapers to a narrow stem; it measures 24.1–39.5 by 6.8–12.7μm. The other cheilocystidia are moderately dense to abundant, and form a sterile gill edge. They are cylindrical, measuring 27.5–70.4 by 5.4–10.4μm, and often have a swollen tip that splits into two, rarely three branches.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Saturn are {{numerous}} and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer {{across to the}} enormous Titan, which {{is larger than the}} planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be <b>ellipsoidal</b> in shape, though only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition {{is similar to that of}} comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate presence of liquid water under its south pole region and could potentially harbor a global ocean under its surface.|$|E

25|$|Gregorian– Similar to the Cassegrain design {{except that}} the {{secondary}} reflector is concave, (<b>ellipsoidal)</b> in shape. Aperture efficiency over 70% can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|The major {{components}} of an ERS light are the casing {{in which the}} internal parts are mounted, an <b>ellipsoidal</b> reflector located {{in the back of}} the casing, a lamp mounted to position the filament at the rear focal point of the ellipsoid, a dual plano-convex lens (two plano-convex lenses facing each other in the barrel), and at the front, a gel frame to hold the color gel. The light from the lamp is efficiently gathered by the <b>ellipsoidal</b> reflector and sent forward through the gate, shutters and lens system.|$|E
25|$|The {{permeability}} of skin {{relative to}} different shapes of nanoparticles {{has also been}} studied. Research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to oblong (<b>ellipsoidal)</b> particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spatial dimensions. One study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas <b>ellipsoidal</b> particles were mainly found in the stratum corneum and epidermal layers. Nanorods are used in experiments because of their unique fluorescent properties but have shown mediocre penetration.|$|E
25|$|More generally, if the {{lightness}} {{is allowed}} to vary, then we find the tolerance set to be <b>ellipsoidal.</b> Increasing the weighting factor in the aforementioned distance expressions {{has the effect of}} increasing the size of the ellipsoid along the respective axis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{algorithms}} {{for solving}} linear-programming problems {{are described in}} the linear-programming article. Another basis-exchange pivoting algorithm is the criss-cross algorithm. There are polynomial-time algorithms for linear programming that use interior point methods: these include Khachiyan's <b>ellipsoidal</b> algorithm, Karmarkar's projective algorithm, and path-following algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structures}} of the enterotoxins reveals that they are compact, <b>ellipsoidal</b> proteins sharing a characteristic two-domain folding pattern comprising an NH2-terminal β barrel globular domain known as the oligosaccharide / oligonucleotide fold, a long α-helix that diagonally spans {{the center of the}} molecule, and a COOH terminal globular domain.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates {{may be found in}} Geographic coordinate conversion. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in Spherical coordinate system. The relation of Cartesian and <b>ellipsoidal</b> coordinates is discussed in Torge.|$|E
25|$|The Cookeina have asci {{which are}} {{constricted}} abruptly below {{and form a}} blunt, rounded base with a slim, tail-like connection. They have asci which mature simultaneously rather than in series. They have paraphyses which anastomose and form a three-dimensional network. Ascospores are large (20—40µm long), <b>ellipsoidal</b> or slightly unequal-sided, and either smooth or ornamented with fine wrinkles.|$|E
25|$|Projection {{construction}} is also affected by how {{the shape of}} the Earth or planetary body is approximated. In the following section on projection categories, the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth's actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid. Whether spherical or <b>ellipsoidal,</b> the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.|$|E
25|$|Ceres is {{the only}} {{asteroid}} with a fully <b>ellipsoidal</b> shape and hence {{the only one that}} is a dwarf planet. It has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids, of around 3.32, and may possess a surface layer of ice. Like the planets, Ceres is differentiated: it has a crust, a mantle and a core. No meteorites from Ceres have been found on Earth.|$|E
