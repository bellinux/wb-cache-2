500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial two defendants were acquitted and the remainder found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent, the lesser charge of conspiracy to riot automatically being dropped when guilty verdicts were announced on the first charge. When passing sentence, the judge remarked [...] "You <b>had</b> <b>your</b> period of arrogance and violence in front of the world, but now the price must be paid and paid by you". The defendants received sentences ranging from four years to ten years imprisonment, although only five defendants were in court to hear the verdict as six defendants were still on the run after escaping and another was being treated at Ashworth Secure Hospital.|$|E
500|$|Another {{execution}} {{was staged}} as a cruel {{twist on the}} story of Orpheus, who supposedly charmed the plants and flowers with his song after he lost Eurydice. In the version presented at the inaugural games, the tree and animals were charmed just as in the story, except for an [...] "unappreciative" [...] bear which tore the minstrel to pieces. It is likely that the harmless creatures were released first to give the impression of the story proceeding as planned before the bear was released to dispatch the unfortunate criminal forced into the role of Orpheus, whose probable restraint prevented him fleeing. Ironic reinterpretations of the myths may have been popular: in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions [...] "Daedalus" [...] being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words [...] "how you must wish you <b>had</b> <b>your</b> feathers now".|$|E

[...] In the same year David Cordingly wrote that [...] "The boldness of the attack [...] [...] [...] was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair." [...] Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy.

[...] "You Got Me" [...] features rap verses from Jay-Z and Freeway, was noted by Carey as a [...] "signature Just Blaze track". Jay-Z was in Capri on [...] vacation, and went to the studio to hear the song and said that he wanted to contribute to it and added rap verses of his own. Dupri produced [...] "The One" [...] and [...] "You <b>Had</b> <b>Your</b> Chance". He said that they wanted to stick to the [...] "same familiar sound" [...] from his previous collaborations with Carey. Carey said [...] "The One" [...] was a personal song, which was about being hurt in past relationships and the uncertainty about forming new ones. Carey decided to experiment with a live band for the album. In April 2002, she met 7 Aurelius and asked him to produce songs for the album. They flew to Nassau, Bahamas and recorded a mixture of mid-tempo and up-tempo tracks and ballads with a live band. 7 Aurelius said that Carey was [...] "an amazing writer" [...] and described the process of recording: ...|$|E

2500|$|The terms inoculation, {{vaccination}} and immunization {{are often}} used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries. However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine, inoculation referred only {{to the practice of}} variolation until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798, this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation continued to be referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine and vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g. diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc., and the question e.g. [...] "Have you <b>had</b> <b>your</b> flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?" [...] should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and why, not the literal meaning of the technique used.|$|E
2500|$|After {{over forty}} {{years on the}} air {{one of the most}} {{important}} aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience.

In the [...] "Film Club" [...] round any reference by Graeme Garden to Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is sure to cause a similar response. The game [...] "Wobbling Bunnies" [...] was introduced several times by Humph, often with eager anticipation by the panel and audience, but time pressures always meant the game was never actually played.

The characters were [...] developed into their own Radio 4 show, Hamish and Dougal. Another long-running gag involves one of the panellists putting forward a challenge of [...] "hesitation" [...] when another panellist leaves a long pause in the middle of speaking, a reference to Radio 4's other long-running panel show Just a Minute.
