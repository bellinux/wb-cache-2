50|$|Inside {{the coil}} was the <b>electron-photon</b> <b>calorimeter</b> (ECAL), {{designed}} for the highest possible angular resolution and electron identification. It consisted of alternating layers of lead and proportional tubes read out in 73,728 projective towers, each subdivided into three depth zones.The central detector for charged particles was the time projection chamber (TPC), 4.4 m long and 3.6 m in diameter. It provided a three dimensional measurement of each track segment. In addition, it provided up to 330 ionisation measurements for a track; this was useful for particle identification. The TPC surrounded the inner track chamber (ITC); an axial-wire drift chamber with inner and outer diameters of 13 cm and 29 cm and a length of 2 m. It provided 8 track coordinates and a trigger signal for charged particles {{that came from the}} interaction point.Closest to the beam pipe, was a silicon strip vertex detector. For each track, this measured two pairs of coordinates, 6.3 cm and 11 cm away from the beam axis over a length of 40 cm along the beam line.The beam pipe, made out of beryllium, had a diameter of 16 cm. The vacuum inside was about 10âˆ’15 atm.|$|E
