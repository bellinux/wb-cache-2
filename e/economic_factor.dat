We investigate the role of common <b>economic</b> <b>factors</b> in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of common <b>economic</b> <b>factors.</b> We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional common <b>economic</b> <b>factors</b> are incorporated into our model. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common <b>economic</b> <b>factors</b> than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common <b>economic</b> <b>factors</b> in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{museums are}} a central aspect of Basel's touristic appeal and hence an {{important}} <b>economic</b> <b>factor.</b> A number of Basel's museums are public institutions {{but the majority}} are privately sponsored, backed in most cases by foundations. Helping to generate the high density of museums compared to other cities and metropolitan areas of similar size, these private collections have also made a substantial contribution to {{the high level of}} museum quality. The private collections nearly all came into being after the Second World War. Most of the public museums, by contrast, date from before the war. In fact, the collections of the five publicly run museums of the canton of Basel-City have histories that go back several centuries.|$|E

25|$|Cotton {{production}} {{is an important}} <b>economic</b> <b>factor</b> in the United States as the country leads, worldwide, in cotton exportation. The United States is ranked third in production, behind China and India. Almost all of the cotton fiber growth and production occurs in southern and western states, dominated by Texas, California, Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana. More than 99 percent of the cotton grown in the US is of the Upland variety, with the rest being American Pima. Cotton {{production is}} a $25billion-per-year industry in the United States, employing over 200,000 people in total, as against growth of forty billion pounds a year from 77 million acres of land covering more than eighty countries. The final estimate of U.S. cotton production in 2012 was 17.31 million bales, with the corresponding figures for China and India being 35 million and 26.5 million bales, respectively.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} to this criticism units based at Celle voluntarily restrict themselves to circle the aerodrome only over the mostly uninhabited area {{to the south of}} the air base and to avoid training approaches over Westercelle as much as possible. Flight movements at lunch time are kept to a minimum. Approach as well as departure over densely populated areas is prohibited. These restrictions relieve the built-up areas surrounding the air base of noise pollution to a certain degree. They have, however, the effect that flight movements are now channelled along the remaining routes permitted leading to an increase of noise and of annoyance to the population affected. Since many retired soldiers and staff formerly working at the base still live in and around Celle there are not only critics of the air base but also supporters who voice their opinion in various forums and letters to the editor stressing the <b>economic</b> <b>factor</b> of the air base {{and the fact that the}} air base had existed since 1934 so that the opponents were in full knowledge of its existence when they bought property at reduced prices in its vicinity.|$|E

Sectoral and demographic factors help explain why certain people within a given country are more likely than others to be working poor.

2500|$|Despite {{optimized}} yields {{greater than}} 95% with excellent purity, the synthesis has shortcomings. Due to high reaction temperature, approximately 5% of the acetic acid solvent is lost by decomposition or [...] "burning". Solvent burning {{is a significant}} <b>economic</b> <b>factor</b> in the oxidation process. In addition, product loss by decarboxylation to benzoic acid is common. The high temperature diminishes oxygen solubility in an already oxygen-starved system. Pure oxygen cannot {{be used in the}} traditional system due to hazards of flammable organic–O2 mixtures. Atmospheric air can be used in its place, but once reacted needs to be purified of toxins and ozone depleters such as methylbromide before being released.

Based on a theory that debt {{is the number one}} <b>economic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one [...] "moral evil" [...] and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the 2nd edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.|$|E
