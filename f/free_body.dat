Scarf {{initiated the}} study of maximal lattice <b>free</b> <b>bodies</b> relative to the facet normals in a fixed matrix. In this paper we give an efficient algorithm for computing the maximal lattice <b>free</b> <b>bodies</b> of an integral (d + 1) × d matrix A. An important ingredient is a test set for a certain integer program associated with A. This test set may be computed using algebraic methods. As an application we generalize the Scarf-Shallcross algorithm for the three-dimensional Frobenius problem to arbitrary dimension. In this context our method is inspired by the novel algorithm by Einstein, Lichtblau, Strzebonski and Wagon and the Gröbner basis approach by Roune. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can only be {{described}} relative to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a <b>free</b> <b>body</b> that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at the next instant, even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a <b>free</b> <b>body</b> in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E
25|$|Coulomb (1776) first {{studied the}} problem of lateral earth {{pressures}} on retaining structures. He used limit equilibrium theory, which considers the failing soil block as a <b>free</b> <b>body</b> {{in order to determine}} the limiting horizontal earth pressure. The limiting horizontal pressures at failure in extension or compression are used to determine the Ka and Kp respectively. Since the problem is indeterminate, a number of potential failure surfaces must be analysed to identify the critical failure surface (i.e. the surface that produces the maximum or minimum thrust on the wall). Mayniel (1908) later extended Coulomb's equations to account for wall friction, symbolized by δ. Müller-Breslau (1906) further generalized Mayniel's equations for a non-horizontal backfill and a non-vertical soil-wall interface (represented by angle θ from the vertical).|$|E

A 3-month study investigated whether there was any motor benefit of music therapy and physical therapy on Parkinson's Disease patients, and whether the therapies had any effect on their emotional well being and their quality of life. The music therapy consisted of choral singing, voice exercise and rhythmic and <b>free</b> <b>body</b> movements, whereas the physical therapy consisted of stretching exercises, specific motor tasks and ways to improve balance and gait. The study concluded that music therapy had a beneficial effect on the patient's emotions, it showed an improvement in bradykinesia, and in quality of life. Music therapy however lacked any motor benefit, whereas physical therapy showed that it improved the rigidity of the patients.|$|E

If the object is on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because less of {{the force of gravity}} is perpendicular to the face of the plane. Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined using vector analysis, usually via a <b>free</b> <b>body</b> diagram. Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity.|$|E
