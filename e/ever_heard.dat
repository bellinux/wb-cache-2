You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of his ships again.|$|E

5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E

25|$|Allessandro {{played with}} false teeth for years. For Herbert L. Clarke, Bent and Liberati {{were one of}} the best soloists he <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> Allessandro also made a number of {{recordings}} for Edison in the 1890s.|$|E

25|$|Carlill {{then joined}} the Brit pop superband Lodger, whose single ’’I'm Leaving’’ (Island Records), on their album “A Walk in the Park”, reached the UK Top 40 in 1998. Carlill’s voice was {{characterized}} as unlike anything one had <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> {{in reference to}} emotional songs.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because their}} unusual melody and heavy accented rhythms are unlike {{anything}} <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> in a Manhattan revue before, partly {{because there is}} not a clue to their meaning except the gay rolling of Carmen Miranda's insinuating eyes, these songs, and Miranda herself, are the outstanding hit of the show.|$|E
25|$|The exemplar {{models have}} to face several objections, {{two of which are}} (1) {{insufficient}} memory capacity to store every utterance <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> and, concerning the ability to produce what was heard, (2) whether also the talker's own articulatory gestures are stored or computed when producing utterances that would sound as the auditory memories.|$|E

25|$|A lean loose-jointed Negro had {{commenced}} plunking {{a guitar}} beside me while I slept... As he played, he pressed a knife on {{the strings of}} the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars....The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 90-minute {{pilot film}} that aired on March 21, 1976, {{received}} enormous ratings. However, the network ABC - who {{thought this was}} one of the worst ideas for a TV series they had <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> - didn't believe the figures and showed the pilot again a week later to check. The ratings were just as high, even for a repeat screening.|$|E
25|$|His trills, shakes and quavers are, {{like those}} {{of all the other}} great singers, {{tiresome}} to me; but his pure melody, the simple song clearly articulated, is equal to anything I <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> His song was acted as well as sung delightfully; I think Braham a fine actor while singing; he throws his soul into his throat, but his whole frame is animated, and his gestures and looks are equally impassioned.|$|E

25|$|As a {{synthesizer}} {{and electric}} keyboard player, Sun Ra ranks among {{one of the}} earliest and most radical pioneers. By the mid-1950s, he used a variety of electric keyboards, and almost immediately, he exploited their potential perhaps more than anyone, sometimes modifying them himself to produce sounds rarely if <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> before. His live albums from the late 1960s and early 1970s feature some of the noisiest, most bizarre keyboard work ever recorded.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2009, Breuning made an {{appearance}} on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, giving his views about {{the current state of}} the economy and the newly elected president. Breuning said that the first president he ever voted for was Woodrow Wilson, and that the most memorable news item he <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about in his life was the Wall Street Crash of 1929. He also described life during the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|George Washington {{nominated}} Rutledge to the Supreme Court of the United States as an Associate Justice on September 24, 1789. The United States Senate {{confirmed his}} appointment on September 26, 1789, and Washington signed both the commissions of Chief Justice John Jay and Rutledge that same day. On March 4, 1791, Rutledge {{resigned from the}} Supreme Court, without having <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> a case, {{in order to become}} Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas and Sessions.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, a man {{claimed to}} have frequented the Barrowland Ballroom with the suspect and {{confirmed}} that he knew the killer. The man said that {{he grew up with}} the killer in Cranhill in the east end of Glasgow. Apparently he had read an article in the Evening Times five years previously and suddenly realised that his friend was Bible John. The alleged suspect was traced living in the Netherlands, married to a Dutch woman. Nothing more was <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> from the man or the reputed suspect.|$|E
25|$|The {{audience}} {{broke into}} applause... John Philip Sousa : ', {{that is a}} band. This {{is the first time}} I have <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine'... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is not the result of innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 , or five and a half octaves... The 'phonograph tone' is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.|$|E
25|$|In July, 2016, the Valparaiso University Law Review {{published}} an article entitled How Frank Easterbrook Kept George Ryan in Prison (Frank H. Easterbrook was one of Ryan’s judges, on the Seventh Circuit Appellate Court). The article (styled a “memoir”) was authored by Professor Albert Alschuler, one of Ryan’s appellate attorneys. It made serious accusations of judicial misconduct against Judge Easterbrook, constituting perhaps the most explosive attack against a federal judge <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> This remains a cause célèbre in the legal community, though formal judicial misconduct complaints have not (yet) been filed, nor judicial reforms (yet) instituted.|$|E
