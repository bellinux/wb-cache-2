40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} of the U. K. government's air pollution emissions policy for the residential sector is undertaken. The analysis covers emissions arising from water and <b>space</b> <b>heating,</b> electric <b>appliances</b> and cooking appliances. Using an integrated economic-engineering model, the effects of the Energy Savings Trust and the imposition of Value Added Tax on residential fuel will be evaluated in terms of energy consumption and pollution emissions. It is found that the initial proposed policy was not sufficiently stringent to meet the government's environmental objectives, and that subsequent events have undermined the government's programme even further. Unless alternative policies are introduced, emissions from the residential sector will {{play an important role in}} jeopardizing the ability of the U. K. government to meet its international obligations. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1996 energy policy, pollution, resource conservation,...|$|R
40|$|The {{residential}} sector {{plays an important}} role in the energy system of developing countries. In this paper we introduce a bottom up simulation model for household energy use. The model describes energy demand for several end-use functions based on a set of physical drivers, such as floor <b>space</b> and <b>heating</b> degree days. The model also recognizes different population groups: i. e. urban and rural households, each distinguishing five income quintiles. The model is applied to analyze possible future developments of residential energy use in five developing world regions: India, China, South East Asia, South Africa and Brazil. We find that in each of these regions cooking is currently the main end-use function, but that other functions, such as <b>space</b> <b>heating,</b> cooling and <b>appliances</b> become more important. At the same time, energy consumption slowly shifts towards modern fuels. The model also shows that climate policy can reduce residential energy emissions, but could also slow down the energy transition away from traditional fuels in low income classes...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, a ``low-energy`` {{house has}} been one that used little energy for <b>space</b> <b>heating.</b> But <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> {{typically}} accounts for {{less than half of}} the energy used by new US homes, and for low <b>heating</b> energy homes, <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> is often the third largest end use, behind water <b>heating</b> and <b>appliances,</b> and sometimes behind cooling. Low <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> alone cannot identify a low-energy house. To better understand the determinants of a low-energy house, we collected data on housing characteristics, incremental costs, and energy measurements from energy-efficient houses around the world and in a range of climates. We compare the energy required to provide thermal comfort as well as water <b>heating,</b> and other <b>appliances.</b> We do not have a single definition of a low-energy house, but through comparisons of actual buildings, we show how different definitions and quantitative indicators fail. In comparing the energy use of whole houses, weather normalization can be important, but for cases in which heating or cooling energy is surpassed by other end uses, other normalization methods must be used...|$|R

40|$|Energy use in {{developing}} countries is heterogeneous across households. Present day global energy models are mostly too aggregate to account for this heterogeneity. Here, a bottom-up model for residential energy use that starts from key dynamic concepts on energy use {{in developing}} countries is presented and applied to India. Energy use and fuel choice is determined for five end-use functions (cooking, water <b>heating,</b> <b>space</b> <b>heating,</b> lighting and <b>appliances)</b> and for five different income quintiles in rural and urban areas. The paper specifically explores the consequences of different assumptions for income distribution and rural electrification on residential sector energy use and CO 2 emissions, finding that results are clearly sensitive to variations in these parameters. As a result of population and economic growth, total Indian residential energy use {{is expected to increase}} by around 65 – 75 % in 2050 compared to 2005, but residential carbon emissions may increase by up to 9 – 10 times the 2005 level. While a more equal income distribution and rural electrification enhance the transition to commercial fuels and reduce poverty, there is a trade-off in terms of higher CO 2 emissions via increased electricity use...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>appliances</b> used in {{buildings}} are designed according to building 2 ̆ 7 s heating load {{as a function}} of outdoor design air temperature.

40|$|Abstract: The {{housing sector}} is a {{significant}} contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts in most countries. With increase in population this problem {{is bound to be}} of importance and further reinforced by increasing desire for higher levels of affluence. It is also amenable to low cost clever design approaches to deal with the problems as well as the use of emerging technologies which help with localized energy capture on site. Most OECD countries are on path with regulations and standards for sustainable approaches to design but the real success may lie in market driven innovations. This is now increasingly evident. In Australia there have not been any regulations for this but now after the Olympics there is clear evidence of a market drive for sustainable housing. The Olympics projects were driven with a green commitment but now other developments are increasingly considering sustainability as a part of their marketing strategy. The requirements for energy performance ratings for <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling, <b>appliances,</b> water heaters and water and waste management strategies, materials selection for low impact together with subsidies for use of photovoltaic technologies is creating demand and awareness for a sustainable approach. This is also making way for building energy code to be introduced without much resistance.

40|$|Many New Zealand {{studies have}} argued that house energy {{retrofit}} produces limited benefits, but {{the issue of how}} existing house retrofitting can lead to better energy performance and comfort improvement is little explored. The aim of this thesis was to examine the influence of house retrofit on energy efficiency and thermal comfort, using house model simulation and calculation. This study gives a holistic house retrofit approach in thermal comfort improvement and energy conservation. Three house retrofit categories were defined by household energy breakdown: <b>Space</b> <b>Heating</b> Retrofit, Hot Water System Retrofit and Appliances Retrofit. This study started with an investigation of New Zealand existing house stock. A typical house model was defined by the summarized common physical characteristics. This house model was used for retrofit testing. For the building <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> retrofit study, a series of thermal simulations was completed with different retrofit options. Thermal simulation results were compared both in thermal comfort and <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> energy requirement. It was discovered that the optimum level full insulation retrofit significantly reduced <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> energy requirement and also improved thermal comfort. Retrofit solutions for water <b>heating,</b> lighting and <b>appliances</b> were compared by cost and energy saving. Cost effectiveness cross comparison for all of the retrofit solutions was carried out. Retrofitting for <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> system and hot water system can be considered for long term cost effectiveness. Appliances and lighting retrofit have a higher efficacy than other retrofit options in terms of energy saving and cost benefit cycle. These findings are used to provide suggestions for retrofitting of existing houses...|$|R
