The ablative liner is fabricated in two segments and installed from either end. The shape of the nozzle extension is such that the ablative liner is retained in the <b>exit</b> <b>cone</b> during transportation, launch and boost.

40|$|Several {{types of}} {{anomalous}} rayon based phenolic behavior {{have been observed}} in post-fired nozzles and <b>exit</b> <b>cones.</b> Many of these events {{have been shown to}} be related to the development of internal gas pressure within the material. The development of internal gas pressure is a function of the amount of gas produced within the material and the rate at which that gas is allowed to escape. The latter property of the material is referred to as the material's permeability. The permeability of two dimensional carbonized rayon based phenolic composites is a function of material direction, temperature, and stress/strain state. Recently significant differences in the permeability of these materials has been uncovered which may explain their inconsistent performance. This paper summarizes what is known about the permeability of these materials to date and gives possible implications of these finding to the performance of these materials in an ablative environment...|$|R

The target consists of two compartments: an accelerator and an injector section connected via an aperture. A sharp transition between the peak and plateau density regions in the injector and accelerator compartments, respectively, was observed in simulations with various inlet pressures. The fluid simulations indicate that {{the length of the}} down-ramp connecting the sections depends on the aperture diameter, as does the density drop outside the entrance and the <b>exit</b> <b>cones.</b> Further studies showed, that increasing the inlet pressure leads to turbulence and strong fluctuations in density along the axial profile during target filling, and consequently, is expected to negatively impact the accelerator stability...|$|R

50|$|Woven ceramic fabrics {{allow for}} the {{opportunity}} to create new, imaginative solutions for previously impossible problems. These fabrics are utilized for thermal, mechanical and electrical applications for a variety of reasons. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are most importantly used in three main fields: aerospace, electronic, and industrial. In aerospace, the fabrics are used in space shuttles for the <b>exit</b> <b>cone,</b> door seals, micrometeorite shield, gaskets, booster access doors, shuttle tiles, and in the Whipple shield. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are utilized in aerospace because they have low thermal conductivity and can be fabricated into high temperature thermal insulators. In the electronic industry, the fabrics are used primarily for insulation and seals, because of its low porosity. Ceramic fabric's industrial uses include furnace linings, furnace zone dividers, door seals, tube seals, gaskets, and expansion joints. In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, these fabrics do not shrink or elongate with high temperature changes, making them useful for industrial uses that involve high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Transportation {{monitoring}} unit (TMU) qualification testing was performed between 3 Mar. and 14 Dec. 1989. The {{purpose of the}} testing was to qualify the TMUs to monitor and store temperature and acceleration data on redesigned solid rocket motor segments and <b>exit</b> <b>cones</b> while they are being shipped from Utah's Thiokol Corporation, Space Operations, to Kennedy Space Center. TMUs were subjected to transportation tests that concerned the structural integrity of the TMUs only, and did not involve TMU measuring capability. This testing was terminated prior to completion due to mounting plate failures, high and low temperature shutdown failures, and data collection errors. Corrective actions taken by the vendor to eliminate high temperature shutdowns were ineffective. An evaluation {{was performed on the}} TMUs to determine the TMU vibration and temperature measuring accuracy at a variety of temperatures. This test demonstrated that TMU measured shock levels are high, and that TMUs are temperature sensitive because of decreased accuracy at high and low temperatures. It was determined that modifications to the current TMU system, such that it could be qualified for use, would require a complete redesign and remanufacture. Because the cost of redesigning and remanufacturing the present TMU system exceeds the cost of procuring a new system that could be qualified without modification, it is recommended that an alternate transportation monitoring system be qualified...|$|R

50|$|However, {{a larger}} exit pupil {{makes it easier}} to put the eye where it can receive the light: {{anywhere}} in the large <b>exit</b> pupil <b>cone</b> of light will do. This ease of placement helps avoid vignetting, which is a darkened or obscured view that occurs when the light path is partially blocked. And, it means that the image can be quickly found which is important when aiming at game animals that move rapidly. A narrow exit pupil telescopic sight may also be fatiguing because the instrument must be held exactly in place in front of the eyes to provide a useful image. Finally, many people in Europe use their telescopic sights at dusk, dawn and at night, when their pupils are larger. Thus the daytime exit pupil of about 3 to 4 mm is not a universally desirable standard. For comfort, ease of use, and flexibility in applications, larger telescopic sights with larger exit pupils are satisfying choices even if their capability is not fully used by day.|$|R

This paper gives not only {{the results of the study}} of air pulsations and methods of eliminating them, but also the effects of changing the exit-cone diameter and flare and the effects of air leakage from the return passage.

Water analogy flow {{visualisation}} and conductivity techniques {{with air}} bubbles and salt solution as tracers are relatively simple and cost-effective techniques for the {{qualitative and quantitative}} studies of turbulent fuel and air mixing and yet give very useful information about aerodynamic patterns and mixing characteristics of the system concerned. These techniques {{have been used to}} study the fuel placement effects on the flow aerodynamics and mixing characteristics of a series of multi-jet grid cone stabilised non-swirl flow. The experimental results showed that the degree of fuel and air mixing was largely governed by the internally-generated flow aerodynamics and the turbulent energy available.

This instability will occur in the loss <b>cone</b> <b>exits</b> of the nuclear debris bubble, and the accelerated ambient ions will freestream along the magnetic field lines into the magnetosphere. Using Starfish-like parameters and accounting for plasma diffusion and thermalization of the propagating plasma mass, it is found that synchronous orbit plasma fluxes of high temperature electrons (near 10 keV) will be significantly greater than those encountered during magnetospheric substorms.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet slot angle, spin chamber convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, spray cone half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet slot angle results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher spray cone angle. The spin chamber converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the spray cone angle decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and spray cone angle increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the spray cone angle and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer. The qualitative trends in the variation of film thickness at the atomizer <b>exit,</b> spray <b>cone</b> angle, and discharge coefficient predicted by inviscid flow analysis are seen to agree well with computational results...|$|R
50|$|Binoculars {{concentrate}} {{the light}} {{gathered by the}} objective into a beam, the exit pupil, whose diameter is the objective diameter divided by the magnifying power. For maximum effective light-gathering and brightest image, the exit pupil should equal {{the diameter of the}} fully dilated iris of the human eye — about 7 mm, reducing with age. If the cone of light streaming out of the binoculars is larger than the pupil it is going into, any light larger than the pupil is wasted and does not provide information to the eye. In daytime use the human pupil is typically dilated about 3 mm, which is about the exit pupil of a 7×21 binocular. Much larger 7×50 binoculars will produce a cone of light bigger than the pupil it is entering, and this light will, in the day, be wasted. It is therefore seemingly pointless to carry around a larger instrument. However, a larger exit pupil makes it easier to put the eye where it can receive the light: anywhere in the large <b>exit</b> pupil <b>cone</b> of light will do. This ease of placement helps avoid vignetting, which is a darkened or obscured view that occurs when the light path is partially blocked, and it means that the image can be quickly found which is important when looking at birds or game animals that move rapidly, or for a seaman on the deck of a pitching boat or ship. Narrow exit pupil binoculars may also be fatiguing because the instrument must be held exactly in place in front of the eyes to provide a useful image. Finally, many people use their binoculars at dusk, in overcast conditions, and at night, when their pupils are larger. Thus the daytime exit pupil is not a universally desirable standard. For comfort, ease of use, and flexibility in applications, larger binoculars with larger exit pupils are satisfying choices even if their capability is not fully used by day.|$|R
