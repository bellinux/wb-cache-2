5000|$|In 1973, Rayburn {{served as}} {{chairman}} of the Committee on Revenue, Finance and Taxation at the state Constitutional Convention, which produced the Louisiana Constitution of 1974. He served at the convention with future Governor Roemer and future Secretary of State and Insurance Commissioner James H. [...] "Jim" [...] Brown as well as such lawmakers as state Representatives R. Harmon Drew of Webster Parish and Frank Fulco of Caddo Parish. Rayburn advocated pay-as-you-go for state projects and insisted that local government fund its own projects.

5000|$|At about 12:30 am {{local time}} Yankee and Zulu Companies {{attacked}} the northern peak ('Summer Days') {{and after a}} very hard two-hour fight against two rifle platoons and despite heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, succeeded in capturing 'Summer Days'.

The British Marines also lost two platoon commanders wounded in the Argentine mortar bombardments with Marine Chris Cooke later recalling, [...] "The three officers in my company pledged {{to have a drink}} together {{at the other end of}} the island, but only one made it, the other two left with shrapnel wounds."

50|$|That {{same week}} strong rumours {{appeared}} about a move of Víctor Sánchez, who hadn’t finished a Liga match until then, to Liverpool FC. It was a choice for Deportivo to still {{get some money}} now, because Víctor’s contract was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> {{a few months later}} (like the contracts of Molina and César Martín), or to use the winger for the final part of the season. In the Liga itself, a win at Atlético was Depor’s aim to make it five in a row in away matches (which would mean a record in Depor’s history). Until then it had been a weird season with Deportivo only taking fifteen points out of eleven home matches but eighteen points out of nine away matches. However, one way or the other, the Galicians were heading towards qualification for European football and had a good chance of reaching the next phase in the Copa del Rey.|$|R
50|$|Still, {{after the}} good results at on-third of the season, {{there were some}} unhappy faces in Depor’s squad. Duscher and Scaloni {{remained}} having a somewhat difficult relationship with Caparrós. Duscher kept being related to foreign clubs. Scaloni openly defended the players whose contracts were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> in 2006 or 2007 and asked for negotiations. César and Juanma supported him. Lendoiro responded by saying that he didn’t expect players to concern themselves with “managerial aspects of the club”. Meanwhile, Tristán’s game kept being unconvincing after the difficulties {{he had in the}} final seasons under Irureta. He scored four goals in the first twelve Liga matches, including one penalty, but on the pitch still wasn’t the leader Caparrós wanted him to be. In the Cádiz match several weeks later, he was criticized by the Riazor crowd from the first minute even after having scored the only goal of the match. Finally, the smooth game of the earlier years had disappeared. Deportivo now more aimed at a physical game and scored a lot of their goals out of standard plays.|$|R

40|$|Crude oil {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} commodity to humans after water and food. Having a continuous and affordable supply of oil is considered a basic human right in this day and age. That is the main reason oil companies are in a constant search of cost effective ways and technologies that allow for an improved oil recovery rate. This would improve profitability as well. What almost everyone knows and dreads at the same time is that oil is an exhaustible resource. This means that as more oil is being produced every day, the amount of oil that remains to be produced shrinks even more. With almost all big oil fields worldwide having already been discovered, the challenge of finding new reserves grows harder and harder. A question that has always been asked is ??????when are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> oil??????? Given the available technologies and techniques, no one could give an exact answer and if someone does, he/she would not be 100 % sure of that answer. This study tries to approximate future oil production rates to the year 2050 using the Hubbert model. There are different models or tools to estimate future oil production rates, but the reason that the Hubbert model was chosen for this study is its simplicity and data availability. As any forecast, this study depends heavily on past trends but also factors in the current conditions. It is safe to say that this forecast (study) is as any other forecast, in which it will probably not mirror exactly what will happen in the future. Still, forecasts have to be done, especially for such an important commodity. This study predicts that the total oil to be recovered is 4. 1 trillion barrels. It also shows that most major oil-producing countries are either passed or about to pass their peaks...|$|E
40|$|The Green Revolution {{has had a}} {{tremendous}} positive effect on food security in the developing world. Increased use of modern varieties of wheat has helped belie the conventional wisdom of the 1970 s {{that the world was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> food. But IFPRI projections indicate that global demand for wheat will rise by 40 percent by 2020, and the resources available for wheat production will significantly diminish. For {{the first time since the}} beginning of the Green Revolution, there are serious concerns about future wheat supply. In meeting projected demand, researchers and policymakers must recognize that global food markets are becoming increasingly integrated, agricultural resources devoted to crop production are being diverted, and research systems are facing declining budgets. Given the steady rise in wheat demand due to population and income growth, wheat productivity growth over the next two decades must at least match the rate observed over the past three decades if the increased wheat demand projected by IFPRI is to be met. These production increases must come from favorable, as well as marginal, production environments. In high-potential and irrigated environments, shifting the yield frontier while improving input use efficiency are the priorities for research. In the case of marginal environments, improved tolerance to physical stresses will continue to be the priority. Innovations in crop and resource management will be important from the viewpoint of productivity and sustainability in both the high-potential and low-potential environments. Continued success in wheat germplasm and technology dissemination worldwide depends on the free and uninhibited flow of genetic materials and information. Restrictions imposed on such movement due to intellectual property protection could have serious consequences on the ability of developing countries to sustain wheat productivity growth.

50|$|At {{the start}} of the year Limerick were given little chance of success by most of the pundits and commentators. The last time the team won a game in the provincial {{championship}} was 2001 and few gave them any chance against Tipperray, their opponents in the Munster semi-final. 26,000 people witnessed that game with Tipp looking the likely winners. A goal from substitute Pat Tobin brought Limerick level to 1-19 late on to send the game to a replay. Early in the second half of the replay it looked as if Tipperary were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the easy winners when they led by ten points. Limerick fought back to level the game by the final whistle. A period of extra time was played, however, after 160-minutes of hurling the sides couldn't be separated. Result: Tipperary 2-12 - Limerick 1-24. Eight days later both sides met for the third time. Remarkably, after the seventy minutes had been played both sides were still level and another period of extra time had to be played. After a three-game saga watched by over 80,000 people Limerick claimed their first victory in the provincial championship in six years when they won by 0-22 to 2-13. The reward for this victory was a Munster final meeting with Waterford. It was their first appearance in the provincial decider since 2001 and the first Limerick-Waterford Munster final since 1934. The game saw Waterford's Dan Shanahan run riot and capture three goals as Limerick were well beaten by 3-17 to 1-14. In spite of this Limerick still qualified for the All-Ireland quarter-final where they were drawn to play their near-neighbours Clare. Limerick were the favourites going into the game in spite of having lost quarter-finals in 2001, 2005 and 2006. The favourites tag was well justified and they won more comfortably than the 1-23 to 1-16 score line suggests. This win set up a rematch with Waterford in the All-Ireland semi-final. Having lost the Munster final to them, Waterford were the red-hot favourites going into the game. In spite of their underdog status Limerick produced an incredible display of goalpoaching to defeat Waterford by 5-11 to 2-15 in a thrilling All-Ireland semi-final. It was heart-breaking for Waterford who had to suffer a fourth defeat at the penultimate stage of the championship inside nine years.|$|R
25|$|Obstructing {{the field}} {{is one of the}} nine methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. It {{dictates}} that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. It is governed by Law 37 of the laws of cricket, and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: in the history of cricket, there have been only one instance in Test matches, six occasions in One Day International (ODI) games, and only one instance in Twenty20 International matches. However, there have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball, a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field. In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>run</b> <b>out</b> and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate, so a batsman will not be out any the contact with the ball is inadvertent.|$|R
