40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments, which investigated the performances of the underfloor ventilation systems in thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects. Both the <b>floor</b> <b>return</b> (FR) and the top return (TR) types were tested. An additional set of experiments were conducted on the traditional ceiling-based system for comparison. Results reveal that the underfloor systems created significant overcooling in the nearby area of the floor supply terminals and temperature stratifications in the room. The underfloor systems achieved some level of improvements in ventilation performance. The FR system exhibited a more localized ventilation characteristic {{than that of the}} TR system. With the support from the experimental results, some design considerations were suggested for the underfloor ventilation systems...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, many asset/fund {{managers}} proposed different absolute return strategies {{to gain a}} positive return in any financial market condition. These kind of financial products were created without a comparison benchmark, but only with a <b>floor</b> <b>return</b> given by Euribor. The Euribor plus products became very popular during the period 2000 / 2007 but few of them were able to obtain good returns during the following years 2008 / 2011. The main problem was {{that no one had}} a methodology for tracking the target return they described in the prospectus. In this study we propose a new absolute return strategy based on a quantitative methodology which exploit a risk-adjusted performance indicator (Diaman Ratio) and the logic of Konno and Yamazaki model in order to offer, at the risk-averse investor, a tool that allow him to get a target return in a defined time period whichever will be the beginning of the investment horizon.

40|$|Airflow and {{temperature}} distributions {{in an enclosure}} with heat sources ventilated by floor supply jets with floor or ceiling air exit vents were investigated using experimental and numerical approaches. These ventilation configurations represent the <b>floor</b> <b>return</b> or the top return under floor ventilation systems found in real applications. Experiments and numerical simulations were performed on a full-sized environmental chamber. The results reveal that the temperature strati. cation in the enclosure highly depended on the thermal length scale of the floor supply jets. When the thermal length scale of the supply jet was >> 1, temperature stratification was minor for all tested heat densities and air distribution methods. Significant vertical temperature gradients occurred when the jet thermal length scale was << 1. Changes in air distribution methods also became significant for temperature strati. cation at small supply jet thermal length scales. Temperature stratification also affected the terminal height of the momentum-dominant region of the vertical buoyant supply jets. The applicability of these results to underfloor ventilation design was also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{changes in}} {{arrangement}} in office {{space and the}} huge amount of cables {{brought about by the}} extensive use of computers make the implementation of raised flooring a necessity in modern office buildings. Underfloor ventilation systems that make use of the underfloor plenum for conditioned air distribution will therefore increase in popularity as they extend the flexibility of building services and take advantage of the raised floor to accommodate the HVAC system. Previous research has revealed that the top return type underfloor system saves a significant amount of energy, as the supply air temperature can be higher than that in a ceiling-based system. However, thermal discomfort due to temperature non-uniformity was also reported. This paper presents the experiment results of a laboratory study of the thermal performance for a <b>floor</b> <b>return</b> (FR) type underfloor system under different heat load densities and supply air temperatures. Vertical temperature differences and air velocities were found to be within the comfort limits stated in major international standards. The measured predicted mean vote and predicted percentage of dissatisfied values also satisfied the ISO Standard 7730. A comfortable environment was maintained by the FR type system under a dense internal heat load and with the supply air temperature set at as high as 18 degreesC. Copyright © 2002 S.

40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{characteristic}} and operation of portfolio insurance strategies, this paper applies the principle of Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) and Time-Invariant Portfolio Protection (TIPP) replication to the Taiwan Stock Market. For each strategy, some measures (average return, standard deviation and opportunity cost) are calculated to compare its performance, and focuses on the impacts of controllable factors, such as <b>floor</b> <b>return,</b> protection horizon and portfolio risk multiplier(M) on the performance {{and the cost of}} portfolio insurance, which can be measured by the reduction of long-run arithmetic or geometric average return and the loss of upside captures. Besides, these strategies are compared in different market situations (Taiwan Stock Market from 1988 to 2007) taking into transaction costs and risk-free interest. The results of historical simulations indicate that the performance of implementing portfolio insurance in the Taiwan Stock market can excess return relative to the buy-and-hold (uninsured) strategy if the time horizon of portfolio insurance is one year. However, it's always has some loss of upside captures (opportunity cost) for each strategy. 本研究旨在探討運用投資組合保險策略於投資組合的資產配置時，長期投資組合保險之績效與成本，運用固定比例投資組合保險(Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance，CPPI) 與時間不變性投資組合保險(Time-Invariant Portfolio Protection，TIPP) 兩種投資組合保險策略，以台灣證交所發行量加權股價指數過去二十年(1988 ~ 2007) 的歷史資料為風險性資產標的，來探討兩種策略在不同變數設定下，對執行動態投資組合保險績效與成本的影響。至於投資組合保險的績效與成本的衡量準則係以長期算術(或幾何) 平均報酬率的表現與上方獲利率的損失等準則來衡量。 實證結果顯示，在台灣股市考慮交易成本與投保期間為一年的假設下，採用固定比例策略投資組合保險策略(CPPI) ，或時間不變性投資組合保險策略(TIPP) 配合適當的變數設定操作下，長期平均報酬不僅確能達到保險的效果，相對於買進持有策略(Buy and Hold) 甚至還有超額報酬。另外就投資組合價值的高低變異性來說，TIPP策略相對於CPPI策略具有較低的報酬標準差，可以保障投資人資產價值的波動風險，同時TIPP策略也要承受較大的資產增值的機會成本。整體而言，透過適當的變數設定(可控制因素) ，採用投資組合保險策略之投資報酬率較為穩定，就保險的意義與功能來說，運用長期、持續與紀律性的投資組合保險策略而無須猜測市場的多空走勢，即能獲致保障與獲利的效果，顯然是較適合穩健投資者的資產配置策略。第一章 緒論…………………………………………………… 1 第一節 研究動機…………………………………………………………… 1 第二節 研究目的………………………………………………… 1 第三節 研究流程與架構………………………………………… 2 第二章 文獻探討與回顧………………………………………… 4 第一節 投資組合保險策略之意義………………………………… 4 第二節 投資組合保險策略類型與比較……………………… 5 第三節 投資組合保險策略的限制與成本…………………………… 14 第四節 文獻回顧…………………………………………………… 17 第三章 研究方法…………………………………………………… 19 第一節 研究假設與限制……………………………………… 19 第二節 建立績效與成本的評估準則…………………………… 20 第三節 實證流程、方法與步驟………………………………………… 21 第四章 實證結果與分析……………………………………………………… 26 第一節 不同要保額度對投資組合保險成本之影響………………… 26 第二節 不同風險乘數對投資組合保險成本之影響………………… 34 第二節 不同調整門檻對投資組合保險績效之影響………………………… 35 第五章 結論與建議………………………………………………… 40 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………… 41 中文部份……………………………………………………… 41 英文部份……………………………………………………… 4...|$|E
40|$|Portfolio Insurance is {{the name}} given {{to a wide variety}} of asset {{allocation}} strategies used to control investment risk in portfolios of various asset classes. Portfolio insurance provides downside protection without limiting the potential for upside gains. The success of domestic portfolio insurance strategies, however, may not indicate its benefits in international asset management. Foreign financial markets have different market structures which may not be suitable for the implementation of portfolio insurance strategies. This study, therefore, has attempted to establish the facts about the market structures, to discover the differences among the markets, and to analyze the effects of different market structures on the implementation and the costs of portfolio insurance. ^ Market volatility and futures mispricing that crucially affect the implementation and performance of the international portfolio insurance programs are examined. The costs of two option based portfolio insurance strategies (put-protected and dynamic hedging) as well as a non-option based strategy (Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance) have been assessed and analyzed under historical and simulated market conditions. The impact of the strategic decisions (e. g., the protection horizon, the <b>floor</b> <b>return,</b> and the rebalance interval) on the costs of alternative strategies is also analyzed. ^ The empirical results show that although the Japanese and Hong Kong markets have been more volatile than the U. S. and the futures mispricing more persistent, the costs of alternative portfolio insurance strategies were not prohibitive for the periods tested. Generally, the cost of the 3 -year program was less than that of the 1 -year program. Moreover, for the long-run simulations the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance strategy outperformed the market for the periods examined. ...|$|E
