40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, a vast {{research}} is going on, to study the optical properties of the nano particles i. e., metal and semiconductors thoroughly. Till date most of the optical studies are based on single particle measurement of a quantum dot (QD) or a chromophore {{under the influence of}} an external plasmonic field stimulus. In this the-sis, we tried to address the energy transfer at non local level on a layer of compact, monolayer QD assemblies over micro meter range. The energy transfer occurs in the presence of external field of metal particles or nanorods leads to the enhancement or quenching the emission from a layer of QDs. Chapter 1 is introduction to the basic theoretical aspects of excitons in semiconductor (QDs) and its optical properties under strong confinement regime. The discussion is followed with the optical properties of gold nanoparticles and rods, describing size and shape dependent variation of absorption properties, based on Mie and Mie-Gans theory. Theoretical background of collective effects in QD assemblies based on exciton-plasmonic interactions at single particle level as well as polarization based plasmo-nenhanced fluorescence has been subjected. Experimental techniques are explained in chapter 2 which contains the details of the synthesis of polymer capped nanoparticles with the respective characterization. A discussion on the synthesis methods for cadmium selenide QDs, gold nano particles and the rods with different polymer cap-ping legends and the related capping exchange methods.

Further the details of surface morphology of the prepared thin films has been studied by different microscopic techniques i. e., atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The details of the PL emission measurements of these hybrid arrays using confocal, Raman and polarization based near field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) modes followed with the life time measurements. In third chapter, the substantial strong coupling and collective emission regime is engineered in the QD monolayer films embedded with tiny gold nano particles keeping the QD density same. Tuning the photoluminescence (PL) of semiconducting QD assemblies using small Au NPs in different ratio, different packing density and extent of spectral overlap between QD photoluminescence and the metal nanoparticle absorbance has been discussed. We provided possible experimental and theoretical evidence for the plasmon-mediated emergence of collective emission and enhanced quantum efficiency in these QD films with the consolidation of multiple emitters and multiple NPs. The quantum efficiency of these hybrid assemblies is further explored with different material as well as the size effect of metal nano particles. Chapter 4 comprises the experiment results of the self-assembled compact and partially aligned gold nano rod (GNR) arrays on QD monolayer films. We experimentally demonstrated the quantum efficiency of these QD hybrid assemblies is gaining max-imum when the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption maxima of GNR arrays is resonant with the QD monolayer PL maxima and is always non-existent for the off resonant case.

There were two simple methods, which were used separately: solvent evaporation and <b>dip</b> <b>coating.</b> Based on titania sol stability test, it was observed that acid condition would be favourable for immobilizing titania unto pumice, and preferable dispersion medium for solvent evaporation method was ethanol, while <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method was better to use aquadest (water). Prepared samples were characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, XRD, and BET analysis. Mechanical strength and photodegradation tests were conducted to observe the quality and ability of immobilized photocatalyst. Experimental results show that both methods had produced mechanically strong immobilized titania, where <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method tended to produce homogen solid film of titania on the outer surface of pumice, while solvent evaporation method could deliver titania deeper unto the inner part of the pumice. Catalyst detachment level of immobilized titania nanotube by <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method was 4.6 %, while the one of the products of solvent evaporation method was 5.0 %. Furthermore, in terms of photocatalytic activity, product of <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> method gave slightly better performance (with 28 % of phenol elimination after 240  min) than the product of solvent evaporation method (24 %), due to shading effect, mostly occurring to immobilized catalyst in the inner part of the pumice.|$|R

This study is motivated by <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> at very low capillary numbers when the deposited film thickness is less than 1 µm and such interaction forces become important. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that {{in the presence of}} an extra body force the solution procedure differs significantly from the classical one and leads to substantial deviations from the Landau-Levich law for the entrained film thickness. In particular, attractive potentials produce film thickening and the resulting film thickness is independent of speed to lowest order. Repulsive potentials bring about more complicated behavior and lead either to films whose thickness is also independent of speed, or to a modification of the leading order constant in the classical Ca^(2 / 3) law. Demonstration of these effects is given for a model potential.
