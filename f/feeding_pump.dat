5000|$|After being {{educated in}} the public schools of his native city, Worthington, who had shown early a decided bent for things mechanical, sought {{employment}} that enabled him to become a hydraulic engineer while still a very young man. He concentrated his attention on the problems of city water supply, became thoroughly familiar with steam engines and mechanical pumps, and engaged in experiments intended to improve these machines. Canal navigation interested him, too, and it was in this connection that he made his first invention. As early as 1840 he had an experimental steam canal boat in operation which was fairly successful except that when the boat was stopped it became necessary to resort to hand pump to keep the steam boiler supplied with water. To overcome this deficiency he invented an independent <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> which was automatic in its action and was controlled by the water level within the steam boiler (patent, September 7, 1840).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{clinically}} relevant {{discrepancies between}} prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of enteral nutrition (EN) {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) patients. Next to EN-protocol violations due to insufficient care, we hypothesized technical factors to be responsible for this deficit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems frequently used in the ICU. METHODS: Thirteen commercially available EN feeding pumps with their own delivery systems were tested in 12 sessions with different EN feeding tubes and EN formulas in a laboratory setting. The reproducibility of the measurements was determined for the 8 best performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. RESULTS: There were clinically important differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes of EN in the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The deficit in volume ranged from + 66 mL (surplus of 66 mL) to - 271 mL (deficit of 271 mL) per 24 hours (14 % of prescribed volume). Viscosity of test fluids (water/EN feeding formulas) and resistance of test tubes had no influence on the delivered volume by the tested EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems, because differences between prescribed volumes and delivered volumes were consistently found for each system while varying these test settings. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between prescribed and delivered EN volumes are caused by the function and construction of EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> systems. To improve nutrition therapy, the flow rate has to be adjusted or the best-performing EN <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> has to be purchase...|$|E
3000|$|Coal-based {{electric}} power generation remains the basic source of obtaining energy. With increasing pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions, improving power unit efficiency has become an issue of utmost significance. Surely, one of the possibilities to improve the efficiency of new power units is raising the steam parameters. With improved power plant efficiency, there is a lower demand for power of almost all auxiliary equipment except the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that the power needed to drive the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> is an almost linear function of the steam pressure. This means that, even though the steam mass flow (and, consequently, the feed water mass flow) is reduced and the efficiency of <b>feed</b> <b>pumps</b> is improved, their power increases.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Feed</b> <b>pumps</b> are an {{essential}} subsystem of boilers used in industrial process plants and called as boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> (BFP). Normally, BFP is high pressure unit that takes suction from condensate return system {{and can be}} of the centrifugal type pump. In centrifugal pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and exits radially. Generally, electric motor is used as prime mover to run the <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b> To force water into boiler, the pump must generate sufficient pressure to overcome steam pressure developed by boiler. In the present study, design and analysis of boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> having a flow of 2000 m 3 /hr, head of 470 m and operating at 130 ± 10 o C has been taken up. The various pump parameters are obtained from design and pump model is developed using modelling software Creo Parametric. To evaluate the results at given operating conditions, CFD analysis is carried out using Ansys CFX module. Blade number has great influence on the pump performance. Therefore, CFD analyses are carried out for the pump with 5, 6 and 7 blades. Based on performance of every pump model, the best <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> design is selected. A steady state CFD analysis is carried out using the K-ε turbulence model to solve for the Navier-Stroke’s equation. Keywords- <b>feed</b> <b>pump,</b> pump design, CFD analysis, pump performance.

40|$|Feeding {{dynamics}} in the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius were analysed {{to determine the}} food source. Evidence from previous reports indicates that this species and similar insects feed from the xylem. However, {{it is not clear}} whether they extract sap from the main transpiration stream, or from some subsidiary compartment of xylem, such as immature or cavitated vessels. In feeding from such subsidiary compartments, the insects could avoid the large hydraulic tensions thought to prevail in xylem on the main transpiration stream. Philaenus, for example, is shown here to initiate feeding, and to feed rapidly, from plants in which the full xylem tension is estimated at − 10 bar. From measurements of feeding rates and feeding patterns in stressed and unstressed plants, it is shown that Philaenus cannot feed from subsidiary xylem compartments. It is concluded that this insect feeds directly from the main transpiration stream, and at the full hydraulic tension which prevails there. The anatomy of the <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> in Philaenus appears consistent with this conclusion.

Moreover, economic, stability and lifetime characteristics are also integrated into the active fault-tolerant MPC. The proposed FDI and FTMPC scheme is tested experimentally in a DMFC test rig with a 5 -cell DMFC stack to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed approach.

Performances and main geometrical characteristic trends, such as plant height Z and two-phase column diameter DT–PD have been drawn, varying the minimum cycle temperature between 15 and 25 8 C and the user temperature, Tmax; in the range 60 – 70 8 C.

40|$|Abstract—Recent medical {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the importance of enteral feeding {{and the use of}} feeding pumps for recovering patients unable to feed themselves or gain nourishment and nutrients by natural means. The most of enteral feeding system uses a peristaltic tube pump. A peristaltic pump is a form of positive displacement pump in which a flexible tube is progressively squeezed externally to allow the resulting enclosed pillow of fluid to progress along it. The squeezing of the tube requires a precise and robust controller of the geared motor to overcome parametric uncertainty of the pumping system which generates due to a wide variation of friction and slip between tube and roller. So, this paper proposes fuzzy adaptive controller for the robust control of the peristaltic tube pump. This new adaptive controller uses a fuzzy multi-layered architecture which has several independent fuzzy controllers in parallel, each with different robust stability area. Out of several independent fuzzy controllers, the most suited one is selected by a system identifier which observes variations in the controlled system parameter. This paper proposes a design procedure which can be carried out mathematically and systematically from the model of a controlled system. Finally, the good control performance, accurate dose rate and robust system stability, of the developed <b>feeding</b> <b>pump</b> is confirmed through experimental and clinic testing...|$|E

A cross-section of the central "muscular " part of the pump shows only 30 % myofibrillar area {{and there is still}} less contractile tissue towards the anterior and posterior ends of the pump. The pump shortens and widens as the lining is opened and becomes longer and thinner when the lining closes, and swell-ing of the radial muscles normal to their line of action jams them together, providing anchorage for them to open the lining. But some parts of the radial musculature are squeezed outward when active so that the anterior muscles shorten by> 4 %, but the middle and posterior muscles by half this or not at all. When the sclerotised pump lining opens from triradiate to triangular cross-section, equatorial and polar radii increase and decrease by about 15 %; similar values were ob-tained with a manipulated scale model. The lining opening involves transient distortion into compound curves, but the fully-open (triangular) condition is quite stable and on closing is destabilised by a nearly longitudinal pull from the posterior radial muscles.

In the area of supply and distribution of starting material the perforations of the rotor have a slit shape.

It was later shown that the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|R
30|$|Under a {{low load}} of the unit, the steam mass {{flow through the}} {{low-pressure}} turbine is usually not big enough which causes the danger of {{a substantial increase in}} the temperature of the blades. As a rule, the problem is solved by increasing the steam mass flow from the intermediate- to the low-pressure turbine. Under low loads of the unit, there may then be not enough steam fed into the turbine driving the <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> which necessitates an introduction of additional steam into it. This may cause mechanical problems because the turbine driving the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump</b> was designed for lower parameters of the incoming steam. In consequence, additional facilities are required for the system, which increase the investment costs of the plant. Another option in this situation is a transition to an electric drive of the boiler <b>feed</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
