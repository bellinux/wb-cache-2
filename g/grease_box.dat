50|$|According to Phat Beets Produce {{the problem}} is that <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> is not just a threat to them, but it is a threat to the {{community}} overall. Phat Beets Produce has complained that many of the vendors in the Kitchen Incubator program {{have not been able to}} use the kitchen because of Grease Box’s owner’s Lizzy’s demand for a gluten free kitchen and health permits only allowing <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> employees to use the kitchen. Other vendors such as the one owned by Naimah Matthews have been displaced and were forced to pack their stuff and leave once <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> moved in, even though they had been cooking and selling food out of the cafe before <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> had even arrived.http://www.eastbayexpress.com/WhatTheFork/archives/2013/08/27/grease-box-phat-beets-and-the-g-word Phat Beets thinks this is also problematic for the community because historic residents are now being forced to move because their housing costs and property values are rising with new residents and businesses like <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> moving in. This has caused Phat Beets to spend their time, money, and resources to fight displacement instead of focusing on their food justice programs.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{challenges}} has been displacement by other organizations. The once abandoned North Oakland building was supposed to open a healthy foods cafe to provide access to fresh food options to a community who otherwise did not have access to it. Phat Beets had also just opened up a Kitchen Incubator program that allowed low income Oakland residents to open up their own food business at a low price. However, when a new tenant arrived in 2013, <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> (A gluten free restaurant) things became problematic for the program. What {{was supposed to be a}} harmonious relationship, with Phat Beets Produce’s farmers market operating in the parking lot turned out to be very problematic according to Phat Beets. Just months after <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> moved into the building Phat Beets accused the owner of displacing not only its own programs but also low income Oakland residents in the process of gentrification. In a statement describing the situation Phat Beets commented that <b>Grease</b> <b>Box</b> is “part of the ongoing process of gentrification where historic Oakland residents lose houses, jobs, and opportunities to newer, wealthier incoming residents with greater access to resources.” According to Phat Beets, for these reasons, GreaseBox has shut down the Kitchen Incubator Program and has forced them to move locations to the Arlington Health Center.|$|E
40|$|The wide {{spread of}} food outlets {{has become an}} {{environmental}} and sanitation infrastructure problem, due to Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG). A <b>grease</b> <b>box</b> is used at the industrials facilities to collect the FOG, in a specific time window, while its quality is good for recycling (e. g., biodiesel) and it is economically valuable. After this period, it will be disposed at a cost. For the proper management of the grease boxes, {{it is necessary to}} know the quantity of FOG inside the boxes, which is a major problem, as the boxes are sealed and permanently filled with water. The lack of homogeneity of the FOG renders it not detectable by current probes for level detection in liquids. In this article, the design, development and testing of a set of probes for FOG level measurement, based on the principles used in sensors for the detection of liquids inside containers, is described. The most suitable probe, based on the capacitance principle, together with the necessary hardware and software modules for data acquisition and transmission, was developed and tested. After the development phase, the probe was integrated on a metropolitan system for FOG collection and <b>grease</b> <b>box</b> management in partnership with a <b>grease</b> <b>box</b> management company...|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 41). This report describes a comparative study of consumer preference towards ACI Power Tiller of Bangladesh. Here we have used judgmental sampling under non-probability sampling method. Before data collection, the customers of ACI Power Tiller were divided into three groups: farmers, mechanics and dealers. Then, among those, we have selected the customers thoughtfully to get response. We have taken total thirty samples from all over ACI business territories. We have conducted our survey in between October 2012 to December 2012. In the analysis part of our research, we have interpreted several variables, which helped us to get a clear picture regarding consumer attitude towards ACI Power Tiller. Here, we have found that, some factors like age, years of experience, expert reference etc. influence significantly while purchasing power tiller. Besides, we also found, there are some factors like grade of Mobil, use of <b>grease</b> in gear <b>box,</b> usage directory etc we think important but not actually influence the purchasing effort of a consumer. The managerial decisions in the organization can be taken by focusing less on these issues. At the end, after analyzing the statistical data, we came into a conclusion, which describes the ultimate result of our research. The result of our research is ACI should introduce their new premium quality power tiller in market as there is demand for quality machines among consumers of power tiller.

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle <b>box</b> <b>grease</b> is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
