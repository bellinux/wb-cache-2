30|$|We {{investigate}} the detailed distribution of hypocenters and focal mechanisms beneath the Tanzawa Mountains, central Japan, where the Izu-Bonin arc has collided {{into the central}} part of the Honshu arc. Remarkable differences are found to exist between <b>the</b> hypocenter distributions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western and <b>eastern</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>The</b> hypocenters of earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> tend to be distributed in a horizontal zone, whereas those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part are distributed <b>in</b> a volume. <b>The</b> focal mechanisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> are right-lateral reverse faulting mechanisms, and one of the nodal planes is consistent with the geometry of the Philippine Sea (PHS) plate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. These results suggest that most earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> occur along <b>the</b> upper surface of the subducting PHS plate. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> focal mechanisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part, especially deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part, exhibit a different feature. <b>The</b> stress states <b>in</b> these two regions are found to be significantly different. The maximum and minimum principal stress axes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> are slightly inclined, whereas those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part are oriented <b>in</b> approximately <b>the</b> vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. <b>The</b> stress field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> may be caused by a slab pull force induced from the deeper part of the subducted plate.|$|R

30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} hypocenters, focal mechanisms, and stress states beneath the Tanzawa Mountains located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Izu-Honshu collision zone. We found that characteristics of the hypocenter distribution and focal mechanisms clearly differ between <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> and western <b>parts</b> of the Tanzawa region. The hypocenters of <b>the</b> earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> tend to be distributed within a horizontal zone, whereas the hypocenters of <b>the</b> earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part are distributed <b>in</b> a volume. <b>The</b> focal mechanisms of the right-lateral reverse fault representative <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> par {{are consistent with the}} configuration of the upper surface of the PHS plate. <b>The</b> focal mechanisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> differ from those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part. Most of <b>the</b> earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> beneath <b>the</b> Tanzawa region are considered to occur along the upper surface of the subducting PHS plate, whereas those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part occur within the PHS plate. <b>The</b> stress state <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> is significantly different from that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part. The plunges of the σ 1 and σ 3 axes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> are slightly inclined. The stress state may be induced by a pull force caused by the deeper part of the subducting slab.|$|R

Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E
5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH.

The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, which they had liberated {{in the autumn of}} 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and {{due to the lack of}} other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E

5|$|Kingston Road was {{formerly}} Ontario Highway 2, {{and was the}} main highway through Scarborough until {{the building of the}} Highway 401, which runs east-west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction.

In the 1960s, Metropolitan Toronto planned to build a second east-west highway across Scarborough. It was intended to link Highway 2A with an eastern extension of the Gardiner Expressway. The highway, known as the Scarborough Expressway, was cancelled due to public opposition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{changes were}} {{occurring}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Jefferson County. The portion of highway from Ryan {{east to the}} Love County line {{was removed from the}} highway system on December 31, 1937. As a result, SH-32 was discontiguous; one section stretched from Davidson to Ryan, while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson–Love county line and continued east from there. The portion of SH-32 concurrent with US-81 between Waurika and Ryan, once necessary to connect to the now-decommissioned road, was removed on February 24, 1938. Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH-32 on February 29, 1944.|$|E

It is true that both gradually came to occupy and farm a broad area around their initial bridgeheads (in the case of Luanda, mostly along the lower Kwanza River). However, their main function was trade – overwhelmingly the slave trade. Slaves were bought from African intermediaries and sold to Brazil and the Caribbean.
