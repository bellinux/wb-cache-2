5|$|Periodontitis, a {{bacterial}} disease affecting the jaws, is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats; the animal {{has been proposed}} {{as a model for}} research on the disease in humans. The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown. Vitamin E, fluoride, and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis. A case of <b>kyphosis</b> has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.|$|E

25|$|A {{whiplash}} injury from {{an automobile}} accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver {{studies have shown that}} as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the <b>kyphosis</b> of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a <b>kyphosis</b> while the upper cervical spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.|$|E
25|$|Vertebral fractures, {{while having}} a smaller impact on mortality, {{can lead to}} a severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, {{multiple}} vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back (<b>kyphosis),</b> the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar <b>kyphosis</b> and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|When {{scoliosis}} is suspected, weight-bearing full-spine AP/coronal (front-back view) and lateral/sagittal (side view) X-rays {{are usually}} taken {{to assess the}} scoliosis curves and the <b>kyphosis</b> and lordosis, as these can also be affected in individuals with scoliosis. Full-length standing spine X-rays are the standard method for evaluating the severity and progression of the scoliosis, and whether it is congenital or idiopathic in nature. In growing individuals, serial radiographs are obtained at three- to 12-month intervals to follow curve progression, and, in some instances, MRI investigation is warranted {{to look at the}} spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|The main {{radiographic}} {{features of}} generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several {{methods such as}} height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to <b>kyphosis</b> of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination records and establishes the accurate {{measures of the}} woman's body mass index, vital signs, the mass of each breast, the degree of inframammary intertrigo present, the degree of breast ptosis, the degree of enlargement of each breast, lesions to the skin envelope, the degree of sensation in the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and discharges from the nipple. Also noted are the secondary effects of the enlarged breasts, such as shoulder-notching by the brassière strap from the breast weight, <b>kyphosis</b> (excessive, backwards curvature of the thoracic region of the spinal column), skin irritation, and skin rash affecting the breast crease (IMF).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Kyphosis</b> is {{an exaggerated}} kyphotic (concave) {{curvature}} in the thoracic region, also called hyperkyphosis. This produces the so-called [...] "humpback" [...] or [...] "dowager's hump", a condition commonly resulting from osteoporosis.|$|E
2500|$|People with Parkinson's disease have {{a higher}} risk of broken bones. This is related to poor balance and poor bone density. In Parkinson’s [...] disease there may be a link between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and altered calcium {{metabolism}} (and iron metabolism) causing a stiffening of the skeleton and <b>kyphosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The only {{contemporary}} {{reference to}} Richard having any deformities was {{the observation that}} his right shoulder was slightly higher than his left, which is now {{known to have been}} caused by his scoliosis of the spine. It has been suggested that this scoliosis was discovered by his enemies only after his death. [...] After the discovery of Richard's remains in 2012, it became clear that he had no deformities other than this scoliosis; the degree and direction of the curvature was not as serious as that of a spinal <b>kyphosis</b> (or [...] "hunchback").|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservative}} groupings {{were especially}} critical of Pantazi Ghica's politics. Iacob Negruzzi, who eventually rallied with the Junimists, resented Rosetti's radical circle, and left an unflattering memoir of its meetings. Several other writers who associated with Junimea attacked {{the two brothers}} Ghica for their alleged corruption and demagogy. In Mihai Eminescu's lengthy poem Scrisoarea a III-a, an entire section elaborates a virulent anti-liberal discourse. Of it, a group of lyrics are believed to refer to Pantazi Ghica (identified by his appearance and his <b>kyphosis)</b> or, alternatively, to a composite portrayal of the two brothers. They read: ...|$|E
2500|$|Cecily Neville as the Duchess of York is a {{principal}} character in Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of King Richard III. She is portrayed as having deep affection for her dead sons George and Edward, but is cold and unloving to Richard, to whom she refers as a [...] "false glass that grieves me when I see my shame in him." [...] Because Richard is depicted as a hunchback – he suffered from scoliosis, not <b>kyphosis</b> – the Duchess seems to hate him for his deformity and for his difficult birth, which several characters in the play gossip about. After Richard has done away with The Princes in the Tower, his mother turns against him completely, cursing him with the damning words: [...] "Bloody thou art, Bloody will be thy end!" [...] She has been portrayed by many noted actresses, including Elinor Aickin, Eleanor Bron, Annette Crosbie (for BBC Shakespeare in 1983), Helen Haye (in Laurence Olivier's 1955 film), Anne Jeffreys, and, in the 1995 film starring Ian McKellen, Dame Maggie Smith. In this last version, her character was given several scenes belonging to Margaret of Anjou in the actual play. In the 1955 Olivier film, her role was reduced {{to little more than}} a bit part.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kyphosis</b> {{by itself}} is of several types, {{including}} postural <b>kyphosis</b> caused by slouching. Such forms of <b>kyphosis</b> can be reversed {{to a certain extent}} by correcting muscular imbalances. The more debilitating version of <b>kyphosis</b> is Scheuermann’s <b>kyphosis,</b> found mostly in teenagers. There are few other causes of <b>Kyphosis</b> as well, such as congenital, nutritional or osteoporosis induced and post-traumatic.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of <b>kyphosis</b> is generally made through observation and measurement. Idiopathic causes, such as vertebral wedging or other abnormalities, {{can be confirmed}} through X-ray. Osteoporosis, a potential cause of <b>kyphosis,</b> can be confirmed with a bone density scan. Postural thoracic <b>kyphosis</b> can often be treated with posture reeducation and focused strengthening exercises. Idiopathic thoracic <b>kyphosis</b> due to vertebral wedging, fractures, or vertebral abnormalities {{is more difficult to}} manage, since assuming a correct posture may not be possible with structural changes in the vertebrae. Children who have not completed their growth may show long-lasting improvements with bracing. Exercises may be prescribed to alleviate discomfort associated with overstretched back muscles. A variety of gravity-assisted positions or gentle traction can minimize pain associated with nerve root impingement. Surgery may be recommended for severe idiopathic <b>kyphosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Causes:1) Anterior pelvic tilt {{is caused}} by {{increased}} lumbar lordosis and thoracic <b>kyphosis,</b> stretched abdominal muscles, tightened hip flexors.2) Posterior pelvic tilt {{is caused by}} sway back and thoracic <b>kyphosis,</b> stretched flexors and lower abdominal muscles and tightened hamstrings.|$|E
5000|$|Scheuermann's <b>kyphosis</b> (M42.0) is {{significantly}} worse cosmetically {{and can cause}} varying degrees of pain, and can also affect {{different areas of the}} spine (the most common being the midthoracic area). Scheuermann's <b>kyphosis</b> is considered a form of juvenile osteochondrosis of the spine, and is more commonly called Scheuermann's disease. It is found mostly in teenagers and presents a significantly worse deformity than postural <b>kyphosis.</b> A patient suffering from Scheuermann’s <b>kyphosis</b> cannot consciously correct posture. The apex of the curve, located in the thoracic vertebrae, is quite rigid. The patient may feel pain at this apex, which can be aggravated by physical activity and by long periods of standing or sitting. This can have a significantly detrimental effect on their lives, as their level of activity is curbed by their condition; they may feel isolated or uneasy amongst peers if they are children, depending on the level of deformity. Whereas in postural <b>kyphosis,</b> the vertebrae and discs appear normal, in Scheuermann’s <b>kyphosis,</b> they are irregular, often herniated, and wedge-shaped over at least three adjacent levels. Fatigue is a very common symptom, most likely because of the intense muscle work that has to be put into standing and/or sitting properly. The condition appears to run in families. Most patients who undergo surgery to correct their <b>kyphosis</b> have Scheuermann's disease.|$|E

However, the decision to carry out the procedure can be very difficult due to the potential risks to the child. A congenital <b>kyphosis</b> can also suddenly appear in teenage years, more commonly in children with cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders.|$|E

50|$|To keep {{balance with}} {{posterior}} tilt, the spine is rounded with the rectus abdominis shortened and the erector spinae lengthened. This leads to lumbar <b>kyphosis.</b> <b>Kyphosis</b> {{does not always}} occur in tandem with posterior tilt, when the weight is born in other ways, such as on the hands, which can allow a posteriorly tilted pelvis with a neutral or even lordotic spine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kyphosis</b> (from Greek κυφός kyphos, a hump) is an {{abnormally}} excessive convex kyphotic {{curvature of}} the spine as it occurs in the cervical, thoracic and sacral regions. (Abnormal inward concave lordotic curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis.) <b>Kyphosis</b> can be called roundback or Kelso's hunchback. It can result from degenerative diseases such as arthritis; developmental problems, most commonly Scheuermann's disease; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; multiple myeloma or trauma. A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st to the 12th vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20° to 45°. When the [...] "roundness" [...] of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called <b>kyphosis</b> or [...] "hyperkyphosis". Scheuermann's <b>kyphosis</b> is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and {{is the result of}} wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females.|$|E
