25|$|When molten, {{the salt}} sodium {{chloride}} can be electrolyzed to yield metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine. Industrially this process {{takes place in}} a special cell named Down's cell. The cell is connected to an electrical power supply, allowing electrons to migrate from the power supply to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many {{types of}} {{electrochemical}} cells have been produced, with varying chemical processes and designs, including galvanic <b>cells,</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cells,</b> fuel cells, flow cells and voltaic piles.|$|R
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} redox {{reactions of}} a conventional battery produce electricity through the different chemical potentials of the cathode and anode in the electrolyte. However, electrolysis requires an external source of electrical energy to induce a chemical reaction, and this process {{takes place in a}} compartment called an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
25|$|Faraday {{concluded}} {{after several}} experiments on electric current in non-spontaneous process, {{the mass of}} the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell, the length of time the current existed, and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. In other words, the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell.|$|E
25|$|Some metals, such as nickel do not electrolyze out {{but remain}} in the {{electrolyte}} solution. These are then reduced by chemical reactions to refine the metal. Other metals, which during the processing of the target metal have been reduced but not deposited at the cathode, sink {{to the bottom of}} the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell,</b> where they form a substance referred to as anode sludge or anode slime. The metals in this sludge can be removed by standard pyrorefining methods.|$|E

25|$|Water can be {{converted}} to its component elemental gasses, H2 and O2 through the application of an external voltage. Water doesn't decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneously as the Gibbs free energy for the process at standard conditions is about 474.4 kJ. The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell.</b> In it, a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid (most used 0.1 M).|$|E
25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E
2500|$|Unable {{to produce}} excess heat or neutrons, and with {{positive}} experiments being plagued by errors and giving disparate results, most researchers declared that heat production {{was not a}} real effect and ceased working on the experiments. In 1993, after their original report, Fleischmann reported [...] "heat-after-death" [...] experiments—where excess heat was measured after the electric current supplied to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> was turned off. This type of report has also become part of subsequent cold fusion claims.|$|E
25|$|Cathode: The {{electrode}} {{at which}} reduction (a gain of electrons) occurs. For fuel cells and other galvanic cells, the cathode is the positive terminal; for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cells</b> (where electrolysis occurs), the cathode is the negative terminal.|$|R
40|$|Deuterium {{loading of}} {{palladium}} cathodes in Pons-Fleischmann type <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cells</b> {{has been observed}} to result in generation of excess heat on several occasions.

Initiation and sustaining these heat bursts, monitoring of nuclear products and materials aspects of these <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cells</b> have been the focus of our current efforts. As D/Pd loading appear to be critical, the measurement of deuterium loading using dilatometry as a function of current density, surface and heat treatment of the cathode and poisoning are currently being investigated...|$|R

2500|$|Sodium carbonate, in a {{solution}} with common salt, {{may be used for}} [...] cleaning silver. In a nonreactive container (glass, plastic, or ceramic), aluminium foil and the silver object are immersed in the hot salt solution. The elevated pH dissolves the aluminium oxide layer on the foil and enables an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> to be established. Hydrogen ions produced by this reaction reduce the sulfide ions on the silver restoring silver metal. The sulfide can be released as small amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Rinsing and gently polishing the silver restores a highly polished condition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927 Swedish {{scientist}} John Tandberg {{reported that}} he had fused hydrogen into helium in an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> with palladium electrodes. On the basis of his work, he applied for a Swedish patent for [...] "a method to produce helium and useful reaction energy". Due to Paneth and Peters's retraction and his inability to explain the physical process, his patent application was denied. After deuterium was discovered in 1932, Tandberg continued his experiments with heavy water. The final experiments made by Tandberg with heavy water were similar to the original experiment by Fleischmann and Pons. Fleischmann and Pons were not aware of Tandberg's work.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{electroplating}} step, nickel, copper, or gold is plated upward {{from the}} metalized substrate into the voids {{left by the}} removed photoresist. Taking place in an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell,</b> the current density, temperature, and solution are carefully controlled to ensure proper plating. [...] In the case of nickel deposition from NiCl2 in a KCl solution, Ni is deposited on the cathode (metalized substrate) and Cl2 evolves at the anode. [...] Difficulties associated with plating into PMMA molds include voids, where hydrogen bubbles nucleate on contaminates; chemical incompatibility, where the plating solution attacks the photoresist; and mechanical incompatibility, where film stress causes the plated layer to lose adhesion. [...] These difficulties can be overcome through the empirical optimization of the plating chemistry and environment for a given layout.|$|E

50|$|Consider two voltaic {{cells of}} unequal voltage. Mark the {{positive}} and negative electrodes of each one as P and N, respectively. Place them in a circuit with P near P and N near N, so the cells will tend to drive current in opposite directions. The cell with the larger voltage is discharged, making it a galvanic cell, so P is the cathode and N is the anode as described above. But, the cell with the smaller voltage charges, making it an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell.</b> In the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell,</b> negative ions are driven towards P and positive ions towards N. Thus, the P electrode of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> meets the definition of anode while the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> is being charged. Similarly, the N electrode of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> is the cathode while the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cell</b> is being charged.|$|E

Two non-membrane <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cells</b> were constructed for electrochemical generation volatile species. These cells differ in the volume of electrode chamber. An atomic absorption spectrometry with quartz tube atomizer was used in most experiments. The equipment was performed in flow continuous mode.
