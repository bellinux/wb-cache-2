40|$|We {{say that}} a finite {{asynchronous}} cellular automaton (or more generally, any sequential dynamical system) is pi-independent if its set of periodic points are independent of the order that the local functions are applied. In this case, the local functions permute the periodic points, and these permutations generate the <b>dynamics</b> <b>group.</b> We have previously shown that exactly 104 of the possible 256 cellular automaton rules are pi-independent. In this article, we classify the periodic states of these systems and describe their <b>dynamics</b> <b>groups,</b> which are quotients of Coxeter <b>groups.</b> The <b>dynamics</b> <b>groups</b> provide information about permissible dynamics {{as a function of}} update sequence and, as such, connect discrete dynamical systems, group theory, and algebraic combinatorics in a new and interesting way. We conclude with a discussion of numerous open problems and directions for future research. Comment: Revised per referee's comment...|$|R

25|$|Wilfred Bion's {{observations}} {{about the role}} of group processes in <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> are set out in Experiences in Groups and other papers, written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues that in every group, two groups are actually present: the work group, and the basic assumption group. The work group is that aspect of group functioning which {{has to do with the}} primary task of the group—what the group has formed to accomplish; will 'keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour'. The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: dependency, fight-flight, and pairing. When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.|$|E

25|$|Coalitional {{psychology}} is {{an approach to}} explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the conditionality of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status.

25|$|While {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change {{the behavior of}} cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its microenvironment. Thus, the process of carcinogenesis is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, {{in light of the}} Darwinistic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertarial and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically inclined toward supportive <b>group</b> <b>dynamics,</b> and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulative <b>group</b> <b>dynamics.</b>|$|E

25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|E
25|$|To {{investigate}} {{the salience of}} religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Understanding the {{dynamics}} of network evolution rests {{in part on the}} representation chosen to characterize the evolutionary process. We offer a simple, three-parameter representation based on subgraphs that capture three important properties of social networks: leadership, team alignment or bonding among members, and diversity of expertise. When plotted on this representation, the evolution of a typical small group such as start-ups or street gangs has a spiral trajectory, moving toward a tentative fixed point as membership increases to two dozen or so. We show that a simple probabilistic model for recruitment and bonding can not explain these observations, and suggest that strategic moves among group members may come into play.

Rayado crews are accompanied by two rangers and experience a number of challenges geared toward developing personal growth, a sense of stewardship for the environment, and leadership skills. Rayado participants are challenged physically, mentally, and spiritually as they hike Philmont's most challenging trails, visit parts of the backcountry that are never seen by regular trek participants, and take part in activities that are not available to other Scouts. This includes difficult rock climbing and instruction in outdoor leadership, wilderness problem-solving, and advanced outdoor skills which include wilderness backpacking, navigation and travel, expedition behavior and <b>group</b> <b>dynamics,</b> advanced cooking, wilderness stewardship, and wilderness first aid and backcountry emergency procedures. A Rayado Trek encourages personal growth, teamwork, and leadership ability.|$|E

He worked and camped with the local YMCA throughout his early years, and enjoyed these activities {{to such an extent that}} he intended to work for the YMCA after completing his education. Kinsey's senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the Boy Scouts when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization that was based on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn Eagle Scout in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts. Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychology}} {{is the study}} of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people. Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of <b>group</b> <b>dynamics</b> reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and total institution.|$|E
