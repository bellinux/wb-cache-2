5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; {{it has always been}} the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E
5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|In May 1794, a large French fleet put to sea {{to ensure}} the safety of an American grain convoy and was intercepted <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Atlantic at the Glorious First of June by the British Channel Fleet, the most {{powerful}} of the Royal Navy's fleets and the force assigned to restrict French movements from Brest. The French suffered a serious defeat, losing seven ships, but managed to retire in good order and saved the grain convoy. Later in June 1794 the British Fleet again put to sea, but was caught in a storm and many ships were badly damaged. Its commander Lord Howe retired with his fleet to the anchorage in Torbay and thus there was no British fleet at sea in late October when a powerful French squadron sailed from Brest with the intention of attacking a large merchant convoy sailing from Lisbon to Britain. The force, under the command of Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly, consisted of the 74-gun ships of the line Marat, Tigre, Droits de l'Homme, Pelletier and Jean-Bart with the frigates Charente, Fraternité, Gentille and the corvette Papillon.|$|E

Eventually, Felix's party is able to achieve entrance into a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature: it is the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size {{and parts of the}} world to collapse into the abyss.

25|$|Rain {{had fallen}} for {{considerable}} time overnight, making the pitch difficult, though MacLaren and Palairet cut 36 off the target before lunch was taken. Palairet was then bowled by Saunders, and Tyldesley and MacLaren followed, the latter caught <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{the field by}} Duff for 35. Australia's Saunders then dropped Abel before rain stopped play again. After the break, England's batsmen were instructed to hit out. Abel added 20 with Ranjitsinhji, who looked uncertain against Trumble and was eventually given lbw, and Trumble and Saunders kept at the English batsmen. Abel was bowled trying to drive, Jackson caught at mid off, Braund stumped, and Lockwood bowled, England now requiring 11 to win with two wickets in hand. Rhodes came in and struck a boundary, and Lilley hit two scoring shots to take the tally to 116, before Hill, starting from long on, took a brilliant running catch square in the deep, {{in front of the}} pavilion, to dismiss him when the ball, albeit held up in the wind, had seemed sure to go for four.|$|E
500|$|The term {{trade winds}} {{originally}} {{derives from the}} early fourteenth century late Middle English word 'trade,' meaning [...] "path" [...] or [...] "track." [...] The Portuguese {{recognized the importance of}} the trade winds (then the Volta do mar, meaning in Portuguese [...] "turn of the sea" [...] but also [...] "return from the sea") in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century. [...] From West Africa, the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal, that is, to west and northwest. They could then turn northeast, to the area around the Azores islands, and finally east to mainland Europe. They also learned that to reach South Africa, they needed to go <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the ocean, head for Brazil, and around 30°S go east again. Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Weather is {{not limited}} to {{planetary}} bodies. [...] Like all stars, the sun's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. [...] The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. [...] Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events {{on the surface of the}} star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. [...] Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the solar system as Saturn. [...] The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. [...] The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae, and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals.|$|E

As with other waves, the wave tends to break in shallow places and near the bank, and flow smoothly in deep water. The wave travels upstream against the river current at a speed of 8 to 13 miles per hour.|$|E

2500|$|Solar {{panels on}} {{spacecraft}} {{are usually the}} sole source of power to run the sensors, active heating and cooling, and communications. [...] A battery stores this energy for use when the solar panels are in shadow. [...] In some, the power is also used for spacecraft propulsion—electric propulsion. [...] Spacecraft {{were one of the}} earliest applications of photovoltaics, starting with the silicon solar cells used on the Vanguard 1 satellite, launched by the US in 1958. Since then, solar power has been used on missions ranging from the MESSENGER probe to Mercury, to as <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the solar system as the Juno probe to Jupiter. The largest solar power system flown in space is the electrical system of the International Space Station.

2500|$|Dickson {{found another}} usage, {{referring}} to a high foul ball that travels a great distance, usually behind home plate.

Dickson wrote to King, who told him two years later that he had first heard the term when learning to play baseball in his own childhood, {{during a time when}} he lived, briefly, in Stratford, Connecticut. After he returned to his native Maine in 1958, the same year the Giants and Dodgers moved west, he recalled hearing it again. [...] "In both cases", he told Dickson, [...] "a Chinese home run was a foul ball, usually over the backstop". Dickson concluded from his correspondence that that use may well be limited to New England. All three definitions submitted to the online Urban Dictionary in the early 21st century are in accord with this usage.|$|E
2500|$|To {{a modern}} {{physicist}} working with Einstein's {{general theory of}} relativity, the situation is even more complicated than is suggested above. Einstein's theory suggests that it actually is valid to consider that objects in inertial motion (such as falling in an elevator, or in a parabola in an airplane, or orbiting a planet) can indeed be considered to experience a local loss of the gravitational field in their rest frame. Thus, in {{the point of view}} (or frame) of the astronaut or orbiting ship, there actually is nearly-zero proper acceleration (the acceleration felt locally), just as would be the case <b>far</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> space, away from any mass. It is thus valid to consider that most of the gravitational field in such situations is actually absent {{from the point of view}} of the falling observer, just as the colloquial view suggests (see equivalence principle for a fuller explanation of this point). However, this loss of gravity for the falling or orbiting observer, in Einstein's theory, is due to the falling motion itself, and (again as in Newton's theory) not due to increased distance from the Earth. However, the gravity nevertheless is considered to be absent. In fact, Einstein's realization that a pure gravitational interaction cannot be felt, if all other forces are removed, was the key insight to leading him to the view that the gravitational [...] "force" [...] can in some ways be viewed as non-existent. Rather, objects tend to follow geodesic paths in curved space-time, and this is [...] "explained" [...] as a force, by [...] "Newtonian" [...] observers who assume that space-time is [...] "flat," [...] and thus do not have a reason for curved paths (i.e., the [...] "falling motion" [...] of an object near a gravitational source).|$|E
