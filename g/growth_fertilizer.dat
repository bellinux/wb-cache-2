40|$|The {{application}} of charcoal to nutrient-poor upland soils {{of the central}} Amazon was tested in lysimeter studies in comparison to unamended control to evaluate the effects of charcoal on plant nutrition and nutrient leaching. Testing the {{application of}} charred organic matter was stimulated {{by the fact that}} anthropogenic soils in the Amazon (socalled "Terra Preta") with high soil organic matter contents contain large amounts of pyrogenic carbon. These soils also show high cation exchange capacity and nutrient availability. Charcoal additions significantly increased biomass production of a rice crop in comparison to a control on a Xanthic Ferralsol. This increase was largely an effect of improved P, K, and possibly Cu nutrition, whereas N and Mg uptake decreased in charcoal amended soils. In order to improve crop <b>growth,</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applications of N, S, Ca, and Mg may be necessary in addition to charcoal for optimizing rice growth. Combined application of N with charcoal resulted in a higher N uptake than what would have been expected from sole fertilizer or charcoal applications. The reason is a higher nutrient retention of applied ammonium by the charcoal amended soils. Charcoal applications therefore acted in two ways, first as a direct fertilizer and secondly as an adsorber which retained N. The amount of charcoal which can be produced from forest biomass is significant and corresponds to charcoal amounts needed for effectively improving crop growth. The slash-and-char technique is an alternative to burning of the above ground biomass and only the biomass from the same cropping area will be used for charring. Field trials need to be conducted to investigate the efficiency of charcoal production and applications under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|Recorded in the {{freshwater}} marsh sediment upstream is {{a dramatic}} increase in total phosphorus (TP) starting in 1950 – 1960, and, as in the Delaware River water, tracks the introduction of P detergent use. Although this might include increased use of P fertilizers, Marine Chemistry xx (2006) xxx–xxx www. elsevier. com/locate/marchem + modelthere is a substantial decrease after removal of the P detergent source in the mid- 1970 s. Carbon stable isotopes (d 13 C) track P changes after 1955. The heavier carbon isotope (13 C) corresponds to higher levels of P in the sediments (and water), while the lighter carbon (12 C) isotope in recent times corresponds to decreased use or discharge of P. In more recent times since the 1970 s, there is a significant relationship (p b 0. 05) between d 13 C and sediment P, while before 1965 there is a significant but different relationship. As such, the lower d 13 C of the sediment organic matter may record decreased growth/eutrophication when P loadings and concentrations are reduced. The N stable isotope record shows a marked increase in d 15 N (ca. 3. 5 x to 7. 5 x) starting in the early 1960 s.

A total of 450 kg N ha− 1 was added as urea over a 3 year period at the following rates: a single dose shortly after planting (O 1); 150 kg N ha− 1 applied once every year (AE); applications of 50 kg N ha− 1 three times per year (P); annual doses that increased with tree growth (AB: 50, 150, and 250 kg N ha− 1). Aboveground biomass production, N accumulation in biomass, and soil solution chemistry were measured between 1989 and 1992 in three replicate plots per treatment and compared with those in unfertilized control plots. The O 1 fertilization was inefficient because growth benefits were short-lived and were associated with excessive NO 3 leaching losses in the first year. Multiple fertilizer applications generally resulted in better growth, while soil solution NO 3 levels depended on the actual rate and frequency of fertilization. Nitrate leaching was greatest in the AE plots. The AB treatment, in which annual N additions increased commensurate with tree size, was optimum in terms of enhancing stem biomass production and reducing potential groundwater contamination. The reduction in fertilizer use efficiency and the increase in NO 3 leaching in the third year indicate that the input of 250 kg N ha− 1 exceeded tree N retention capacity and should have been reduced to approximately one-half that rate. Increasing the frequency of fertilization from once per year to three times per growing season also decreased NO 3 leaching losses (i. e. improved N recovery) without measurable benefits to biomass production, and may therefore not be cost-effective in commercial operations...|$|E

Since the country's independence, the agricultural sector has undergone many agricultural and rural development programs and structural reforms to enable the country to achieve food security and contribute to the economic <b>growth.</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> use in Morocco is still low and covers barely 50 % of the real needs. Also, the quantities used in average are well below the recommended ones. The mean consumption is about 50 kg fertilizers/ha with excessive application in some areas. Given this fact, fertilizer use must increase in order to reverse the current trends of low crop productivity and land degradation. Soils and soil fertility research conducted in Morocco have {{played a major role in}} the improvement of fertilizer use. Initial efforts focused on the identification of nutrient constraints in the field, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus. However, despite such developments, the impact at farm level is still far from satisfactory in terms of yield increases. IPNI North Africa is focusing on the implementation of the concept of 4 R Nutrient Stewardship by conducting research platforms on efficient use of fertilizers through the evaluation of fertilizer sources and their application rates and time in dryland and irrigated agriculture under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The approach is the integrated plant nutrition approach which seeks to improve nutrient-use efficiency, to build up nutrient stocks in the soil, and to limit losses to the environment. During the last two years, several research platforms were conducted in such a way to cover different agro-ecological zones, soil types and cropping systems in order to establish fertilizer recommendations for crops base on the cropping system practiced. Also, brochures, training materials and pocket guides on best management practices were developed. In addition to training, field days and farmers field schools.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.)

However, soils of West Africa are poor in phosphorus (P), a soil macro-nutrient all crops need for <b>growth.</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> with P is not readily available and is too expensive for West African farmers. This research was therefore, undertaken to identify cowpea lines that inherently grow well in P-deficient soils {{and use them to}} breed improved cowpea varieties that require less phosphorus fertilization. A hydroponic phenotypic screening method with silica sand was used to identify cowpea varieties that have tolerance to low soil P as measured by shoot dry biomass production. Both tolerant and susceptible varieties from the screen were further analyzed for root biomass, internal shoot P content, and internal root P content. Seed P, particularly the effect of cotyledon P, and total root production were investigated as physiological sources of tolerance. Tolerant cowpea varieties were crossed with susceptible varieties, and the resulting F_(1), F_(2) and BC_(1) seeds were screened to determine the inheritance and genetic control of tolerance. A Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population of a tolerant by susceptible cross was mapped using SSR markers to identify linkage groups or QTL for tolerance to low soil P. Phenotypic screening results identified four cowpea varieties to have P-deficiency tolerance (Big John, IT 97 K- 1069 - 6, IT 98 K- 476 - 8, and TX 2028 - 1 - 3 - 1) and three cowpea varieties (Big John, CB- 46, and Golden Eye Cream) to have partial P-deficiency tolerance via high seed P content. All varieties experienced increases in root production under low P treatments relative to normal P treatments. Phenotyping of F_(1), F_(2), and BC_(1) populations showed that low P tolerance is a heritable trait in cowpea with significant additive effects and narrow-sense heritability. Estimates of gene number suggested the tolerance to be a single-gene trait. Mapping linkage groups or QTL for low P tolerance identified QTL in which three SSR markers ?

The measurements include the profile distribution in soil and sediment. Measurement of nutrients and radionuclides was carried out using CHNS analyzer, EDXRF and Gamma Af spectrometer. The nutrients (N, P and K) and radionuclides (Ra, Ra, K, U and Th) at plantation B (Boh Tea Plantation) is higher than plantation A (Bharat Tea Plantation). N and P shows decreasing trends through the depth whereas K shows no observable trends in soil. In sediment, P and K show monotonic trends through the depth and N was not detected in sediment. Radionuclide does not show any observable trends through the depth in soil and sediment. The concentration range ofN at tea plantation areas is not detected - 3490 mg/kg for Plantation A and 400 - 9760 mg/kg for Plantation B.
