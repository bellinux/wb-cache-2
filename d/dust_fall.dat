40|$|Background: The {{phenomenon}} of dust {{is a serious}} environmental problem in dry and semi dry regions. It has a destructive effect for the residents of such regions. Over two-thirds of Iran is in areas of dry and semi-dry climate conditions. Methods: In this research, <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> measurements were taken in 41 stations across Yazd city using a marble dust collector (MDCO) located {{in different parts of}} the city. Next, the chemical characteristics of dust were determined using the XRF method. Finally, levels of <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> across the 4 seasons of the year and status of the constituent elements of dust were determined through ArcGIS software and the Kriging technique. The Raster calculator function was used to make determinations of the effects of <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> at each of the stations over the course of the year. Remote sensing system, along with maps taken from Landsat and the band combination technique were processed using ENVI software to extract vegetation density and building density maps of the studied region. Results: Results showed that spring had the highest level of <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> with a value of 200 g/cm 2. In total, in 109 km 2 of the studied region had average <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> of 110 g/m 2 that contributed to 12 057 tons of dust over Yazd city in 2015. The constituent elements of the <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> according to decreasing amounts were as follows: Si>Ca>Al>C>Mg>Fe>K>Na>S>Ti>Cl>P>Mn>Sr>Zn.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> {{events in}} Genoa and Turin (northern Italy) on 12 November 1996 and 7 December 1996 respectively. Meteorological {{data suggest that}} the dust-bearing rain that fell on Genoa originated in north-eastern Morocco, where dust mobilisation was reported two days earlier, and had been carried straight to the north-western Italian coast by very strong winds. But the <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> observed in Turin was not characterised by any specific synoptic situation inducing dust transport from the southern Mediterranean. The analyses include a quantitative and a qualitative study of two dust samples collected in downtown Genoa and Turin. The total amounts of dust that fell give two very high values of 4. 05 g m- 2 for Genoa and 0. 54 g m- 2 for Turin. The median sizes of the dust particles were 14. 6 µm and 25. 8 µm respectively. Most of the dust material collected in Genoa showed a yellowish-brown to red colour due to surface weathering by ferric hydroxides, and was sometimes coated with clayey particles. This attests to the Saharan origin of the particles. On the contrary, only 15 % of the material sampled in Turin was coated with red-like clayey material from the desert. A large part of the sample was covered with a carbon-like substance. In addition, the proportion of organic matter (pollen grains and seeds) and anthropogenic fibrous material was much higher. This suggests that the <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> observed in Turin very likely originated from local pollution mixed with a low proportion of long-distance Saharan dust. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Geometric mean (GM) lead dust-fall rate increased by > 40 -fold during demolition to 410 micro g Pb/m 2 /hr (2, 700 micro g Pb/m 2 per typical work day) and by > 6 -fold during debris removal to 61 micro g Pb/m 2 /hr (440 micro g Pb/m 2 per typical work day). Lead concentrations in <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> also increased during demolition (GM, 2, 600 mg/kg) and debris removal (GM, 1, 500 mg/kg) compared with baseline (GM, 950 mg/kg).

An active air sampler and health questionnaire were {{used in this study}} to assess seasonal and diurnal patterns of air quality and prevalent health conditions. Air was sampled {{with the use of a}} high volume air sampler to determine average total suspended particulates (TSP) and airborne metal concentrations. Twelve-hour air samples were collected over approximately five days and five nights during both the dry and rainy seasons in six communities. The six communities were located at different distances and directions from the nickel mines and smelter. Air samples were also collected at a reference site located further away from the smelter during the rainy season only. The composition of various metals was analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Twenty-four hour <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> accumulation in approximately 20 households in the seven communities previously mentioned, as well as in 20 homes located on Lake Matano were recorded with an area standardized Kim wipe swipe. Communities closer to and downwind from the smelter had significantly higher mean TSP values in the day of the dry season than communities further away from the smelter. Average concentrations of nickel, cobalt and chromium were higher in the day than in the night in the dry season in communities closer to and downwind from the smelter. There was only a slight significant regression of airborne nickel concentration with increasing distance from the smelter in the day of the dry season (Linear r²= 0. 276, p= 0. 006, Linear r²= 0. 066, p= 0. 207) but not in the night of the dry season. <b>Dust</b> <b>fall</b> accumulation did not vary significantly among the communities, except in Kampung Baru, a site also exposed to sawmill dust. A confidential health questionnaire administered by community volunteers assessed potential links between prevalent health conditions and mining and smelting in the area. Twenty households were selected in a convenience sampling in the eight communities where <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> accumulation was also studied. Adult and child versions of the questionnaire focused on respiratory and skin health conditions but also surveyed prevalence of other illnesses, and health determinants. Questionnaire responses showed that some health conditions typical of exposure to airborne particulates and nickel, such as asthma, rhinitis, and skin tumours, were more prevalent in areas closer to and downwind from nickel mining and smelting compared to Malili, a community located further away from the mines and smelter. Several positive correlations between ambient air pollution levels, <b>dust</b> <b>fall</b> accumulation in households, and health conditions typically found in nickel industrial areas suggested a potential human health impact of mining and smelting.

Samples collected revealed that topsoil copper concentrations were significantly higher than subsoil copper concentrations at the same sites. There was a significant linear decrease in topsoil to subsoil copper concentration relative to distance from the copper smelter and thus from the high-risk zone to the control area. Copper concentrations of unwashed plant material were significantly higher than washed plant material at the same sites, indicating the deposition of copper on the plant surfaces.

40|$|Abstract [...] The present {{investigation}} {{shows that the}} characteristics of mortars and concrete using Crushed stone dust as fine aggregate are superior {{when compared to the}} natural river sand as fine aggregate. The results pertain to the most commonly used grading zone – II sand. Crushed stone <b>dust</b> <b>falling</b> within the grading Zone II sand, grading limits specified by IS 383 code and manufactured from the hard rock is suitable as fine aggregate in masonry mortars. Also, IS- 2116 and IS 383 codes permit the use of crushed stone fine aggregate in masonry mortars...|$|R
40|$|Dust poses a {{particular}} challenge for historic libraries, where {{the quantity of}} fragile books makes the task of cleaning them labour-intensive, time-consuming and potentially damaging. This project investigates the frequency of cleaning appropriate in historic libraries, by monitoring the distribution of dust across shelves, the risks of high humidity causing cementation, and the usefulness of traditional <b>dust</b> <b>falls</b> (cloth or leather flap covering the gap between book and shelf above). The results enable book-cleaning teams and their managers to {{understand the relationship between}} visitors, dust and cementation, and to refine their cleaning regimes...|$|R
