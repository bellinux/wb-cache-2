40|$|In recent years, {{developments}} in the measuring of cardiac output and other haemodynamic variables {{are focused on the}} so-called minimally invasive methods. The aim of these methods is to simplify the management of high-risk and haemodynamically unstable patients. Due to the need of invasive approach and the possibility of serious complications the use of pulmonary artery catheter has decreased. This article describes the methods for measuring cardiac output, which are based on <b>volume</b> <b>measurement</b> (Fick method, <b>indicator</b> dilution method), pulse wave analysis, Doppler effect, and electrical bioimpedance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Peritoneal dialysate volume {{determined}} by <b>indicator</b> dilution <b>measurements.</b> Dialysate <b>volume</b> was simultaneously {{determined by}} two different indicator dilution techniques {{as a function}} of dwell time in a rabbit model of peritoneal dialysis using isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions. After a single injection of a large molecular weight index solute (SIIS) to the dialysis solution at a known concentration, the first indicator dilution technique determined dialysate volume by the change in the index solute concentration. In the second technique, dialysate volume was determined after multiple injections of a different index solute (MIIS) by measuring the change in concentration of the index solute two minutes after its injection into the dialysis solution. The volumes determined by SIIS were similar during isotonic, but larger during both hypertonic and hypotonic exchanges, than those determined by MIIS. Drained volume was dependent upon the peritoneal catheter used, was not different from that determined by MIIS, but was significantly smaller than that determined by SIIS. The present results suggest that systematic errors in <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> when using <b>indicator</b> dilution result from the loss of the index solute from the peritoneal cavity and are greater for SIIS than for MIIS. A model for fluid transfer during peritoneal dialysis showed that dialysate volumes determined by SIIS were useful, however, when estimating the rate of fluid movement across the peritoneal membrane...|$|R

40|$|The {{conductance}} catheter technique allows real- time <b>measurements</b> of ventricular <b>volume</b> {{based on}} changes in the electrical conductance of blood within the ventricular cavity. Conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> are corrected with a calibration coefficient, α, {{in order to improve}} accuracy. However, conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> are also affected by parallel conductance, which may confound cali-bration coefficient estimation. This study was un-dertaken to examine the variation in α using a physical model of the left ventricle without parallel conductance. Calibration coefficients were calculated as the conductance-volume quotient (αV(t)) or the stroke conductance-stroke volume quotient (αSV). Both calibration coefficients varied as a non-linear function of the ventricular <b>volume.</b> Conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> calibrated with αV(t) estimated ventricular volume to within 2. 0 ± 6. 9 %. By contrast, calibration with αSV substantially over-estimated the ventricular volume in a volume-dependent manner, increasing from 26 ± 20 % at 100 ml to 106 ± 36 % at 500 ml. The accuracy of conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> is affected by the choice of calibration coefficient. Using a fixed or constant calibration coeffi-cient will result in <b>volume</b> <b>measurement</b> errors. The conductance-stroke volume quotient is associated with particularly significant and volume-dependent measurement errors. For this reason, conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> should ideally be calibrated with an alternative measurement of ventricular vol-ume...|$|R
40|$|The {{conductance}} catheter technique enables continuous ventricular <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> {{based on}} the electrical conductance of blood within the ventricular cavity. However, ventricular excitation also produces a measurable electrical signal within the ventricular cavity. This study was undertaken to investigate {{the relationship between the}} ventricular electrogram and conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> in a physical model of the left ventricle without parallel conductance. The ventricular electrogram was simulated with an ECG signal, ECGinput connected to two ring electrodes within the model ventricle. Conductance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> were made with and without ECGinput. The difference between these measurements, GECG(t), represented the conductance volume due to ECGinput. GECG(t) varied {{as a function of the}} first-derivative of ECGinput with respect to time (r 2 = 0. 92, P< 0. 001). GECG(t), This primarily affected <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> during ventricular depolarisation; during this phase the <b>volume</b> <b>measurement</b> error varied widely between – 12 % and + 9 %. As a re-sult, end-diastole could not be reliably identified on the pressure-volume loop. The accuracy of conduc-tance <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> during late diastole and early isovolumic contraction are substantially affected by the ventricular electrogram. This may result in a significant error in end-diastolic volume estimates, which has important implications for the quantitative assessment of ventricular function including, in particular, the assessment of chamber compliance...|$|R

40|$|Many prior {{researches}} {{found that}} most of students in grade five tended to have difficulty in fully grasping the concept of <b>volume</b> <b>measurement</b> {{because they have to}} build their competence in spatial structuring. The unit of <b>volume</b> “packing” <b>measurement</b> must be integrated and coordinated in three-dimension. On the other hand, it is revealed the errors that students made on the <b>volume</b> <b>measurement</b> tasks with three dimensional cube arrays are related to some aspects of spatial visualization, such as the skill to "read off" two-dimensional representation of solid objects. For those reasons, this research is aimed to develop classroom activities with the use of spatial visualization tasks to support students’ spatial structuring in learning <b>volume</b> <b>measurement.</b> Consequently, design research was chosen as an appropriate means to achieve this research goal.
