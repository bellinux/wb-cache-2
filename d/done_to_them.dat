5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on what can be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> These rights cannot be violated, even {{in the name of}} the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than had been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E

25|$|The play itself {{initially}} {{meets with}} a mixed reception, {{due to its}} controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both Hamlet and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over.

25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} year of Agrippa's reign (corresponding with the 12th year of Nero's reign), Agrippa {{tried desperately to}} avert a war with Rome, when he saw his countrymen {{generally}} disposed to fight against Rome, because of certain insults and abuses they had had under the Roman procurator, Gessius Florus. At this time, they had broken-off the cloisters leading from Antonia Fortress to the Temple Mount where Roman soldiers were wont to keep guard during the Jewish holidays, and they refused to pay the tribute which was due to Caesar. Agrippa convened the people and urged instead that they tolerate the temporary injustices <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and submit themselves to Roman hegemony. At length, Agrippa failed to prevent his subjects from rebelling, whereas, during a certain holiday when the Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, had passed through Judea to quell the rebellion, he was routed by Jewish forces. By 66 the citizenry of Jerusalem expelled their king, Agrippa, and his sister, Berenice, from Jerusalem. During the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–73, he sent 2,000 men, archers and cavalry, to support Vespasian, showing that, although a Jew in religion, he was entirely devoted to the Roman Empire. He accompanied Titus on some campaigns, and was wounded at the siege of Gamla. After the capture of Jerusalem, he went with his sister Berenice to Rome, where he was invested with the dignity of praetor and rewarded with additional territory.|$|E

In the hallucination, Oliver finds himself back at Queen Manor, having never gotten on The Queen's Gambit, where {{he is about to}} be married to Laurel Lance, both his parents are alive, and Diggle is the Hood. Oliver begins seeing flashes of his former life, as do Sara, Ray, Diggle, and Thea, making them realize what the Dominators have <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They decide to try and escape, but their attempt is blocked by each of their own enemy: Malcolm Merlyn, Deathstroke and one of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fiancée Anna Loring), Damien Darhk and his H.I.V.E. soldiers (including Andy Diggle). The adversaries are all defeated, and the captives are able to escape, resulting in them waking up inside the Dominators ship.

One of Badruddin's slaves, Japar survived the attack and intercepted HMS Hazard, which brought him to Sarawak to inform Brooke. Enranged by the news, Brooke organised an expedition to avenge Hashim's death with the aid of Cochrane from the Royal Navy with Phlegethon. On 6 July 1846, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II complained through a letter about the discourtesy of HMS Hazard and invited Cochrane to ascend the capital with two boats. Phlegethon and other vessels then moved up to the river on 8 July where they were fired on from every position with slight damage. Mahkota and the Sultan retreated [...] upriver while most of the population fled upon their arrival at Brunei's capital, leaving the brother of the Sultan's son, Pengiran Muhammad, who was badly wounded and Pengiran Mumin, an opponent of the Sultan's son who despised the decision of his royal family to be involved in conflict with the British. The British destroyed the town forts and invited the population to return with no harm to be <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> while the Sultan remained hiding in the jungle.

They said to one another that surely they were guilty concerning their brother, and so now this distress had come upon them. Reuben said that he had told them not to sin against their brother, but they had not listened. They did not realize that Joseph understood them, for he used an interpreter, and Joseph turned aside and wept. When Joseph returned, he bound Simeon before their eyes, and commanded that their vessels be filled with grain and that their money be restored to their sacks. They loaded their donkeys and departed. When they came to a lodging-place, one of them opened his sack and found his money, and their spirits fell, wondering what God had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They went home and told Jacob all that had happened, and Jacob accused them of bereaving him of his children, first Joseph and now Simeon, and told them that they would not take Benjamin away. Reuben answered that Jacob could kill Reuben's two sons if Reuben failed to bring Benjamin back, but Jacob insisted that his son would not go down with them, for Joseph was dead and only he was left, and if harm befall Benjamin then it would be the death of Jacob. The famine continued, and Jacob told the brothers to buy more grain. But Judah reminded Jacob that the man had warned them that they could not see his face unless their brother came with them, so if Jacob sent their brother they could buy food, but if Jacob did not send him they could not go. Jacob asked them why they had treated him so ill as to tell the man that they had a brother. They explained that the man asked them directly about their kindred, whether their father was alive, and whether they had another brother, and they answered him; how were they to know that he would ask them to bring their brother down? Judah then asked Jacob to send the lad with him, so that they could go and the family could live, and Judah would serve as surety for him, for they could have been to Egypt and back by then if they had not lingered. Relenting, Jacob directed them to take a present for the man, double money in case the return of their payment was an oversight, and also their brother, and Jacob prayed that God might show them mercy before the man and that he might release Simeon and Benjamin to them. So the brothers went to Joseph. The long fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
