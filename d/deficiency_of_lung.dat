50|$|Dominating qi has two aspects: {{dominating}} the qi of respiration and {{dominating the}} qi {{of the entire}} body. Dominating the qi of respiration means the lung is a respiratory organ through which the qi of the exterior and the qi from the interior are able to mingle. Via the lung, the body inhales clear qi from the natural environment and exhales waste qi from {{the interior of the}} body. Dominating qi of the entire body means that the function of the lung in respiration greatly influences the functional activities of the body, and is closely related to the formation of pectoral qi, which is formed from the combination of the essential qi of water and food, and the clear qi inhaled by the lung. When the lung’s function of dominating qi is normal, the passage of qi will be unobstructed and respiration will be normal and smooth. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> qi may lead to general fatigue, feeble speech, weak respiration, shortness of breath and excessive perspiration.|$|E

Methods: Four hundred and thirty patients with bronchial asthma were randomly investigated. The information acquired through the four diagnostic methods was recorded and the database was established by Amos software, and then the data were analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

Conclusion: According to the results of CFA with 6 factors and with the standard regression coefficient 0. 4 as primary and secondary critical points, the syndromes in patients with bronchial asthma can be classified into 5 types, which are syndromes of cold fluid retained in lung, phlegm-heat obstructing lung, wind-phlegm blocking lung, qi <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> and kidney and qi deficiency of spleen...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory Distress Syndrome {{is a name}} {{given to}} a disease {{affecting}} newborn babies, especially those born before term. Its full title is "idiopathic respira-tory distress syndrome of the newborn", {{and it is also}} called "hyaline membrane disease", a title which carries the assumption that, should the lung become available for histology, hyaline membranes will be found in the alveoli. Possibly, at the present state of knowledge, it should be called "pulmonary surfactant deficiency disease of the newborn. " There are, of course, a number of causes of respiratory difficulty and distress in newborn babies (Avery and Fletcher, 1974). Any discussion of the management of Respira-tory Distress Syndrome (RDS) must start with the assumption that clinical and radiological criteria for the diagnosis have been met (Scopes, 1971). Although there are some general measures common to manag-ing all babies with respiratory difficulties, precise details will inevitably depend on precise diagnosis. The disease is common, occurring in about 1 % of all live births (about one in three of all preterm births, Swyer, 1975). Since very small babies born well before term {{are more likely to have}} the condition and die as a result (Dunn, 1965), figures on incidence and mortality can be very parochial, depending on the population of babies born. However, the incidence and mortality have probably decreased in the past decade (Roberton and Tizard, 1975) although the overall mortality of about 20 % (Swyer, 1975) still makes it a serious cause of neonatal mortality. CAUSE The basic problem is a relative <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> surfactant in the baby, associated with prematurity (Avery and Mead, 1959) and aggravated by inter-ference with synthesis in alveolar cells and by hypoxia, acidaemia, asphyxia or substrate shortage.

Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a disease of preterm infants mainly caused by pulmonary immaturity as evidenced by a <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> mature <b>lung</b> surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is known to stabilize small alveoli and prevent them from collapsing during expiration. However, apart from alveoli, surfactant also lines the narrow conducting airways of the tracheobronchial tree.

Its potential role as a therapeutic biomaterial in chronic obstructive airway diseases, namely asthma, chronic bronchitis, and respiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis, are discussed. This paper also attempts to elucidate the exact steps in the pathogenic pathway of these diseases which could be reversed by supplementation of exogenous surfactant formulations. It is shown that there is great potential for the use of present day surfactants (which are actually formulated for use in Respiratory Disease Syndrome) as therapy in the aforementioned diseases of altered mucus viscoelasticity and mucociliary clearance. However, for improved effectiveness, specific surfactant formulations satisfying certain specific criteria should be tailor-made for the clinical condition for which they are intended.

Pulmonary surfactant is known to stabilize small alveoli and prevent them from collapsing during expiration due to its unique surface properties. A pulsating bubble surfactometer was used for in vitro analysis of surface parameters of therapeutic surfactants and of test formulations {{to be used for}} exogenous therapy in Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Surface parameters that were considered for comparison were minimum surface tension (gamma (min)) at three different frequencies (20, 40 and 60 cpm), adsorption at two extreme bubble radii (R-min and R-max), stability index at the three frequencies, recruitment index and the surface viscoelastic parameters. Survanta, ALEC and Exosurf were compared with formulations consisting of the main phospholipids of pulmonary surfactant, namely dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) as well as binary mixtures of these phospholipids in the ratio 2 : 3. Survanta performed much better than the non-protein therapeutic surfactants in all parameters and at all three frequencies. Exosurf had a very low stability index and a very low modulus of surface dilatational elasticity at all three frequencies. The test compounds showed a frequency dependence in their performance. At 20 cpm, PC:PG (2 : 3) was the best test combination. It achieved a gamma (min) and stability index equivalent to Survanta at this frequency.

40|$|Background The {{morbidity}} and mortality of hyaline membrane dis- ease (HMD) are quite high due to delayed diagnosis and intervention. Commonly, HMD occurs in preterm infants with surfactant <b>deficiency</b> because <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> immaturity. Lung maturity test could be performed using biochemical, biophysical, and amniotic fluid turbidity test. Objective To find out HMD prevalence {{and the value of}} shake test and lamellar body concentration in diagnosing HMD in preterm infants. Methods This was a cross-sectional study carried out at Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung on preterm infants born during October- December 2001. The shake test was performed using gastric fluid and amniotic fluid while the lamellar body concentration was per- formed using amniotic fluid. Results During the 3 -month period, 571 infants were born, of 64 (11. 2 %) preterm infants, only 41 (64 %) fulfilled the inclusion crite- ria; among those preterm infants, 14 (34 %) suffered from respira- tory distress and 7 suffered from HMD (prevalence 17 %). All HMD cases occurred in infants less than 32 weeks for gestational age. In 7 preterm infants with HMD, the shake test of gastric fluid ob- tained by lavage showed negative results in 3 and + 1 in 4 infants; while the shake test of amniotic fluid revealed negative result in 5 and + 1 in 2 infants. Lamellar body concentration of amniotic fluid was ≤ 18, 000 /ml in all HMD infants. Among three infants less than 32 weeks for gestational age who did not suffer from HMD, + 1 shake test of gastric fluid was found in 2 infants and + 2 in 1 infant; while shake test of amniotic fluid showed negative result in 1 infant and + 1 in 2; the lamellar body concentration of amniotic fluid was ≤ 18, 000 /ml in 2 infants and > 18, 000 /ml in 1 infant.

Mice with selective <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> TGFβ receptor 2 (TGFβR 2) in lung epithelium were generated and crossed to cell fate reporter mice that express β-galactosidase (β-gal) in cells <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> epithelial lineage. Mice were given intratracheal bleomycin (0. 08 U), and the following parameters were assessed: AEC death by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling assay, inflammation by total and differential cell counts from bronchoalveolar lavage, fibrosis by scoring <b>of</b> trichrome-stained <b>lung</b> sections, and total lung collagen content. Mice with <b>lung</b> epithelial <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> TGFβR 2 had improved AEC survival, despite greater lung inflammation, after bleomycin administration. At 3 wk after bleomycin administration, mice with epithelial TGFβR 2 deficiency showed a significantly attenuated fibrotic response in the lungs, as determined by semiquantitatve scoring and total collagen content. The reduction in lung fibrosis in these mice was associated with a marked decrease in the lung fibroblast population, both total lung fibroblasts and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-derived (S 100 A 4 +/β-gal+) fibroblasts.

40|$|Newborn {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (RDS) {{results from}} a <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> pulmonary surfactant. Surfactant has three ultrastructural forms: lamellar bodies, which, when secreted from Type II pneumocytes, transform into tubular myelin; tubular myelin in turn {{gives rise to the}} phospholipid monolayer at the air-fluid interface in the alveolus that constitutes functional surfactant. It has been shown previously that the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> infants dying from RDS lacked tubular myelin despite the presence of abundant lamellar bodies, whereas the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> control infants dying from other causes had both tubular myelin and lamellar bodies. An abnormality in the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin in RDS was proposed as a possible explanation for this finding. To evaluate the role of surfactant proteins (SPs) in this conversion, the authors re-examined the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> 11 RDS infants and 10 control infants for reactivity with antisera to high and low molecular weight SPs. In control infants, abundant intense staining with antisera to both types of SPs was found, but in the RDS lungs, staining was weaker than that in controls and less intense for high molecular weight compared to low molecular weight SPs. In lungs from patients with RDS, although staining increased with increasing gestational and post-natal ages, the intensity was less than control levels at all ages. The correlation <b>of</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> SPs in RDS with lack of tubular myelin suggests that SPs may be involved in the conversion of normal lamellar bodies to tubular myelin and that the <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> SPs could explain the persistent respiratory distress in the presence of surfactant phospholipid synthesis...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a current}} hypothesis, {{pulmonary}} emphysema results from {{damage to the}} elastic fiber network caused by an imbalance within the lower respiratory tract between elastase(s) and protease inhibitors. This hypothesis is based largely on studies of persons with genetic <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> serum alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor. We recently reported a spontaneously occurring emphysema in the pallid mouse with an inherited <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> serum alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor. This animal reproduces important features of the human condition. We describe here the changes in alveolar elastolytic burden and in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell population, which precede and accompany the development of emphysema in pallid mice. A possible correlation between the levels <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> elastase burden and the loss <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> elastin content was investigated {{in the period of}} development of emphysema in pallid mice. Changes in alveolar cells were investigated for specimens from BAL fluids and lung tissue by cytologic, histologic, and immunogold-electron microscopic methods. An immunogold-positive reaction for elastase was observed on elastin within the alveolar walls of pallid mice from 2 months onward. The average of gold particle density progressively increased with age, reaching high values at 12 and 16 months of age, the age at which parenchymal destruction was previously reported to occur. Lung elastin content had normal values at 2, 4, and 8 months of age. However, it was significantly lower at 12 and 16 months of age. The immunogold values of elastase burden correlated inversely with the decrease in lung elastin content. Total and differential cell counts from BAL fluids of pallid mice did not differ significantly at any time in life and were similar to age-matched controls. However, in pallid mice from 8 months of life onward, pulmonary macrophages contained characteristic intracytoplasmic crystalloid inclusions, which were electrondense and bounded by a single membrane. Using electron microscopy and an immunogold-labeling technique with anti-mouse I-III collagen IgG, these inclusions were identified as collagen-derived products. The data reported in this paper suggest that emphysematous lesions in pallid mice are associated with a progressive increase of elastase in alveolar intestitium and with loss <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> elastin. Surprisingly, the number of neutrophils in BAL fluids does not increase with the increase <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> elastolytic burden. However, intracytoplasmic crystalloid inclusions related to collagen degradation were observed in pulmonary macrophages of pallid mice at the time of septal disruption. The presence of similar structures in alveolar macrophages from mice or other animal species may be indicative of connective tissue breakdown or remodeling of tissue collagen...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} is {{a complex}} of lipids and proteins assembled and secreted by the alveolar epithelium into the thin layer of fluid coating the respiratory surface <b>of</b> <b>lungs.</b> There, surfactant forms interfacial films at the airwater interface, reducing dramatically surface tension and thus stabilizing the air-exposed interface to prevent alveolar collapse along respiratory mechanics. The absence or <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> surfactant produces severe lung pathologies. This review describes {{some of the most}} important surfactant-related pathologies, which are a cause of high morbidity and mortality in neonates and adults. The review also updates current therapeutic approaches pursuing restoration of surfactant operative films in diseased lungs, mainly through supplementation with exogenous clinical surfactant preparations.
