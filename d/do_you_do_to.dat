6000|$|Mr. Mainwaring's {{dinner was}} very good and his wines were excellent,--a fact of which Mr. Mainwaring himself was much better aware {{than any of his}} guests. There is a {{difficulty}} in the giving of dinners of which Mr. Mainwaring and some other hosts have become painfully aware. What service <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> any one in pouring your best claret down his throat, when he knows no difference between that and a much more humble vintage,--your best claret which you feel so sure you cannot replace? Why import canvas-back ducks for appetites which would be quite as well satisfied with those out of the next farm-yard? Your soup, which has been a care since yesterday, your fish, got down with so great trouble from Bond Street on that very day, your saddle of mutton, in selecting which you have affronted every butcher in the neighbourhood, are all plainly thrown away! And yet the hospitable hero who would fain treat his friends as he would be treated himself can hardly arrange his dinners according to the palates of his different guests; nor will he like, when strangers sit at his board, to put nothing better on his table than that cheaper wine with which needful economy induces him to solace himself when alone. I,--I who write this,--have myself seen an honoured guest deluge with the pump my, ah! so hardly earned, most scarce and most peculiar vintage! There is a pang in such usage which some will not understand, but which cut Mr. Mainwaring to the very soul. There was not one among them there who appreciated the fact that the claret on his dinner table was almost the best that its year had produced. It was impossible not to say a word on such a subject at such a moment;--though our rector was not a man who usually lauded his own viands.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the behaviors that caregivers report carrying out to maintain their own health, and to compare the health-promoting behaviors of Black and White caregivers. Although many studies have examined health-promoting behaviors, few have examined health promotion among caregivers. Reported studies of caregivers’ health-promoting behaviors have not compared cultural groups. The sample for this study was selected by random digit dialing, and included 136 Black and 257 White caregivers of frail elders. Content analysis of respondents’ answers to the open-ended question, “In general, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stay healthy?” was used to address the research questions. Most caregivers reported specific behaviors they engaged in for the purpose of staying healthy. Although most of their behaviors addressed physical health, caregivers also mentioned behaviors that contribute to mental and spiritual health. Both differences and similarities were found in Black and White caregivers’ self-reported health behaviors, which have important implications for nursing practice and research in the future...|$|E

40|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> reduce student {{attrition}} {{when there}} is negligible funding and your faculty will not permit remedial or developmental coursework? This was the question asked by the UMKC university-wide retention committee in 1972. The response to that question initiated the program known as Supplemental Instruction © (SI) and the more recent Video-based Supplemental Instruction © (VSI). The context of this question sets an important framework for our paper. A decade earlier, the University of Missouri had reached out to a small, private university in Kansas City along with several private professional schools and a private conservatory of music. The resultant amalgamation and reorganization produced the University of Missouri- Kansas City. As a public institution, UMKC faced some difficult adjustments, {{the first of which}} was a change in patterns of student access. Instead of limiting the student clientele to the affluent top 20 percent of high school graduates, the university now offered admission to a much more culturally and academically diverse population. This change was particularly difficult for many of the faculty who had come to the university precisely because the students wer...|$|E

Perhaps your company already assesses its network configurations regularly, all the applications in use have been reviewed for stringent security guidelines, maybe the IT team has even classified all your corporate information assets, and the vulnerability assessments are complete. Does this mean the CIO can relax? Is the business safe? Is your network or information accessed by a third party vendor? Where is your information being managed, stored or processed?

40|$|Drawing on {{the classic}} model of {{balanced}} affect proposed by Bradburn (The structure of psychological well-being, Aldine, Chicago, IL, 1969), this study conceptualised poor work-related psychological health in terms of high levels of negative affect {{in the absence of}} acceptable levels of positive affect. In order to illuminate self-perceptions of work-related psychological health among a well-defined group of clergy, a random sample of 58 ministers of word and sacrament serving within the west midlands synod of the United Reformed Church in England completed an open-ended questionnaire concerned with the following six guiding questions. Do you enjoy your work? How would you define stress? How would you define burnout? What stresses are there in your ministry? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep healthy? What can the church do to enhance the work-related psychological health of ministers? Content analysis highlighted the main themes recurring through these open-ended responses. The conclusion is drawn that ministers of word and sacrament within the United Reformed Church in England are exposed to a number of recurrent recognisable sources of stress. Suggestions are advanced regarding the need for future more detailed research and for the development of more effective pastoral strategies...|$|E

40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} occur {{frequently in}} elite athletes. Understanding what professionals {{who work with}} patients with sports injuries think about prevention has been suggested as an important aspect to improve the effectiveness of programs to prevent sports injuries. Objectives: To describe and characterize the opinions of physical therapists, physicians and trainers on 'risk factors' and 'prevention of injury' in elite athletes. Method: This is a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews {{with members of the}} medical and technical department of the Brazilian delegation who participated in the Pan American Games of Guadalajara 2011. The interview was conducted using two questions: 1) "What do you think can cause injuries in athletes participating in your sport?" 2) "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent injuries in your sport?" The interviews were analyzed in two stages, the identification of thematic units, followed by the categorization and grouping of thematic units. Results: We interviewed a total of 30 professionals. Regarding question 1, the main factors attributed as responsible for injury were over-training and incorrect sports techniques. Regarding question 2, the main reported strategies used to prevent injuries were muscle strengthening, nutritional counseling and guidance. Conclusions: The main factors affecting the appearance of lesions were over-training, incorrect sports technique, inadequate nutrition and factors related to the athlete's behavior. The main injury prevention strategies were muscle strengthening, nutritional counseling and guidance...|$|E
