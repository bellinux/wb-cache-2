Most South American countries have expressed support for the Argentine position and called for negotiations to restart at regional summits.

Conversely, the Republic of China (Taiwan) acknowledges British sovereignty and ignores Argentina's sovereignty claim.|$|E
25|$|The Wilton-Ridgefield rivalry {{started in}} 1987 when, after a heated hockey game, a bench-clearing brawl erupted. After 10 minutes of fighting, two {{students}} {{had to go to}} the hospital and nearly everyone on both teams was suspended. The fans on both sides met after the game outside of the rink (Winter Garden Ice Arena) and proceeded to fight for up to an hour.

25|$|In {{the past}} China {{promoted}} eugenics {{as part of}} its population planning policies, but the government <b>has</b> <b>backed</b> away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws. Recent research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of informed consent in China. Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a pre-marital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.|$|E

25|$|Raja Petra later distanced {{himself from}} the {{statutory}} declaration {{in an interview with}} TV3, saying his accusations linking Najib and Rosmah to the murder was repeating information passed onto him by opposition figures, rather than information he knew to be true himself. He stated that he did not genuinely believe that Rosmah was at the murder scene. The Malaysian Civil Liberties Movement alleged the interview was heavily edited and spin doctored in favour of Prime Minister Najib Razak {{just in time for the}} upcoming Sarawak state elections. Raja Petra <b>has</b> <b>backed</b> up this assertion during an interview with Malaysiakini.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 2004, the U.S. Department of Transportation {{issued the}} company {{what it called}} the world's first license for a sub-orbital manned rocket flight. The license was {{approved}} by the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which <b>has</b> <b>backed</b> licenses for more than 150 commercial launches of unmanned launch vehicles in its 20 years, but never a license for manned flight on a sub-orbital trajectory. The Mojave Airport, operating part-time as Mojave Spaceport, is the launch point for SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipOne performed the first privately funded human spaceflight on June 21, 2004. Flight 16P on September 29, 2004 and Flight 17P on October 4, 2004 won the X-Prize for Scaled Composites and SpaceShipOne.|$|E

The club has been a firm supporter of Erskine, a charity which provides long-term medical care for veterans of the British Armed Forces, and in 2012, donated £25,000 to fund projects within their care homes. In January 2015, Rangers hosted a charity match {{for the benefit of}} former player Fernando Ricksen who had been diagnosed with Motor neurone disease and this raised £320,000 for him and MND Scotland.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} this claim has been {{difficult}} to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters <b>has</b> <b>backed</b> away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book [...] by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found [...] their flight was impossible, but [...] "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the episode}} is devoted to {{references}} and allusions to other works, {{as well as the}} show itself. The title sequence is deliberately shorter than most other episodes, poking fun at shows like Lost as well as the Sci-Fi Channel itself, which had shortened SG-1's Season 9 opening but changed it back after fans demanded it. When Martin learns that his main actor <b>has</b> <b>backed</b> out of the movie, the SG-1 team offers various suggestions for how to replace him or work around his non-availability—a reference to Michael Shanks's absence from the sixth season of Stargate SG-1. Anderson himself also pokes fun at the ending of the eighth-season episode , which was intended to be the series finale before the ninth season was announced. The final scene of [...] "200", which features interviews with the Wormhole X-Treme cast, was added as an afterthought, and contains comments from the real cast which were used out of context as an inside joke.|$|E
