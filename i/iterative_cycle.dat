30|$|DBR guides theory development, {{improves}} instructional design, {{extends the}} application of results, and identifies new design possibilities (Cobb et al., 2003; Edelson, 2002). A DBR approach consists of <b>iterative</b> <b>cycles</b> of design, enactment, analysis, and redesign. This helps in augmenting the intervention {{on the basis of}} the “failures” in the earlier research cycles. In order to get an idea about the extent to which features of the environment were able to achieve this goal, we embarked on an iterative cyclic process and adapted the DBR methodology by Reeves (2000). This process contains stages in which practical problems are analyzed by the researcher, a prototype of the solution is developed, <b>iterative</b> <b>cycles</b> of testing and refinement of solution are carried out, and design principles are generated based on reflection.|$|R

50|$|The {{process is}} then an <b>iterative</b> <b>cycle</b> {{of making a}} small program transformation, testing it to ensure correctness, and making another small transformation. If at any point a test fails, the last small change is undone and {{repeated}} in a different way. Through many small steps the program moves from where it was to {{where you want it}} to be. For this very iterative process to be practical, the tests must run very quickly, or the programmer would have to spend a large fraction of his or her time waiting for the tests to finish. Proponents of extreme programming and other agile software development describe this activity {{as an integral part of}} the software development cycle.|$|E

Over {{the course of one}} academic year, twelve teachers in two secondary schools engaged in this research as a double case study of teacher learning within a lesson study community.

5000|$|MOHID Land uses an {{adaptive}} time-stepping method in its main hydrodynamic cycle. Within an <b>iterative</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{if the water}} volume — of reach or overland flow or porous media — varies more than a user defined percentage during two consecutive time steps, the model automatically decreases the time step. Thereafter the model recalculates the current solution with a smaller time step for the affected process (reach or overland flow or porous media). This process is repeated until the volume variation {{is less than the}} user defined value mentioned above. The time step dynamically increases again when the model verifies that flow is “stable”. For example within the module [...] "Drainage Network" [...] the time step may be reduced to very short intervals during flush events.This procedure avoids the occurrence of negative volumes and optimizes {{the time it takes to}} make a certain simulation, without compromising model stability. Time steps of the processes — computed in the different sub-models — can be chosen differently, adding more to the optimization of the computational cost.|$|E

Through the use of case studies we examine if primary teachers can, and to what extent, engage in experiments in teaching, an <b>iterative</b> <b>cycle</b> of three main components: conjecture (posing questions and making conjectures about teaching or learning), implementation (teaching episodes are planned and taught), and analysis which guides the next teaching episode as a intentional method for improving teaching and increasing student learning.

40|$|The Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) {{industry}} {{is one of}} the multidisciplinary domains in which collaboration among related parties is of utmost importance.

Most of the current process modelling tools in the AEC industry do not enable analyses of <b>iterative</b> information <b>cycles.</b> Moreover, these tools represent the process at high levels, thus, they are inadequate for multi-parameter problems like building design. With a view to alleviate these problems, this paper introduces the use of parameter-based design structure matrix as a process modelling and system analysis tool for building design. The method reveals insights into the process structure, optimum sequence of parameter decisions, <b>iterative</b> <b>cycles</b> and concurrency in the process.
