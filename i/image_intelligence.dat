40|$|Children {{appear to}} retain the {{information}} they read in literature better than that which they read in their text books. Studies of children 2 ̆ 7 s books, therefore, are a valuable resource for gauging the messages internalized by children throughout their education. Most past examinations of children 2 ̆ 7 s books focus on gender stereotyping and demonstrate that children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, highly gender-biased in the past, is slowly improving in its egalitarianism. Less attention has been directed at biases against minority ethnic groups. This study included a content analysis of the literature incorporated {{in the elementary school}} curricula of different schools, focusing on gender and cultural biases which may be reflected in these books. Thirty general interest books read in the fourth and fifth grades (fifteen per grade) were compared with thirty multicultural books written for fourth and fifth graders (fifteen per grade) in terms of how they portrayed male and female characters of different ethnic groups. Findings indicated that minority characters, while depicted positively on the whole, were underrepresented in the general interest books. No significant differences were found in terms of character <b>image,</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and socioeconomic status for various ethnic and gender groups. The adjectives used to describe Asian characters in multicultural books were evaluated out of context and perceived significantly more negatively than those adjectives used with reference to African or Native American characters.

40|$|CommunicationNo {{process is}} as old and simple as that of intelligence: using a {{defector}} to obtain information from the “other side”, {{especially in the case}} of a closed political system such as the Soviet Regime. In the first twenty years of the Cold War, the CIA was not very familiar with this game 1. Reasons were diverse: its inability to operate in the USSR before 1961, because of the opposition of the State Department; the strong control of the KGB in the Soviet territory, that made it quite impossible for an American to operate freely, and on the Soviet people during Stalin’s era. A logical consequence were the technical programs devised by the CIA to obtain Signal and <b>Image</b> <b>Intelligence</b> data. At the same time, the CIA was the object of many suspicions and attacks in the USA due to the fact that it remained a permanent intelligence agency, even in peacetime 2. Following revelations of major soviet infiltrations in Roosevelt’s administrations and Donovan’s set, the second “Red Scare”, organised by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and led by John Edgar Hoover’s FBI, the CIA was a firm target. In a way, the main attack that happened was not against Cord Meyer, in the summer of 1953, when he was accused of being a communist; it was more against Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) Philby, a Special Intelligence Service liaison with the CIA between 1949 and 1951.

40|$|When BML was {{conceived}} for C 2 -to-simulation interoperation back in 2000, {{the idea to}} control robotic autonomous forces using BML had already been considered. Over the past few years, starting in 2010, we have at last implemented this idea and we are running several projects focusing on multi-robot systems controlled by BML. In this paper, we present the concepts of how to implement command of multi-robot systems using BML. In addition, we discuss how BML, developed for C 2 -to-simulation interoperation needed to be adjusted to fit the requirements for commanding multi-robot systems. In order to command multi-robot systems we created a control/planning node that receives high-level tasks in BML and disaggregates them into simple BML tasks such to move or {{to take a picture}} of an object being observed (<b>image</b> <b>intelligence</b> gathering). This node also takes care of the reporting. For example, it may receive task status reports for several ongoing basic tasks and from this it can calculate the aggregated task status report for the corresponding high-level task. Along with task status reports, general status reports and position reports have been dealt with. However, there are still many more aspects which robots can report on that might be relevant for users. Since we are using reconfigurable robots, the user may need to know the current configuration of each robot which thus is to be conveyed by a report. For these kinds of reports we use the so-called "WhoHolding" reports. Of course, the robots also have to report sensor data collected. Therefore, we have developed reports for pictures taken, videos recorded, and sensor measurements such as temperature, gas concentrations etc. For all these kinds of information we have extended the BML schemata taking the general BML "look and feel" into account...|$|E

40|$|Video {{and image}} {{enhancement}} {{relate to the}} age old problem of constructing new image detail to effect a more pleasurable viewing experience in video sequences and images. The image processing procedure described in this thesis is image and video interpolation, but the discussed algorithms are easily applicable to other areas {{in a variety of}} fields. The motivations behind resolution enhancement span the full spectrum of government to commercial to medical applications. For example, video quality from on-demand sites such as YouTube, Daily Motion, and Veoh, where hit counts sometimes reach 4. 7 million viewers per day, have traded off quality for bandwidth; travelers who use Google Map's Street View cannot read signs, see landmarks from the provided low-resolution panoramic; Google Earth® and government contractors in <b>image</b> <b>intelligence</b> demand for increasing resolution in satellite imagery. The long list of applications goes on, including applications such as web-photo editing, MRI scan feature enhancements, on-demand creation of HDTV content, etc. The image interpolation problem is an inherently ill- posed problem, and quality assessments of the resulting images are often driven by human decision rather than numerical analysis. By computer learning, the best viewing performance can be achieved by mimicking the human decision-making process. Therefore, this thesis is concerned with modeling machine and statistical learning techniques to fit the interpolation framework, while easily modified to accommodate other video and image processing problems in general. Specifically, we learn properties in a training set by using regression to map a relationship between known and unknown information. The known information by our definitions are low-resolution images while unknown information are high-resolution images. Machine learning is a particularly broad topic, and we can approach the image interpolation problems in several different ways. Our input space is the image patch domain, where we process fixed-size contiguous subsets of the image independently. Consequently, we first discuss properties of the feature space and propose a multivariate probability distribution function to describe the image patch domain. Knowledge of the distribution and properties of the feature space is especially conducive to both parametric and nonparametric estimation techniques. Because k-nearest neighbors is a relatively simple and commonly used nonparametric estimation technique, we propose a nearest neighbor algorithm that adaptively finds the appropriate number of neighbors to use and then performs the necessary regression steps. The algorithm also imposes global constraints through a heavily approximated Markov Random Field. Due to runtime considerations, we explore quicker ways to search for the k nearest neighbors of a given input. Next, we investigate the use of kernel-based methods by employing support vector regression. We improve the generalization potential for nonlinear relationships by proposing convex optimization problems focused in kernel learning. There are various interpolation frameworks that can include the newly proposed regression technique, and we experiment with several. Ultimately, we propose a mixture of experts framework to describe the relationships in the training set. Finally, we propose a single, general, zero-phase MMSE interpolation filter to address computational complexity concerns of all learning algorithms. The idea arises from image processing analysis of machine learning techniques rather than the application of machine learning to image processing. In the development of the final filter, we analyze a general classification-based filtering scheme using polyphase representation. Because there are inherent similarities and considerable overlap between each class in such an approach, one zero-phase filter for all image content seems to logically follow as an adequate approximation that reduces the total number of computations to that of bicubic interpolation. Analyzing the frequency response, we can generate filters on-the-fly for arbitrary scaling factor...|$|E
