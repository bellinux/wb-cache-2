While {{in the ground}} effect, the high-pressure air under the craft was trapped, filling the entire area and thus providing a stable base.

[...] Historically: religious, cultural, environmental, sociopolitical and socioeconomic conditions created widespread utilitarian need and have provided artistic inspiration among the many tribal peoples and ethnic groups in Central Asia and Turkey. [...] Turks; nomadic or pastoral, agrarian or town dwellers, living in tents or in sumptuous houses in large cities, have protected themselves from the extremes of the cold weather by covering the floors, and sometimes walls and doorways, with carpets and rugs. The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, <b>ground</b> <b>cushions,</b> oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.|$|R

50|$|Placing {{the same}} wing near a surface {{such as the}} water or the ground {{has the effect of}} greatly {{increasing}} the aspect ratio, but without having the complications associated with a long and slender wing, so that the short stubs on an Ekranoplan can produce just as much lift as the much larger wing on a transport aircraft, though it can only do this when close to the earth's surface. Once sufficient speed has built up, some GEVs may be capable of leaving ground effect and functioning as normal aircraft until they approach their destination. The distinguishing characteristic is that they are unable to land or take off without a significant amount of help from the <b>ground</b> effect <b>cushion,</b> and cannot climb until they have reached a much higher speed.|$|R

50|$|The Margarodidae or <b>ground</b> pearls (cottony <b>cushion</b> scales, giant coccids, giant scale insects) are {{a family}} of scale insects within the {{superfamily}} Coccoidea. Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus Porphyrophora) and the original ground pearl genus, Margarodes. Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first. Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century. Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae. The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae sensu stricto or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.|$|R

To her dismay she continues to fail at this and she takes an extremely close look when she finds herself gliding through the air in an unknown world. She mentions how it was December at her previous whereabouts and how in Needle's Eye World it seemed to have a pleasant summer-ish feel to the place. When she finally falls to the <b>ground</b> she is <b>cushioned</b> by a haystack. When she emerges, she hears a distant call for [...] "'elp". Alice soon discovers that they were the small whimpers of a Country Mouse, who believes that she is a comet. The Country mouse hereafter befriends Alice and informs her that she is not in a haystack, but an A-stack, or rather a messy pile of A's. She spots a few spelling bees, makes her way out of the haystack and continues in the direction of which she recalls seeing a beach from when she was flying.|$|R

[...] She sits directly on the <b>ground</b> without a <b>cushion</b> between herself and the ground, to better communicate the theme of her relationship to the earth. The grass directly below the figure is green, which sharply contrasts to the grassless ground surrounding her, although the green is now darker and less visible than it was originally. [...] Joseph has a higher position in the image compared to Mary, perhaps {{as the head of the}} family, although this is an unusual feature in compositions of the Holy Family. Mary is located between his legs, as if he is protecting her. There is some debate as to whether Mary is receiving the Christ child from Joseph or vice versa. [...] Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, is very commonly included in Florentine works depicting the Madonna and Child. He is in the middle-ground of the painting, between the Holy Family and the background. The elements around the family include plants and perhaps water.|$|R

On both volcanoes a total of 117 vegetation phytosociological relevees were made along the altitudinal gradient. They were clustered according to a classification analysis. The syntaxonomic scheme of the different units is presented and discussed.

40|$|Beware {{the hype}} – springy soles won’t make you run much faster Springy soles, stiffer shoes, {{lightweight}} materials. When does shoe design give some runners an unfair advantage? from www. shutterstock. com Glen Lichtwark, The University of Queensland; Dominic Farris, The University of Queensland, and Luke A Kelly, The University of Queensland Most runners believe a good pair of running shoes {{is worth the}} investment. But advances in running shoe technology have sparked debate about whether shoes help you run faster. Can they really allow marathon runners to break the elusive two-hour barrier, a challenge set {{to take place in}} Italy this weekend? Or can newer shoes help you improve your personal best? If they do, can we class these shoes as “performance enhancing” technologies that give runners an unfair advantage? Light shoes, better performance The weight of your running shoes can {{have a significant impact on}} running performance. As shoes get heavier, muscles use more energy to move your feet, causing you to fatigue earlier, reducing your running performance. Advances in materials technology have allowed running shoes to get lighter and lighter. Premium running shoes weigh on average 250 to 340 grams each, while the controversial Nike Zoom Vaporfly Elite tips the scales at just 184 grams. If shoe weight is so important, why not run barefoot? Running barefoot requires energy to be absorbed by the muscles of the legs and feet when the foot hits the <b>ground.</b> Shoe <b>cushioning</b> can alleviate some of that. However, adding cushioning also increases shoe weight. So, there is a trade-off between the benefit of cushioning and the detrimental effects of added weight. A recent study found running in shoes each weighing 211 grams resulted in the same energy consumed for a given running distance (called running economy) as running barefoot. And running barefoot on a treadmill, that provides the same cushioning as shoes (without adding weight to the feet), produced a small (1. 6...|$|R
40|$|The uniquely {{designed}} limbs of the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, support {{the weight of}} the largest terrestrial animal. Besides other morphological peculiarities, the feet are equipped with large subcutaneous cushions which {{play an important role in}} distributing forces during weight bearing and in storing or absorbing mechanical forces. Although the cushions have been discussed in the literature and captive elephants, in particular, are frequently affected by foot disorders, precise morphological data are sparse. The cushions in the feet of African elephants were examined by means of standard anatomical and histological techniques, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In both the forelimb and the hindlimb a 6 th ray, the prepollex or prehallux, is present. These cartilaginous rods support the metacarpal or metatarsal compartment of the cushions. None of the rays touches the <b>ground</b> directly. The <b>cushions</b> consist of sheets or strands of fibrous connective tissue forming larger metacarpal/metatarsal and digital compartments and smaller chambers which were filled with adipose tissue. The compartments are situated between tarsal, metatarsal, metacarpal bones, proximal phalanges or other structures of the locomotor apparatus covering the bones palmarly/plantarly and the thick sole skin. Within the cushions, collagen, reticulin and elastic fibres are found. In the main parts, vascular supply is good and numerous nerves course within the entire cushion. Vater–Pacinian corpuscles are embedded within the collagenous tissue of the cushions and within the dermis. Meissner corpuscles are found in the dermal papillae of the foot skin. The micromorphology of elephant feet cushions resembles that of digital cushions in cattle or of the foot pads in humans but not that of digital cushions in horses. Besides their important mechanical properties, foot cushions in elephants seem to be very sensitive structures...|$|R

Syntaxonomically new is the class Drabo jorullensis-Calama-grostietea tolucensis, which includes herbaceous formations dominated by tussock grasses, <b>ground</b> rosettes and <b>cushions</b> growing on Andosols and Lithosols. This class includes the orders Festucetalia lividae (ord. nov.) and Calamagrostietalia tolucensis. The first is located above 4150 m, and colonizes umbric Lithosols; the latter type of grassland, dense zacatonal formations, is present between about 3950 and 4150 m, and preferably on Andosols. The first order includes the alliance Plantagino tolucensis-Festucion lividae (all. nov.). The vegetation of this alliance is distributed on gentle slopes and almost level grounds with intense cryoturbation. This alliance comprises two associations, one of which is the new association Drabo nivicolae-Plantaginetum tolucensis. The pioneer vegetation consists of small tussocks and rosettes, and occurs in zones of colluvial accumulation and wind swept passes. It is restricted to Nevado de Toluca. The second order includes the new alliance Lupinomontani-calamagrostion tolucensis, which comprises the zacatonal associations above the pine transition zones of Pinus hartwegii. One out of four, the newly described association Lupino mexicani-Calamagrostietum tolucensis, is developed on slopes above the upper limit of these pine forests, only at Nevado de Toluca. A total of 22 families, 42 genera and 61 species of vascular plants are presented. The more representative families are Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae y Poaceae; among the genera are: Arenaria, Calamagrostis, Draba, Festuca, Senecio y Trisetum. Among the species with a wide range are: Arenaria bryoides, Calamagrostis tolucensis, Draba jorullensis, Senecio procumbens and Trisetum spicatum. More genera and species are documented from Nevado de Toluca than from Popocatepetl, due to historic-geological, edaphic, topographic and perturbation differences. The physiognomically dominant growth forms are the tussocks. The xerophytic aspect of the alpine vegetation on these volcanoes is determined by low temperatures during the largest part of the year, and by dryness which is reflected by the sheath of dry leaves of the tussocks. There is no arbustive fringe of transition among the sand paths limiting the high monotonous coniferous Pinus hartwegii forest and the "zacatonal alpino"...|$|R
