For this purpose each subscriber's line termination was examined {{for a period of}} 280 microseconds every 224 milliseconds, a process known as scanning. Junctions were scanned at eight times this rate. The scanning was carried out by a magnetic drum, each track of which is divided into 100 sections or words, one for each line. Parallel tracks were used for each 100 lines, one track providing the permanent (IDF) information (that is, directory number and class of service), another track gave a semi-permanent information (that is, whether the line was already engaged or parked because of PG conditions). Since the tracks are switched in sequence the information relating to each line could be read sequentially as the drum rotated, the angular position of the word together with the track number defining the equipment position that is, the line apparatus number of the line being scanned. The groups of 800 lines (junctions and subscribers) at Highgate Wood were divided into eight sub-groups, one sub-group for each track of the drum. In each sub-group the line units was arranged in ten columns of ten rows so that any line position could be defined by a ZXY code, Z for the <b>sub-group,</b> <b>X</b> for the column and Y for the rows.|$|R

Donnellan’s work is mainly {{in the philosophy of}} language, with an emphasis on the connections between semantics and pragmatics. His most influential work was his 1966 paper “Reference and Definite Descriptions”. In this paper, he challenges the canonical view, due to Bertrand Russell, about definite descriptions. Russell had argued that the proper semantic treatment of a definite description such as “the present king of France ” was quantificational. Thus, a sentence like “the present king of France is bald ” should be analyzed as “There exists one and only one <b>entity</b> <b>x</b> that is the present king of France, and x is bald”. Donnellan argues that in natural languages, there are actually two different kinds of uses of definite descriptions. Russell’s analysis picks out the “attributive ” use of definite descriptions. When we use a definite description (“the F”) this way, we mean to make statements about the unique <b>entity</b> <b>x</b> that is F. However, Donnellan notes that we also sometimes use definite descriptions “referentially ” to pick out a given entity and say something about it.

40|$|The {{universe}} {{in which we}} will be operating will be called a distributed computing environment. It consists of a finite collection E of computational entities communicating by means of messages. Entities communicate with other entities to achieve a common goal; for example, to perform a given task, to compute the solution to a problem, to satisfy a request either from the user (i. e., outside the environment) or from other entities. In this chapter, we will examine this {{universe in}} some detail. 1. 1 ENTITIES The computational unit of a distributed computing environment is called an entity. Depending on the system being modeled by the environment, an entity could correspond to a process, a processor, a switch, an agent, and so forth in the system. Capabilities Each <b>entity</b> <b>x</b> ∈ E is endowed with local (i. e., private and nonshared) memory Mx. The capabilities of x include access (storage and retrieval) to local memory, local processing, and communication (preparation, transmission, and reception of messages). Local memory includes a set of defined registers whose values are always initially defined; among them are the status register (denoted by status(x)) and the input value register (denoted by value(x)). The register status(x) takes values from a finite set of system states S; the examples of such values are “Idle, ” “Processing,” “Waiting,” [...] . and so forth. In addition, each <b>entity</b> <b>x</b> ∈ E has available a local alarm clock cx which it can set and reset (turn off).

40|$|Abstract. Referential {{qualities are}} qualities of an entity taken with ref-erence to another entity. For example the {{vulnerability}} of a coast to sea level rise. In contrast to most non-relational qualities which only depend on their host, referential qualities require a referent additional to their host, i. e. a quality Q of an <b>entity</b> <b>X</b> taken with reference to another en-tity R. These qualities occur frequently in ecological systems, which make concepts from these systems challenging to model in formal ontology. In this paper, we discuss exemplary resilience, vulnerability and affordance as qualities of an entity taken with reference to an external factor. We suggest an ontology design pattern for referential qualities. The design pattern is anchored in the foundational ontology DOLCE and evaluated using implementations for the notions affordance, resilience and vulner-ability. ...|$|R

For example, phonemic analysis takes phones with decidedly different phonetic realizations (e. g. aspirated vs. unaspirated stops in English) and treats them as the same at the phonemic level if their distribution does not overlap. But at the same time, segments {{that seem to be}} the same phonetically on the surface and even phonemically as well, e. g. the [d] of recede and the [d] of invade, might need to be treated as different from a morphophonemic standpoint, since, in this example, the former alternates with [] in the related noun recession whereas the latter alternates with [] in division, both nominal formation having ostensibly the same suffix.

We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and give rise to the connotative meanings. We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media. Comment: 11 pages, published in Proceedings of ACL 201...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{literature}} on dark energy (DE) model building we have learnt that cosmologies with variable cosmological parameters can mimic more traditional DE pictures exclusively based on scalar fields (e. g. quintessence and phantom). In a previous work we have illustrated this situation {{within the context}} of a renormalization group running cosmological term, Lambda. Here we analyze the possibility that both the cosmological term and the gravitational coupling, G, are running parameters within a more general framework (a variant of the so-called ``LXCDM models'') in which the DE fluid can be a mixture of a running Lambda and another dynamical <b>entity</b> <b>X</b> (the ``cosmon'') which may behave quintessence-like or phantom-like. We compute the effective EOS parameter, w, of this composite fluid and show that the LXCDM can mimic to a large extent the standard LCDM model while retaining features hinting at its potential composite nature (such as the smooth crossing of the cosmological constant boundary w=- 1). We further argue that the LXCDM models can cure the cosmological coincidence problem. All in all we suggest that future experimental studies on precision cosmology should take seriously the possibility that the DE fluid can be a composite medium whose dynamical features are partially caused and renormalized by the quantum running of the cosmological parameters.

For example, {{it is very difficult to}} accept that a strictly constant Lambda-term constitutes the ultimate explanation for the DE in our Universe. It is also hard to acquiesce in the idea that we accidentally happen to live in an epoch where the CC contributes an energy density value right in the ballpark of the rapidly diluting matter density. It should perhaps be more plausible to conceive that the vacuum energy, is actually a dynamical quantity as the Universe itself. More generally, we could even entertain the possibility that the total DE is in fact a mixture of vacuum energy and other dynamical components (e. g. fields, higher order terms in the effective action etc) which can be represented collectively by an effective <b>entity</b> <b>X</b> (dubbed the ``cosmon''). The ``cosmon'', therefore, acts as a dynamical DE component different from the vacuum energy. While it can actually behave phantom-like by itself, the overall DE fluid may effectively appear as standard quintessence, or even mimic at present an almost exact CC behavior. Thanks to the versatility of such cosmic fluid we can show that a composite DE system of this sort (``LXCDM'') may have a key to resolving the mysterious coincidence problem.
