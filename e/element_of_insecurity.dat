The film premiered at the Glasgow Film Theatre on 9 November 2011. The film received mixed reviews from critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. Duane Martin of Rogue Cinema said [...] "As mockumentaries go, this one is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the characters, and a lot of the story works quite well, but there are a couple of characters and bits of the story that either fall flat or just don’t work at all." [...] Nicholas Rapp of 'The Movie Banter' said [...] "What director Mark D. Ferguson and Andy S. McEwan got right was the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> within the documentary style. Their funds were creatively utilized, which is commendable." [...] The film was selected to appear in the spring showcase of the 2014 American Online Film Awards.|$|E

This paper briefly reviews the conceptual and methodological literature on food insecurity measurement, describes a particular method for distinguishing and measuring short-term food insecurity at the household level, and discusses ways of generalizing the method. The method developed enumerates the frequency and severity of strategies relied on by urban households when faced with a short-term insufficiency of food. This method goes beyond more commonly-used measures of caloric consumption to incorporate vulnerability <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> food <b>insecurity</b> as well as the deliberate actions of household decisionmakers when faced with food insufficiency.

40|$|The UNESCO listing as World Heritage Site {{confirms}} the outstanding {{qualities of the}} high-mountain region around the Great Aletsch Glacier. The region of the World Heritage Site now faces the responsibility to make these qualities visible and to preserve them for future generations. Consequently the qualities of the site must not be regarded in isolation but {{in the context of}} the entire region with its dynamics and developments. Regional monitoring is the observation and evaluation of temporal changes in target variables. It is thus an obligation towards UNESCO, who demands regular reports about the state of the listed World Heritage assets. It also allows statements about sustainable regional development and can be the basis for early recognition of threats to the outstanding qualities. Monitoring programmes face three major challenges: first, great care must be taken in defining the target qualities to be monitored or the monitoring would remain vague. Secondly, the selection of ideal indicators to describe these qualities is impeded by inadequate data quality and availability, compromises are inevitable. Thirdly, there is always an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> in the interpretation of the results as to what influences and determines the changes in the target qualities.

40|$|The {{people of}} Myanmar find their {{personal}} security and well-being {{threatened by the}} military authorities {{of the country and}} have no option but to leave their homeland and seek refuge in Thailand. Nevertheless, seen as the burden and <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> the refugees are often left unprotected or even expelled by the Thai authorities. The situation as such recalls what some observers shortly named “unwanted and unprotected”. The thesis focuses on the provisions of international human rights and refugee rights principles and traces the impact of international standards on the refugee problem situation. This research aims to assess the compliance with the international human rights and refugee principles in the Myanmar-Thailand case. Taking into account the particularity of this case, the aim has a twofold structure. On the one hand, it seeks to analyze the compliance with the international human rights principles in the Myanmar context. On the other hand, it needs to analyze the compliance with the international refugee and human rights standards of the Myanmar refugees in Thailand. Falling in-between the international law and international relations theories the compliance-based theory is employed to guide the analysis and help answer the fundamental question of this research: Why is compliance with the international human rights and refugee rights principles in the case of Myanmar and Thailand problematic...|$|E

The schools as a result have to keep up and adapt in order for the {{education}} to be up-to-date. This includes the technological developments. Many steps have been taken and mighty sums have been invested in order to keep up the pace – but are there any consequences from these kinds of investments? In this report I’m going to take a closer look on a recent addition to this phenomenon that were installed by means of a top-down approach and study the teachers and how they have adapted and view the change in their environment – namely the newly installed interactive writing-boards. The questions I will study include how the teachers express their view about the installation of the interactive writing-boards. If there are different kinds, groups, of opinions and if so, what causes such differences? My objective is to exemplify through an empirical study how teachers relate to the technology. This includes the pros and cons of the technology’s presence in the classroom. Through my results I have been able to conclude that there are indeed different categories of users. I have identified the User, the Positive None-user and the Critic. The main difference that separates the User from the None-user is the level of education in regards of handling the mechanical boards. The main benefit of the board is the variation it gives the lessons and the higher degree of material that can be shared to the class. The down-side, according to my results – other than the risk for technical problems that by many is seen as to add an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> to the planed lessons – is the severe lack of education the teachers have been given on the area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the impact <b>of</b> economic <b>insecurity</b> on {{the mental health}} of Australian adults. Taking microdata from the 2001 – 2011 HILDA panel survey, we develop a conceptually diverse set <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> measures and explore their relationships with the SF- 36 mental health index. By using fixed effects models that control for unobservable heterogeneity we produce estimates that correct for endogeneity more thoroughly than previous works. Our results show that exposure to economic risks has small but consistently detrimental mental health effects. The main contribution of the paper however comes from the breadth of risks that are found to be harmful. Job insecurity, financial dissatisfaction, reductions and volatility in income, an inability to meet standard expenditures and a lack of access to emergency funds all adversely affect health. This suggests that the common <b>element</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>insecurity</b> (rather than idiosyncratic phenomena associated with any specific risk) is likely to be hazardous. Our preferred estimates indicate that a standard deviation shock to economic insecurity lowers an individual 2 ̆ 7 s mental health score by about 1. 4 percentage points. If applied uniformly across the Australian population such a shock would increase the morbidity rate of mental disorders by about 1. 7...|$|R

The first component, structural and systemic causes for farmworker food insecurity, investigates how farmworker food insecurity is linked to international trade and immigration policies, as well as the historical exploitation of people of color in California's agricultural sector. Rather than simply chronicle a story of exploited laboring bodies, I expand upon on this narrative, exploring the ways that indigenous Oaxacan farmworkers, who for the most part come from a culture deeply rooted in food and agricultural practices, cope with food insecurity by utilizing their embodied agricultural and nutritional knowledge. I explore the linkages between their place in the food system as both producers and consumers, as they are simultaneously exploited for their labor, and creating coping mechanisms using their culinary and agricultural experience...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} the result of a minor field study which took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to contribute to the understanding and improvement of Security Sector Reform (SSR), which could be explained as a process of reformation applied in post-conflict scenarios aimed at the military, police and/or judicial sector which might be an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity,</b> particularly the police, and very particularly in post conflict scenarios where conflict resolution resulted in a divided police force, by using the BiH as a case study. We have used the theoretical framework/process of SSR and more specifically the part of SSR which touches upon police reform. However, SSR entails reformation of the security sector including military-, police- and judicial sectors, as mentioned our focus will be the police sector. This serving as a foundation for the thesis, we asked the following questions; Taking the point of departure in the Dayton Accords and its complex power sharing structure, which are the underlying factors/reasons why the Security Sector Reformation of the police force has been so problematic and why is there such inability to reach an agreement on this issue, especially in terms of structure? In terms of methodology, this is a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews in combination with previous research. Concluding remarks, progress has been made, however, the reformation of the police is to a large extent dependent on the political will not to do so, not much indicate a change related to this. The status of the BiH police force continues to be de-centralized in terms of structure due to the Dayton Accords which has still serves a fertile ground for the continuation of inefficiency, especially in terms of cooperation, information exchange, administrative issues, war-criminals within the police etc related to the different police forces...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{conceptual}} and analytical foundation for a discussion about the future shape of security arrangements in the Persian Gulf. The Persian Gulf is a regiion whose strategic and economic characteristics have strengthened its vital significance to all littoral states as well as the entire world's economy and political life. Its significant geopolitical situation, in addition to its dominant position as an energy source and gateway for global energy has caused this region to be a worthy rival to outside powers, particularly the West, while also being the most unstable and chaotic of any world region. Therefore the objective of this thesis has been to provide a security model for the Persian Gulf that address the need for a stable and peaceful structure of relationships which will provide security for all individual littoral states, as well as assuring the interests of the external powers. The thesis' hypothesis of cooperation as the only possible basis for a comprehensive strategy for peace and stability in this region has been substantiated by employing a variety of conceptual and analytical tools to understand the reasons for the failure of security models 'in the Persian Gulf and to confront the huge obstacles to a security system for this region. The relevance of this model is supported by the modem global political landscape, most especially the events that have occurred since the end of the 11 Cold War, in addition to various successful cooperation models that are to be found in other regions of the globe, e. g. the EU. This is assisted by the unprecedented opportunity for regional cooperation and the conditions for the creation of new security arrangements in the Persian Gulf and beyond that have been created since the downfall of Saddam's regime in 2003, which was one <b>of</b> the major <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> in this region. To this end, this study has analysed various security models in this significant geopolitical region in the world since 1962, with special reference to Iran's foreign policy. Particular reference has been made to Iran because of its geostrategic and geopolitical situation and as the hegemonic power in the Persian Gulf, which regardless its political regimes, it has great national and security concerns and plays a determinant role in peace and security of the region. With emphasis on dialogue as the best solution to the regional security problems in the Persian Gulf, this study has come up with a pyramid security model on the basis of the region's geopolitical realities which emphasisesth e need for domestic reforms as well as interaction and cooperation and a balance of interests between all regional and non-regional players...|$|R

The regression models show that social integration and smaller differences between households and neighbourhoods in terms of income and class are associated with greater perceptions <b>of</b> <b>insecurity.</b> The analysis therefore suggests that perceptions <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> are higher in Scotland than in Iceland because Iceland’s population is more homogeneous, with stronger social integration, less pronounced class and income differentials, and less polarization between neighbourhoods.

5000|$|Insurance is {{the result}} of man’s efforts to create {{financial}} security in the face of dangers to his life, person and estate. A typical desire of a man is to form and develop his estate .... The object of forming and developing an estate may, however, be thwarted by dangers to which his present and future position is exposed: if these materialise they may bring about undesirable consequences which may affect his estate immediately or in the future. Even while a danger is still remote it creates an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, whether in relation to its actual occurrence, the exact time of its occurrence, or the extent of its undesirable consequences. This <b>element</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty creates <b>insecurity.</b> Accordingly, it may be said that man’s need for security arises from the tension between his desire to form and develop his estate, on the one hand, and the dangers threatening to thwart that desire, on the other. The most effective and obvious way of achieving security is to take direct precautionary measures against imminent or potential harm .... One of the most satisfactory general methods of creating financial security against risks therefore seems to be that of spreading the risk among a number of persons all exposed to the same risk and all prepared to make a relatively negligible contribution towards neutralising the detrimental effects of this risk which may materialise for any one or more of their number.

This exploration adopts {{an approach to}} critical security that emphasises the play of identity and culture in the apprehension <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> understood primarily in existential terms.

In adopting this approach, this study provides a more sophisticated avenue by which we can better understand the sources <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> for the peoples of this region. The study thus focuses upon the apprehension <b>of</b> <b>insecurity</b> derived from demographic pressures, resource limitations, ecological degradation, food politics, identificatory challenges, health threats, and political change.
