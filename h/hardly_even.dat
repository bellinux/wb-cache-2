5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|It was Titiev that White {{brought to}} Michigan {{as a second}} {{professor}} in 1936. As a student of White—perhaps {{his status as a}} Russian immigrant was also salient—Titiev suited White perfectly. However, during the Second World War, Titiev took part in the war effort by studying Japan. Perhaps this upset the socialist White—in any case by war's end White had broken with Titiev and the two were <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> on speaking terms. More faculty were not hired until after the war, when the two-man department was expanded. This, compounded by the foundation by Titiev of the East Asian Studies Program and the import of scholars like Richard K. Beardsley into the department, created a split on which most professors fell one way or another.|$|E

I shivered when I went back to the book-case. My hands trembled: I wondered what was the matter with me.|$|R

500|$|George Bernard Shaw {{believed}} that Fielding was [...] "the greatest practising dramatist, {{with the single}} exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century." [...] However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, [...] "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial." [...] In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque. This critical approach {{is not limited to}} just Fielding, but to the whole field; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and [...] "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> read these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{their long}} {{national}} tour, the Music Machine {{returned to the}} studio to record their debut album, (Turn On) The Music Machine. Much to the disapproval of Bonniwell, his original material had to compete with dispensable cover versions of [...] "Cherry, Cherry", [...] "Taxman", [...] "See See Rider", and [...] "96 Tears", all chosen by their record label with an expectation that the well-known songs would increase record sales. One interpretation voluntarily selected by the band was a slow, moody, fuzz-laden arrangement of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] which bears a strong resemblance to Jimi Hendrix's later version. Bonniwell first heard the folk standard in 1962 at a club in Hermosa Beach, and was convinced the tune's tempo was too fast, as he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Wayfarers to record a slower version. He revisited the concept with altered lyrics after hearing Tim Rose's regionally successful rendition in early 1966. The throaty vocals, most evidently on [...] "Hey Joe", Bonniwell blames on recording [...] "the Turn On album after a 30-day tour. [...] Mark's fingers were literally bleeding. I could <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> speak, much less sing". Despite the album's shortcomings, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to reach number 75 on the Billboard 200. On January 21, 1967, a song taken from the album, [...] "The People in Me", was issued as the group's second single but stalled at number 66 nationally after the band's management angered radio executives for initially making the song exclusively available to a rival station.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cocea's {{literature}} and political controversy were also publicized outside Romania. From his refuge in Francoist Spain, Șeicaru made public his decades-long polemic with Cocea. His repeated talk about Cocea's immorality prompted literary historian Nicolae Manolescu to note a paradox: [...] "It is somewhat strange to see accusations of immorality being launched by people who, beyond their talent , {{do not even}} possess the most basic moral sense. The mere fact that the pamphlets they hurl at each other, like hogwash, have morality as their stake (never their own, always the other's), should make one think." [...] A French-language translation of Vinul de viață lungă was published by Jean de Palacio (Le Vin de longue vie, Le Serpent à Plumes, 2000). According to Romanian literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, the positive reception of such works in France [...] "would probably astound the Romanian literary environment, for whom Cocea <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> exists." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first American P-43A {{fighters were}} {{received}} by the 4th Air Group (21st - 24th Squadrons) in March 1942. [...] They retrained in Kunming, but for the new aircraft the pilots sequentially flew in small groups to India. [...] On 24 April the deputy commander of the 24th Squadron, Wu Zhenhua, crashed on the flight to Kunming. [...] On 12 May, Chen Lokun, the flight commander of the 24th Squadron was killed during a training flight, crashing into a tree during landing. [...] In July for unclear reasons the P-43 of the 4th Air Group commander, Zheng Shaoyu, caught fire {{in the air and}} the pilot was killed. [...] On 3 August 1942 during a training flight the deputy group commander Chen Sheng crashed. [...] A similar series of crashes accompanied the mastery by the Chinese of almost every new machine. [...] (It is notable that in Chinese sources the family names are given only of the perished commanders of various ranks, while the losses amongst the line pilots are <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> noted.) Concluding their conversion to the P-43A in early August 1942, the group returned to Chengdu.|$|E

2500|$|However, Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post {{found its}} [...] "sexed-up, party-oriented music - catchy but hardly groundbreaking" [...] and viewed the female lyrical {{perspective}} as minimal, stating [...] "There {{is plenty of}} fun happening on Battle of the Sexes, but still, the fellas clearly run it; the ladies are <b>hardly</b> <b>even</b> given a chance". NOWs Jason Richards gave the album 1 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Battle seems like {{an opportunity for the}} rapper to be more ignorant than ever". HipHopDX writer Kathy Iandoli gave it 2½ out of 5 stars and shared a similar sentiment, calling it [...] "an idea that lost momentum somewhere in the middle of its inception, and the result is a haphazard collection of cuts with no clear direction". Jesal Padania of RapReviews gave Battle of the Sexes a 5.5/10 rating and perceived its lyrics as [...] "instantly forgettable". The Harvard Crimsons Araba A. Appiagyei-Dankah gave it 2½ out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "When the album remembers to be a “battle” rather than an endless string of mildly memorable dance tunes and awkward sex songs, it presents a one-sided and misogynistic view of women". Despite noting that [...] "there really isn't much of a battle at all", Exclaim!s Neil Acharya commended Ludacris for his performance on the album, stating [...] "he seems content to do what he does best: make a pretty run-of-the-mill topic enjoyable with his off-kilter humour and exceptional flow". The Boston Globe writer Ken Capobianco called it [...] "a riotous, raucous set" [...] and wrote favorably of Ludacris's [...] "good-humoured" [...] lyrics. Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson gave Battle of the Sexes a B- rating and expressed a mixed response towards its themes, but commended Ludacris for his rapping, stating [...] "his gymnastic flow and irrepressible personality redeem more tracks than not".|$|E
