50|$|In 1922 a new {{staircase}} {{was added}} between the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the building, and the toilet block was reworked in 1924 {{to replace the}} original earth closets with water closets.|$|R
5000|$|The 03 T is [...] {{and has a}} low floor {{over half}} of its length. The <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections,</b> under which the wheels are placed, have a high floor; the middle section, between these, has a low floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} model {{featured a}} lightweight aluminum alloy frame, flatslide carbs, twin discs with 4-pot calipers, and 460 mm tyres both <b>front</b> and <b>rear.</b> To save weight, the designers specified an air-and-oil-cooled engine, {{rather than a}} water-cooled engine. The seat has separate <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> but from 1986 onwards all models have a one-piece seat.|$|R
50|$|The former Cooktown Hospital is {{constructed}} in timber. It has a two-storeyed front section facing west to May Street {{and a long}} single- storeyed wing attached at the rear and supported on steel stumps. The relationships of the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> are not original.|$|R
50|$|The Optare Soroco is a mini-coach body {{built for}} Mercedes-Benz chassis. It was {{recently}} overhauled {{to form the}} Soroco+ but this brand name seems to be abandoned. It featured a complete restyle of the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> {{as well as a}} restyled interior to give a luxury coach feel.|$|R
50|$|The livery {{was changed}} to NCT's {{two-tone}} green livery, with navy blue around the upper deck windscreen and <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the roof. The South Notts fleetname was dropped in 2014. Coinciding {{with the introduction of}} new vehicles, on 1 April 2015, a new livery of navy <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> with silver in between was introduced and the South Notts name reinstated.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls to}} the {{interior}} of the ground floor of the building are finished in plaster. The interior of the side walls have a blind arch configuration. The ceiling is narrow tongue and groove boarding with a timber cornice. The remains of a timber stair with a geometric pattern balustrade survive in the northeast corner of the ground floor of the front section. The stair flight up to the intermediate landing has been removed. The timber floors to the ground floor of the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the building have been replaced in concrete; there is evidence of these original floors surviving on the walls. A wide opening has been made in the adjoining wall between the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> and an original door opening exists under the stair. A strong room exists that opens into the front section of the ground floor but is situated in the <b>rear</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{produced}} [...] Contemporary Suzuki Swifts {{were available}} {{with only the}} four-cylinder, and only as a hatchback. The hatchback body configuration featured a three-inch lower liftover height compared to the previous generation model. Safety equipment included optional anti-lock brakes, safety cage construction with <b>deformable</b> <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> crush zones and five structural crossbars engineered to spread side impact loads throughout the cars structure, steel side impact door safety beams, and daytime running lights (the second generation Metro was the second GM car to offer DRLs in the United States—the 1995 Chevrolet Corsica was the first—and dual frontal airbags.|$|R
50|$|The paneled {{front door}} opens into a {{modified}} central hall divided into <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> separated by an arched entryway. The hallway divides two rooms of equal size on either side. This arrangement is replicated {{on the second}} floor. The rear wing has a kitchen on the ground level and a loft upstairs. Throughout the building, all finishes are original.|$|R
5000|$|The W 113 was {{the first}} sports car with a [...] "safety body," [...] based on Bela Barényi's {{extensive}} work on vehicle safety: It had a rigid passenger cell and designated crumple zones with impact-absorbing <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> built into the vehicle structure. The interior was [...] "rounded," [...] with all hard corners and edges removed, as in the W 111 sedan.|$|R
50|$|Classes E 91 and E 77 {{were very}} similar. The three-axle driven bogies had an inside frame. Each had a double motor driving its axles via a {{jackshaft}} and Winterthur diagonal side-rod drive (Schrägstangenantrieb). The superstructure was in three <b>sections.</b> The <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> {{each had a}} driver's cab and an engine room and were fixed to the bogies. The centre section was suspended between the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> and was articulated. The gangways between the individual sections of the engine room were protected by bellows; there were no dividing walls. The Bavarian locomotives could be easily told from their Silesian counterparts by the additional front door between the two cab windows (see photograph, right, of the Bavarian E 91 11, parked up in AW Frankfurt as a stationary transformer for the test shop. Unlike the E 91.9, it had air vents that can be clearly seen along {{the lower half of}} the sides).|$|R
50|$|The hall is a {{single-storeyed}} timber {{building with}} a steep pitch gable roof with asbestos cement tiles laid in a diamond pattern, roof vents and terracotta ridges and front finial. The east and west sides have a lower pitch, and the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> have lower hips. The building has concrete stumps, weatherboard sheeting to balustrade height and chamferboard above, with twin centrally pivoted hopper windows and coloured glass fanlights.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1988, the Person Racing Team {{began to}} modify their Nissan R86V {{in an attempt to}} keep the car competitive. They made {{aerodynamic}} changes to both <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the car and expanded the Nissan VG30ET V6 engine from 2.9 liters to 3.2 liters. The finished vehicle was rebranded a March 88S. A second 87G was modified in the same way and introduced later in the season.|$|R
50|$|RISE is a {{monocoque}} body system that combines an energy-absorbing <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> with a strong, rigid occupant cell to provide {{protection in the}} event of an accident. It features high tensile steel reinforcing bars in doors and energy-absorbing material in the side pillars and roof rails. The body structure is based on a one-piece shell with high levels of bending and torsional rigidity, which provides a steel cage for the safety of both the driver and passengers.|$|R
50|$|Hot Wheels {{begins with}} the player {{choosing}} a vehicle. The player can choose from one of several Hot Wheels vehicles, or can choose to create a custom vehicle instead. Custom vehicles are created by the player in a factory, where the player chooses {{the design of the}} vehicle's <b>front,</b> middle, and <b>rear</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the {{fuselage}} are loaded aboard {{one of the}} fleet in Hamburg in northern Germany, from where they are shipped to the United Kingdom. The wings, which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton in North Wales, are transported by barge on the River Dee to Mostyn docks, where the ship adds them to its cargo. The Ciudad de Cadiz went aground without cargo on sandbanks outside Mostyn in January 2013, when its moorings burst during high winds.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the house follows a typical Federal-period center hall plan, with the central hall divided into <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> (each with a staircase) by a doorway with a fanlight. There are two rooms {{on either side of}} the central hall. The woodwork in the public spaces is not particularly elaborate, with simple cornice moldings and fireplace surrounds, and flared moldings around the windows. The downstairs room of the ell served as Asa Gray's study, and includes a number of wood-frame display cases lining one wall.|$|R
50|$|The Unimog {{was quite}} successful, except as {{originally}} intended as an agricultural platform. Daimler-Benz produced a new vehicle in 1972, the MB Trac {{to be more}} oriented to larger scale mechanical farming. The new tractor crossed the Unimog technology of all-wheel drive and a power transmission to four large equal-sized wheels, {{with the appearance of}} a tractor: slim hood, behind it an angular, highly rising driver cab. In contrast to conventional tractors the cab is situated between the axles, similar to large four-wheel-drive tractors. There is no articulation between the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> as with larger tractors.|$|R
5000|$|The E25 Turbo concept {{sports car}} {{was built by}} BMW as a celebration for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. It was {{designed}} by Paul Bracq, with gullwing doors and {{was based on a}} modified 2002 chassis with a mid-mounted engine. [...] The Turbo featured a 200 hp turbocharged version of the engine from the BMW 2002, foam-filled <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> to absorb impact, side impact beams, a braking distance monitor utilizing radar, and a futuristic cockpit. The car developed [...] at 7100 rpm and reached 100 km/h from a standstill in 6.6 seconds. The top speed was 250 km/h.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, the Bungil Street school {{buildings}} were remodelled as Roma Government Complex accommodating the regional {{offices of the}} Education Department, Water Resources, Boating and Fishing and Forestry. In 1997, the reserve was subdivided into three lots with buildings on the <b>front</b> <b>section.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the land, comprising two lots, was sold to the Bungil Shire Council and the Uniting Church in 1997.|$|R
50|$|After its {{traditional}} markets declined during the 1990s, ČKD {{had to look}} for new sale opportunities. One potential customer was Manila, which {{wanted to build a}} new rapid transit line, the present-day MRT 3. In March 1996 the first three-car tram was tested in Prague under the number 0029. It was a development of the KT8D5, retaining its control, proportions, and the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> and, unlike the later production vehicles, designed for bidirectional operation. It remained in Prague, was used in October 1998 together with the Tatra-T5A5 prototype, no. 0013 and the T3 no. 6663 for various crash tests in the main workshop in Praha-Hostivař before being eventually scrapped.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental study of vibration control in a suspension equipped with independently controlled magnetorheolo-gical shock absorbers (MRAs) in <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections.</b> For research purposes, the pitch-plane suspension model with bounce and pitch mo-tions was considered. This suspension model was tested in open-loop and feedback system congurations under harmonic and square excita-tions. The experiments were conducted on a specially designed experi-mental setup with a data acquisition and control system congured in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results reveal eective-ness of MRAs for vibration suppression in the investigated suspension model. Key words: MR shock absorber, pitch-plane suspension model, LQ control 1...|$|R
5000|$|... 1966 Ford GT40. Development of the GT40 took 14 {{months to}} complete. It had a steel {{monocoque}} chassis built from 20 gauge (1.2mm) steel sheet folded and spot welded {{to form a}} chassis. It had fibreglass <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> body <b>sections,</b> fibreglass doors, and a 302 Ford V8 engine fitted to a ZF transaxle. The car was fitted with Girling four pot alloy calipers.|$|R
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the latter}} was Sh-Tandem {{designed}} by Pyotr Dmitrievich Grushin at the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). The design was a non-conventional tandem wing aeroplane. Even distribution of weight between <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> allowed for more ordinance to be installed in the airframe, including a rear gunner's turret. Additionally, lack of a vertical stabiliser allowed for wider field of fire. At {{the same time the}} tandem wing configuration allowed for the wings to be constructed of wood rather than metal and - at least in theory - was to give the new construction unprecedented manoeuvrability. Internally the fuselage was conventional for its times: a wooden monocoque, covered in plywood with some areas covered in bakelite.|$|R
50|$|The special-bodied taxi {{version was}} a spinoff of the T140, used {{specially}} as taxicabs in Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Panama and Singapore. It {{was first introduced}} with the 1.8-litre 1C diesel engine in January 1982 (CT140). In September an 1.8-litre LPG version (YT140) {{was added to the}} lineup. In addition to getting a new rear end and a taller, more upright roof line for a more comfortable rear seat, alterations were also made to the headlights and grille. While based on the T140, the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> took their design cues from the A60 Carina. In December 1986 the car underwent a light facelift, and the diesel option was upgraded to the 2-litre 2C version (CT141).|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} between the various versions were more marked, surrounding full <b>front</b> fascias and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> (including head and tail lights), as well as different interior colour themes. The middle and third row seats now had fore/aft sliders to increase flexibility and also adjustable backs. As with the first generation, a three seater bench seat was available in the third row, slotting into the standard third row seat runners, with back-lowering and tilt forward arrangements to increase boot space.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, {{parent company}} BSA {{produced}} the Ariel 3, a 49 cc automatic tricycle with a coupling between the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> frame <b>sections</b> allowing banking when cornering. The front half was hinged {{to the rear}} and could tilt into corners while keeping all three wheels on the ground. The design was licensed from George Wallis, of G.L.Wallis & Son, who had patented it in 1966. A small museum dedicated to the trike {{has been established in}} Bristol, England.|$|R
5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power {{with a sense of}} tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections,</b> while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|R

30|$|The “annular-shaped {{overlying}} zone” {{theory has}} been proposed. The stress-relief coefficient of the overlying strata is obtained from numerical simulation results (Yuan et al. 2011 a). The overlying zone can be considered an “annular-shaped fractured zone”, which is located at a certain height above the goaf and has a particular width and extends upward at a particular angle. The zone has the following characteristics: (i) it {{can be divided into}} three sections along the strike, i.e., <b>front,</b> center, and <b>rear.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>section</b> is adjacent to the working face and runs through the working face in the direction of dip, and is the main region where gas desorption and emission occur. The central section connects the <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> along two mining boundaries, and forms channels between these sections to allow large-scale gas flow. The <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> is near the cut and is smaller than the front section in size; (ii) the overlying annular-shaped fracture zone extends upward at a certain angle in the dip section, and the extension angles of the outward and inward boundaries are different; (iii) the overlying annular-shaped fracture zone is located in the strike section above the goaf at particular intervals and extends upward at a particular angle. The front range is larger than the rear range.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have <b>front</b> and <b>rear</b> <b>sections</b> that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|R
