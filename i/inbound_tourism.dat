30|$|The main {{result of}} the paper shows that sectoral growth of health {{services}} has encouraged <b>inbound</b> health <b>tourism.</b> Furthermore, it sends an important message to policy-makers about the developments of the health sector in providing potential as a service sector export. Another finding {{of the study is}} that there is no causality from number of health sector tourists to health sector expenditure in Turkey. This can be explained by the economic contribution of <b>inbound</b> health <b>tourism</b> to the whole sector, which is still limited. However, the increasing trend of <b>inbound</b> health <b>tourism</b> may provide a more important contribution in the years to come.|$|R

Estimates of {{the cost to the}} economy of extra public holidays, such as that allowed for the wedding, vary between £1.2billion and £6billion. The British government tourist authority VisitBritain predicted the wedding would trigger a tourism boom that would last several years, eventually pulling in an additional 4million visitors and generating £2billion. However, VisitBritain's head of research and forecasting, David Edwards, suggested to colleagues two days after the engagement was announced that the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on <b>inbound</b> <b>tourism.</b> He noted that the number of visitors to Britain was down significantly in July 1981, when Prince Charles and Diana were married, from the same period in other years, and also July 1986, when Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were married, was down from July 1985.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cruise ports {{emerged as}} an {{important}} sector for the economy of Turkey bordered on three sides by water. Forecasting cruise tourism demand ensures better planning, efficient preparation at the destination {{and it is the}} basis for elaboration of future plans. In the recent years, new techniques such as; artificial neural networks were employed for developing of the predictive models to estimate tourism demand. In this study, it is aimed to determine the forecasting method that provides the best performance when compared the forecast accuracy of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Generalized Regression neural network (GRNN) to estimate the monthly <b>inbound</b> cruise <b>tourism</b> demand to İzmir via the method giving best results. We used the total number of foreign cruise tourist arrivals as a measure of <b>inbound</b> cruise <b>tourism</b> demand and monthly cruise tourist arrivals to İzmir Cruise Port in the period of January 2005 ‐December 2013 were utilized to appropriate model. Experimental results showed that radial basis function (RBF) neural network outperforms multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the generalised regression neural networks (GRNN) in terms of forecasting accuracy. By the means of the obtained RBF neural network model, it has been forecasted the monthly <b>inbound</b> cruise <b>tourism</b> demand to İzmir for the year 2014...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{consequences}} of globalisation for Turkey, as well as in other emerging countries, has been an increasing trend in health tourism. Households have been considered choice the best option in terms of price and alternative possibilities while they have been solved their health problems. Previous studies have argued that the main drivers of the growth of <b>inbound</b> health <b>tourism</b> to developing countries are lower costs, shorter waiting periods, and better quality of care. This study aimed to test the effect of health and social service sector growth on the flow of <b>inbound</b> health <b>tourism</b> between 2004 :Q 1 and 2015 :Q 4 by employing Granger causality and Johansen cointegration approaches. Our findings suggested that there is a long-run Granger causality from domestic health and social work expenditures to health tourism income whereas this is non-existence in the opposite direction.|$|R

40|$|We {{employ the}} {{asymmetric}} {{version of the}} Granger causality test to assess how Australian <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>tourism</b> flows across 49 markets (countries) are driven by the sign-dependent variations in departure series or vice versa. A multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) model is also estimated to study the time-varying co-volatility between <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>tourism</b> growth rates. We find that rising co-volatility spillovers between <b>inbound</b> and outbound <b>tourism</b> are statistically significant {{for a number of}} markets. The six markets that are most susceptible to global shocks are China, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom. China is by far the largest of these markets and, except for the United Kingdom, both arrivals and departures for each of these countries represent growing markets for Australia. We present recommendations for policymakers and destination management organizations (DMOs) to assist in developing customized strategies targeting resilient inbound markets in order to optimize tourism performance and reduce potential losses in times of crisis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} marine ecosystem quality on <b>inbound</b> coastal <b>tourism</b> in the Baltic, North Sea, and Mediterranean countries. Given extensive empirical findings in ecological science, we use marine protected areas (MPAs) and the fraction of species that are shed in each country's exclusive economic zone that are overexploited or collapsed {{as a proxy for}} marine ecosystem quality. We use an autoregressive distributed lag model in a destination-origin panel set up. The empirical findings of this paper suggest that MPAs have a negative direct effect on tourism. However, this effect is reversed when the interaction terms with economic variables are included. Also, by using the fraction of species that are overexploited as an indicator of the deterioration of marine ecosystem quality, we find a considerable negative impact of this index on <b>inbound</b> coastal <b>tourism.</b> The short-term (current) impact of this index on tourism constitutes {{less than half of the}} long-term impact. Results provide valuable information for policy makers, suggesting that measures enhancing marine ecosystem quality should be considered in addition to conventional tourism policies focused on price...|$|R
