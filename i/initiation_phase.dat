25|$|RA {{primarily}} {{starts as}} a state of persistent cellular activation leading to autoimmunity and immune complexes in both joints and other organs where it manifests. The initial site of disease is the synovial membrane, where swelling and congestion leads to infiltration by immune cells. Three phases of progression of RA are an <b>initiation</b> <b>phase,</b> due to non-specific inflammation, an amplification phase, due to T cell activation and chronic inflammatory phase with tissue injury, due to cytokines IL–1, TNF-alpha and IL–6.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{coercion}} by perpetrators and traffickers {{involves the use}} of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of psychological stress induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics {{of coercion}} are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination. During the <b>initiation</b> <b>phase,</b> traffickers use foot-in-the-door techniques of persuasion to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This manipulation creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker. Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the tissue}} factor {{exposure}} path, initiation begins when cells are ruptured and expose tissue factor (TF). [...] Plasma Factor (f) VII binds to TF and sets off {{a chain reaction}} which activates fXa and fVa which bind to each other to produce thrombin which in turn activates platelets and fVIII. The platelets activate by binding to the damaged tissue in the <b>initiation</b> <b>phase,</b> and fibrin stabilizes the clot during the propagation phase.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{replication}} and RNA transcription both {{make use}} of base flipping. [...] DNA polymerase is an enzyme that carries out replication. [...] It {{can be thought of}} as a hand that grips the DNA single strand template. [...] As the template passes across the palm region of the polymerase, the template bases are flipped out of the helix and away from the dNTP binding site. [...] During transcription, RNA polymerase catalyzes RNA synthesis. [...] During the <b>initiation</b> <b>phase,</b> two bases in the -10 element flip out from the helix and into two pockets in RNA polymerase. [...] These new interactions stabilize the -10 element and promote the DNA strands to separate or melt.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after {{inflammation}} {{has been}} initiated, macrophages enter the scene and, if not {{controlled by the}} initial ambush of neutrophils and their tactics, the microbial invasion is faced with a second strike consisting of these leukocytes, along with lymphocytes. [...] Together, the cells of this second strike compose {{the bulk of the}} apical periodontitis lesion and serve {{an important role in the}} subsequent chronic phase of inflammation of apical periodontitis, as they can live for many months. [...] Some researchers posit that it must not be macrophages that are involved, as they could not appropriately discriminate between the varied array of opsonized entities as necessary, and that, in reality, the properties ascribed to the macrophage in the <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> of the inflammatory response actually belong to the lymphatic dendritic cell. [...] It is unclear, however, if the latter is a distinct population of cells or if it is merely a particularly specialized strain of macrophage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of mucositis can {{be divided}} into its 5 stages; including an <b>initiation</b> <b>phase,</b> a message generation phase, a signaling and amplification phase, an ulceration phase, and a healing phase. Different cytokines are responsible for the various stages. The <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> is caused by the production of free radicals caused by the chemo- or radio- therapy, which damages cell DNA. This causes the production of cell transcription factors such as NF-κB, which upregulates inflammatory cytokines, marking the beginning of the ulceration phase. Main inflammatory cytokines involved are IL-1b and TNF-alpha. In addition, bacteria-mediated innate immune signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ambiguously shapes chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage in the gastrointestinal tract. [...] During the restitution phase, epithelial cells migrate and begin re-epithelialization of the ulcers.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} show how an SBC works one can compare a simple call {{establishment}} sequence with a call establishment sequence with an SBC. [...] In the simplest session establishment sequence with only one proxy between the user agents the proxy’s task is to identify the callee’s location and forward the request to it. The proxy also adds a Via header with its own address to indicate the path that the response should traverse. The proxy does not change any dialog identification information present in the message such as the tag in the From header, the Call-Id or the Cseq. Proxies also do not alter any information in the SIP message bodies. Note that during the session <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> the user agents exchange SIP messages with the SDP bodies that include addresses at which the agents expect the media traffic. After successfully finishing the session <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> the user agents can exchange the media traffic directly between each other without {{the involvement of the}} proxy.|$|E

50|$|DnaA is {{a protein}} that {{activates}} initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. It is a replication initiation factor which promotes the unwinding of DNA at oriC. The {{onset of the}} <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> of DNA replication {{is determined by the}} concentration of DnaA. DnaA accumulates during growth and then triggers the initiation of replication. Replication begins with active DnaA binding to 9-mer (9-bp) repeats upstream of oriC. Binding of DnaA leads to strand separation at the 13-mer repeats. This binding causes the DNA to loop in preparation for melting open by the helicase DnaB.|$|E
50|$|At least 10 {{different}} enzymes or proteins {{participate in}} the <b>initiation</b> <b>phase</b> of replication. They open the DNA helix at the origin and establish a prepriming complex for subsequent reactions. The crucial component in the initiation process is the DnaA protein, {{a member of the}} AAA+ ATPase protein family (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities). Many AAA+ ATPases, including DnaA, form oligomers and hydrolyze ATP relatively slowly. This ATP hydrolysis acts as a switch mediating interconversion of the protein between two states. In the case of DnaA, the ATP-bound form is active and the ADP-bound form is inactive.|$|E
