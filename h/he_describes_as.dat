5|$|Churchill {{has written}} on American Indian history and culture, and speaks about {{genocide}} inflicted on {{the indigenous people}} of the Americas by European settlers and what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the repression of native peoples that continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Struggle for the Land (1993; reissued 2002) is a {{collection}} of essays in which Churchill chronicles what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the U.S. government's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians. He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface mining.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
50|$|Greene {{originally}} divided {{his fiction}} into two genres: thrillers (mystery and suspense books), such as The Ministry of Fear, which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> entertainments, often with notable philosophic edges; and literary works, such as The Power and the Glory, which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> novels, {{on which he}} thought his literary reputation was to be based.|$|R

5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E
5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E

They go shirtless and shoeless. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> them <b>as</b> pusillanimous in habitus, weak, but zealous in faith and spirit.|$|R
5|$|The band's 2009 summer tour {{began on}} July 18 in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Mile High Music Festival. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and {{a show on}} August 22 for the Epicenter Festival in Pomona, California. Their Tool Winter Tour played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at Ozzfest Japan on May 12, 2013. Meanwhile, Tool members have pursued their own musical projects. Keenan has toured {{extensively}} with Puscifer, which <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> involving a series of musical ideas {{he did not have}} an opportunity to explore with Tool or A Perfect Circle.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{interests}} in fashion and culture {{led him to}} make frequent visits to New York City—which <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city's status as a global fashion capital. He {{was present at the}} World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights. Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels, which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends.|$|E

25|$|According to Thomas L. Friedman, the Phalangist Damouri Brigade, which {{carried out}} the Sabra and Shatila {{massacre}} during the 1982 Lebanon War sought revenge {{not only for the}} assassination of Bashir Gemayel, but also for what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> past tribal killings of their own people by Palestinians, including those at Damour.|$|E

The parade commenced 20 minutes late at 10:50.

25|$|Pamina falls at Sarastro's {{feet and}} confesses that {{she tried to}} escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro {{receives}} her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.|$|E
25|$|In his 2008 {{review of}} the volume, Săndulescu noted that the text omitted {{important}} details from its author's life. Given the date of completion, <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> understandable that Cioculescu failed to mention facts about his anti-communist brother and his death in confinement, and believes it natural that the book does not include any detail about the critic's own affiliation with the anti-communist Dreptatea. However, he sees a bizarre tendency in that Amintiri skips over Cioculescu's time in Paris.|$|E

Hans has said he was partly inspired by observing floods in his home country of The Netherlands during his childhood.|$|R
5000|$|Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. Josh Harmon from Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 9/10. He praised the engaging combat mechanics, coherent story (which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a welcome shift for Call of Duty"), new mobility options, {{as well as}} in-depth specialisation and the multiplayer, which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> [...] "The deepest, most enjoyable and the most skill-based Call of Duty multiplayer to date". He also praised the futuristic gadgetry which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a feature that breathes {{new life into the}} franchise". However, he criticised the single-mission level design for being similar to the previous installments, as well as a predictable, disappointing plot twist, unimpressive co-operative mode and clumsy vehicle-involved single-player mission.|$|R
25|$|While {{it seemed}} {{baffling}} that a player of his quality {{was allowed to}} leave any Superleague team, Turner noted in 2012, had he not departed Irish shores, temporarily as it happened, {{he would never have}} enjoyed what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> his most enjoyable experience away from Ireland: winning the Swiss Division Two league title and MVP honors in 2004–05 with Vacallo. In 18 games for Vacallo, he averaged a league-leading 30.8 points, 12.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 5.5 steals and 2.8 blocks per game.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the support he gave to bilingual education during his early career, his book attacks what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> obstacles to assimilation, such as bilingual education, and urges Hispanics to eschew government solutions and adopt instead the cultural values that have made previous generations of American immigrants prosperous and successful. His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% {{of the population of}} the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} laws {{establishing}} no-fault divorce {{can be seen}} as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract. He states that {{it is not possible to}} form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other. He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the confiscation of their children.|$|E
