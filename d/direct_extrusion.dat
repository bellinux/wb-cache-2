25|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>{{extrusion}},</b> {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|E

40|$|Cytoplasmic free Mg 2 + concentration, [Mg 2 +]i, was {{measured}} in identified neuronal cell bodies of the suboesophageal ganglia of Helix aspersa, using Mg 2 +-selective micro-electrodes. In calibration solutions, the electrodes showed significant interference from K+, but not from Na+, or Ca 2 +, at concentrations found intracellularly. Therefore, in order to calibrate the electrodes properly, it was necessary first to obtain an accurate value for intracellular free K+ concentration [(K+]i). The mean value for [K+]i was 91 mM (S.

In seven experiments, which met stringent criteria for satisfactory impalement and electrode calibration, the mean [Mg 2 +]i was 0. 66 mM (S. E. of the mean +/- 0. 05 mM). The mean [Mg 2 +]i in cells that had spontaneous spike activity was {{not significantly different from}} that in quiescent cells.

Having good agreement between simulated and experimental results of two tested die setups (with and without welding chamber) the effect of temperature on length of charge-weld was evaluated. A main drawback of die setup without welding chamber is too short and, consequently, too week charge-weld. Since many extruded profiles need to be stretched after cooling, die setup without welding chamber is not applicable for commercial production. Application of die setup without – or with shallow – welding chamber is limited to flat profiles with simple and symmetrical geometry like round or rectangular bars where mixing of extruded material is not crucial for the profiles properties...|$|R
