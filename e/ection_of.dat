40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{argue that}} uncomputability and {{classical}} scepticism are both re <b>ections</b> <b>of</b> inductive underdetermination, so that Church's thesis and Hume's problem ought to receive equal emphasis in a balanced {{approach to the}} philosophy of induction. As an illustration of such an approach, we investigate how uncomputable the predictions of a hypothesis can be if the hypothesis is to be reliably investigated by a computable scienti c method. 1. RELATIONS OF IDEAS AND MATTERS OF FACT Following an ancient tradition, David Hume boldly divided the objects of inquiry into two kinds: relations of ideas and matters of fact (Hume, 1984). Relations of ideas embrace all mathematical and logical inquiry, whereas matters of fact are the principal concerns of empirical science and daily life. The view that mathematics concerns relations of ideas has two important consequences. First, mathematical questions can be answered independently of all empirical data and second, the ideas upon which such questions depend can be scanned all at once by the 's eye, &quot; resulting in certainty concerning their relations. After a brief discussion of this happy situation in mathematics...|$|R

To eciently manage a small number of reference environment maps, compared to the scene dimension, for each vertex of the reconstructed en-vironment we perform a ray tracing in a heighteld represen-tation of the scene. We control the frame rate by adaptative reconstruction of environment maps. We have implemented this approach, and the results show that it is ecient and scalable to many dynamic objects while maintaining inter-active frame rates...|$|R

As the conditions for classical treatment are well fulˇlled, {{this means that the}} classical results are much more accurate than the quantum one in Born approximation.

40|$|A {{common problem}} in {{displaying}} within-subject data {{is that of}} how to show confidence intervals that accurately re 2 ect the pattern of significant differences between conditions. The Cousineau-Morey method (Cousineau, 2005; Morey, 2008) is a widely used solution to this issue; however, this method only applies to experimental designs with only one repeated-measures factor (e. g., subjects). Many experimental designs in fields such as psycholinguistics and social psychology use crossed random effect designs where, e. g., there are repeated measures both for subjects and stimuli. For such designs, extant methods for showing within-subject intervals would require first aggregating over stimuli, and thus such intervals might be a less accurate re 2 <b>ection</b> <b>of</b> the statistical significance patterns if the data are actually analyzed using a method that takes both random effects into account (e. g., linear mixed-effects models). The present paper proposes {{an extension of the}} method described above to address this problem; the proposal is to scale the data using a mixed-effects model, rather than using the means from each subject, and then calculate confidence intervals from the data scaled thusly. Analysis of a sample of crossed random effect datasets reveals that intervals calculated using this method give a slightly more accurate re 2 <b>ection</b> <b>of</b> the pattern of statistical significance in the between-condition differences.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of the errors in the observables caused by the multipath propagation and the interferences is addressed. Two dierent estimators are derived by applying the max-imum likelihood (ML) principle to a signal model that assumes the reception <b>of</b> several re <b>ections</b> <b>of</b> the GNSS signal and that the spatial signatures of all the signals are arbitrary and unstructured. The rst estimator, which is a classical result since the noise is modeled as spatially white, {{is an extension of}} the well-known multipath estimating delay-lock-loop. The second estimator is derived by assuming that the spatial correlation matrix of the noise is unknown. This endows the estimator with interference cancelation capability, of which the rst estimator lacks. The second method constitutes a new result and its performance is always equal or better than that of the rst one. Moreover, we propose an approxima-tion of the estimator for the correlated-noise case that provides the same performance as the original criterion. This approximation may allow the use of a computationally simple optimization algorithm that was only applicable in the white-noise case. ...|$|R

The main topic is {{the design of a}} monolithic transmitter in SiGe bipolar technology, for weather radar application at an operating frequency around 94 GHz.

The transmitter input receives a single-ended reference signal at 23. 5 GHz, with a power of 0 dBm on a single-ended input impedance of 50 Ω.

To analyze burst activity in an insect system, grasshopper auditory receptor neurons {{were recorded in}} vivo for several distinct stimulus types. The experimental data show that both burst probability and burst characteristics are strongly infl uenced by temporal modulations of the acoustic stimulus.

We study this interaction quantitatively and observe that bursts containing {{a certain number of}} spikes occur shortly after stimulus defl <b>ections</b> <b>of</b> specifi c intensity and duration.
