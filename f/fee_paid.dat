40|$|In {{the face}} of informational asymmetry, REIT equity investors may bear the costs of agency. Hence, it is in shareholders' {{interests}} to pay incentive fees to induce managers to utilize their superior information and to take suitable actions that reduce these costs. In this paper, the relation between financial performance and <b>fees</b> <b>paid,</b> and between <b>fees</b> <b>paid</b> and contractual incentives, are examined to determine whether equityholder interests are being served by the decisions of REIT managers. The data reveal that <b>fees</b> <b>paid</b> and financial performance are positively related, indicating that financial performance is at least partially endogenous with respect to managerial action. Moreover, the evidence also suggests that the industry fee structure {{has changed over the}} period in a manner that appears to have reduced the agency costs borne by equityholders, {{and by the end of}} the sample period the <b>fees</b> <b>paid</b> in general seem to reflect incentives that are consistent with the wealth maximization goal of equityholders.
