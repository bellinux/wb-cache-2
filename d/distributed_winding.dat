50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with <b>distributed</b> <b>winding</b> {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with <b>distributed</b> <b>winding</b> can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2012, U. S. <b>wind</b> {{turbines}} in <b>distributed</b> applications {{reached a}} 10 -year cumulative installed capacity of more than 812 MW from more than 69, 000 units across all 50 states. In 2012 alone, nearly 3, 800 wind turbines totaling 175 MW of <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> capacity were documented in 40 states and in the U. S. Virgin Islands, with 138 MW using utility-scale turbines (i. e., greater than 1 MW in size), 19 MW using mid-size turbines (i. e., 101 kW to 1 MW in size), and 18. 4 MW using small turbines (i. e., up to 100 kW in size). <b>Distributed</b> <b>wind</b> is {{defined in terms of}} technology application based on a wind project’s location relative to end-use and power-distribution infrastructure, rather than on technology size or project size. <b>Distributed</b> <b>wind</b> systems are either connected on the customer side of the meter (to meet the onsite load) or directly to distribution or micro grids (to support grid operations or offset large loads nearby). Estimated capacity-weighted average costs for 2012 U. S. <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> installations was $ 2, 540 /kW for utility-scale wind turbines, $ 2, 810 /kW for mid-sized wind turbines, and $ 6, 960 /kW for newly manufactured (domestic and imported) small wind turbines. An emerging trend observed in 2012 was an increased use of refurbished turbines. The estimated capacity-weighted average cost of refurbished small wind turbines installed in 2012 was $ 4, 080 /kW. As a result of multiple projects using utility-scale turbines, Iowa deployed the most new overall <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> capacity, 37 MW, in 2012. Nevada deployed the most small wind capacity in 2012, with nearly 8 MW of small wind turbines installed in distributed applications. In the case of mid-size turbines, Ohio led all states in 2012 with 4. 9 MW installed in distributed applications. State and federal policies and incentives continued to play a substantial {{role in the development of}} <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> projects. In 2012, U. S. Treasury Section 1603 payments and grants and loans from the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America Program were the main sources of federal funding for <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> projects. State and local funding varied across the country, from rebates to loans, tax credits, and other incentives. Reducing utility bills and hedging against potentially rising electricity rates remain drivers of <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> installations. In 2012, other drivers included taking advantage of the expiring U. S. Treasury Section 1603 program and a prosperous year for farmers. While 2012 saw a large addition of <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> capacity, considerable barriers and challenges remain, such as a weak domestic economy, inconsistent state incentives, and very competitive solar photovoltaic and natural gas prices. The industry remains committed to improving the <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> marketplace by advancing the third-party certification process and introducing alternative financing models, such as third-party power purchase agreements and lease-to-own agreements more typical in the solar photovoltaic market.

40|$|The {{concentrated}} winding is proposed {{to replace the}} <b>distributed</b> <b>winding</b> due to the advantages in a manufacturing process. It is easily wounded by a machine in the former and the impregmentation process that {{can be carried out}} separately for each individual coil. These advantages can lead to the automation process in winding processes, reduced time and cost in generator manufacturing. One of the problems of the {{concentrated winding}} generator is eddy current losses {{due to the fact that}} air gap flux in the concentrated winding contains much more harmonics compared to the <b>distributed</b> <b>winding.</b> These losses should be kept in within the acceptable level of heat removing capability of the generator. Otherwise, higher temperature of magnet could influences the remanence flux of the permanent magnet.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the status, restrainers, drivers, and estimated development potential of mid-scale (10 kW to 5000 kW) <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> projects. This {{segment of the}} wind market has not enjoyed the same growth that central-station wind has experienced. The purpose of this report is to analyze why, and to assess the market potential for this technology under current market and policy conditions. As discussed in section 2, {{one of the most}} significant barriers to the development of <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> is a general scarcity of turbine choices and turbine inventory available for purchase. Most turbine manufacturers have scaled back their involvement in the mid-scale market segments in favor of larger turbines suitable for large, central-station wind farms. Those distributed-scale turbines that are available are often relatively expensive (on a $/kW basis), hard to order in single units or small lots, and suffer from long delivery delays. Section 3 discusses various other factors—both positive and negative—that affect the viability of <b>distributed</b> <b>wind.</b> In addition to the product scarcity described in section 2, <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> is challenged by relatively poor productivity (compared with more modern large turbines), siting issues, burdensome interconnection rules, aesthetic concerns, and fragmented state rules regarding net metering. Several other factors favor distributed wind: areas of high and rising retail electricity prices, increasingly favorable public policies, and greater community interest in the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy. As examined in section 4, the study evaluated the economic potential for <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> in the contiguous United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The analysis began with a GIS screening process to eliminate areas that are technically impractical for <b>distributed</b> <b>wind.</b> Sites were eliminated in areas where: •	Elevation was too high; •	Slope was too steep; •	Population density was too great; •	Wind Power Class was less than 2; and •	Areas legally excluded from wind-power development, such as national parks. After screening out ineligible sites, more than 3. 6 million surviving sites were evaluated to determine whether <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> would be financially feasible. Certain customer types were excluded from the study, such as agricultural, construction companies, and military facilities, because they lacked data necessary for the analysis. The financial model considered: •	Wind resources; •	Wholesale and retail power prices; •	Renewable Energy Credit (REC) prices; •	Customer type (community wind, commercial, industrial, or public facility); •	Project size; •	Turbine technical and financial characteristics; •	Onsite and offsite energy use; and •	Incentives. The results varied significantly by customer class. Overall, the study showed that 67, 100 out of the 3, 611, 655 sites/areas that were analyzed for economic viability yielded a positive net present value under current market conditions and policies and including all applicable state and federal incentives. To assess the potential of new technology, two virtual wind turbines—the NREL 250 and NREL 500 —were included in the analysis. These virtual turbines were compared to existing 250 kW and 500 kW turbines. Overall, the study showed that 204, 677 sites analyzed had positive net present values with the virtual turbines compared with 10, 407 economically successful projects with existing 250 kW and 500 kW turbines. These numbers do not include the application of capped state and federal incentives. The following crucial changes could expand <b>distributed</b> <b>wind</b> development into the future. •	Improvements in technology; •	Reductions in cost; •	Greater productivity at lower wind speeds; and •	Greater policy support...|$|R

While {{the control of}} α-β currents is crucial for flux and torque regulation, control of x-y currents is important for machine/converter asymmetry and dead-time effect compensation. In this paper, an attempt is made to provide a physically meaningful insight into current control of a six-phase machine, by showing that the fictitious x-y currents can be physically interpreted as the circulating currents between the two three-phase windings.
