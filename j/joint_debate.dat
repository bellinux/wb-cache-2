500|$|True to his word, Buckner {{never again}} met Bradley in a <b>joint</b> <b>debate.</b> Rumors began to {{circulate}} that Buckner {{was afraid to}} meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors. The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and State Senator Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state. The Democratic Henderson Gleaner was also critical, opining [...] "We {{should be ashamed of}} ourselves." [...] Throughout the state, Bradley hammered the issue of the blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury. Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's black voters. His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer James [...] "Honest Dick" [...] Tate fled with $250,000 from the state treasury. He was never found.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} debate, held in Hopkinsville, Hardin countered Bradley's {{offensive}} against {{him on the}} money issue by charging that {{the election of a}} Republican would lead to [...] "Negro domination" [...] of the state. This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth <b>joint</b> <b>debate,</b> held August 30 at Eminence, some members of the audience began to heckle Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart his opening statement four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates {{as a result of the}} incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order to dodge the racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt to dodge the racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for Populist Thomas S. Pettit instead.|$|E

He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 20th is received. I suppose {{as good or}} {{even better}} men than I {{may have been in}} American or Know-Nothing lodges; but in point of fact, I never was in one at Quincy or elsewhere. I was never in Quincy but one day and two nights while Know-Nothing lodges were in existence, and you were with me that day and both those nights. I had never been there before in my life, and never afterward, till the <b>joint</b> <b>debate</b> with Douglas in 1858. It was in 1854 when I spoke in some hall there, and after the speaking, you, with others, took me to an oyster-saloon, passed an hour there, and you walked with me to, and parted with me at, the Quincy House, quite late at night. I left by stage for Naples before {{daylight}} in the morning, having come in by the same route after dark the evening, previous to the speaking, when I found you waiting at the Quincy House to meet me. A few days after I was there, Richardson, as I understood, started this same story about my having been in a Know-Nothing lodge. When I heard of the charge, as I did soon after; I taxed my recollection for some incident which could have suggested it; and I remembered that on parting with you the last night I went {{to the office of the}} hotel to take my stage-passage for the morning, was told that no stage-office for that line was kept there, and that I must see the driver before retiring, to insure his calling for me in the morning; and a servant was sent with me to find the driver, who, after taking me a square or two, stopped me, and stepped perhaps a dozen steps farther, and in my hearing called to some one, who answered him, apparently from the upper part of a building, and promised to call with the stage for me at the Quincy House. I returned, and went to bed, and before day the stage called and took me. This is all.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} global labour history (GLH) and global {{economic}} history {{have much to}} offer each other. GLH {{would do well to}} raise sweeping questions - for instance about the origins of global inequality - engage more with theory, and increasingly use quantitative methods. Instead of seeing labour and labour relations as historical phenomena to be explained, they can serve as important explanatory variables in historical analyses of economic development and divergence. In turn, economic historians have much to gain from the recent insights of global labour historians. GLH offers a more inclusive and variable usage of the concept of labour, abandoning, as it does, the often narrow focus on male wage labour in the analyses of many economic historians. Moreover, GLH helps to overcome thinking in binary categories, such as free and unfree labour. Ultimately, both fields will benefit from engaging in <b>joint</b> <b>debates</b> and theories, and from collaboration in collecting and analysing big data. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 1631 and 1632 the Senate {{first used}} {{its right to}} veto {{constitutional}} acts adopted by the Chamber of Envoys.

The length of each debate and the division of time between the speakers are stated in the opening sentence of the speech given in the text. The speeches, which were all extempore, as far as the actual form is concerned, were later collected from the newspaper reports, and after some slight revision by the authors were published in 1860 in Columbus, Ohio. This volume, from which the present text is taken, contained in addition a number of speeches delivered by Lincoln and Douglas earlier in 1858 and two speeches made by Lincoln in Ohio in 1859. Lincoln's statement at the close of a letter to the publishers, accompanying the copy for the book, is characteristic and interesting: [...] "I wish the reprint to be precisely as the copies I send, without any comment whatever." [...] This Columbus issue was used as a Republican campaign document and large numbers were sold.|$|R

Professionals were divided in three groups: a first group analyzed the specific epidemiological context of stomach cancer patients attending the hospital, a second group designed on the basis of evidence and current practice the pathway flowchart in a diagram that shows on vertical axis stages of care and on orizonal axis the places of care and a third group selected quality indicators useful for future audits. After <b>joint</b> <b>debates,</b> the complete clinical pathway was reviewed by the whole group of involved professionals. Results A report including the pathway flowchart of activities articulated in clinical episodes and 28 indicators covering 5 quality dimensions was approved. Multidisciplinary team meetings as well as joint surgeon/medical oncologist examinations were introduced in hospital practice. Case management and cooperation between hospital and primary care were enhanced. The use of hospital resource and the timing between the different care stages as well as patients’ satisfaction resulted improved. Preliminary results show also improvements in clinical outcome measured. Lessons Clinical pathways are an effective instrument to decrease undesired practice variability and improve clinician performance. The early involvement of all professionals in the development of clinical pathways is critical to theirs success. The definition of quality indicators allows to evaluate and monitor implemented clinical pathways. Key messages Clinical pathways providing evidence-based practice can improve quality of care The early involvement of all professionals is a key strategy for clinical pathway development...|$|R
