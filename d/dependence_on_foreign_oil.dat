Biodiesel extracted from non edible oils like Rubber Seed Oil (RSO) is one such alternative fuel that is feasible in Sri Lanka. However RSO contains high amount of free fatty acid (FF A). This lowers the yield of methyl ester (biodiesel) formation if alkaline esterification is performed directly. Therefore a two-step trans-esterification process is used to convert high FFA non-edible oils to_biodiesel. First step is acid easterification to reduce the FFA of oil and the second step is alkaline esterification to produce bio diesel from oil with FFA reduced. ln this study two of the major factors that affect {{the efficiency of the}} acid esterification step were investigated.

40|$|This paper uses a new {{approach}} of retro-analysis. Typically policy is informed by forward-looking analysis of potential for alternative energy technologies. But historical knowledge of energy and processing requirements and greenhouse effects is more reliable for engineering evaluation of biofuel production systems. This study calculates energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions for the most ef?cient biomass feedstocks in New Zealand if the policy had been implemented to maximize liquid biofuel production in the year 2004 / 2005. The study uses existing processing technologies and agricultural statistics. Bioethanol production is calculated from putrescible wastes and starch crops, and biodiesel production from rapeseed, tallow, wood and waste paper. Each production system is further evaluated using measures of land use, energy input, crop production related to the energy product, plus relative measures of ef?ciency and renewability. The research ?ndings are that maximum biofuel production in 2004 / 2005 would have provided only a few per cent of demand, {{and would not have}} reduced <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> imported <b>oil</b> or exposure to fuel price rise.

40|$|High energy {{consumption}} in the United States has been influenced by populations, climates, income and other contextual factors. In the past decades, U. S. energy policies have pursued energy efficiency as a national strategy for reducing U. S. environmental degradation and <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>oils.</b> The quest for improved energy efficiency {{has led to the}} development of energy efficient technologies and programs. The implementation of energy programs in the complex U. S. socio-technical environment is believed to promote the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies. However, opponents doubt the fact that these programs have the capacity to significantly reduce U. S. {{energy consumption}}. In order to contribute to the ongoing discussion, this quantitative study investigated the relationships existing among electricity consumption/ intensity, energy programs and contextual factors in the U. S. buildings sector. Specifically, this study sought to identify the significant predictors of electricity consumption and intensity, as well as estimate the overall impact of selected energy programs on electricity consumption and intensity. Using state-level secondary data for 51 U. S. states from 2006 to 2009, seven random effects panel data regression models confirmed the existence of significant relationships among some energy programs, contextual factors, and electricity consumption/intensity. The most significant predictors of improved electricity efficiency included the price of electricity, public benefits funds program, building energy codes program,financial and informational incentives program and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. Consistently, the Southern region of the U. S. was associated with high electricity consumption and intensity; while the U. S. commercial sector was the greater benefactor from energy programs. On the average, energy programs were responsible for approximately 7 % of the variation observed in electricity consumption and intensity, over and above the variation associated with the contextual factors. This study also had implications in program implementation theory, and revealed that resource availability, stringency and adherence had significant impacts on program outcomes. Using seven classification tables, this study categorized and matched the predictors of electricity consumption and intensity with the specific energy sectors in which they demonstrated statistical significance. Project developers, energy advocates, policy makers, program administrators, building occupants and other stakeholders could use study findings in conjunction with other empirical findings, to make informed decisions regarding the adoption, continuation or discontinuation of energy programs, while taking contextual factors into consideration. The adoption and efficient implementation of the most significant programs could reduce U. S. electricity consumption, and in the long term, possibly reduce U. S. energy waste, environmental degradation, energy imports, energy prices, and demands for expanding energy generation and distribution infrastructure. Andrea N. Y.

40|$|CHDS State/LocalSince the 1970 s, every American {{president}} and many Congressional leaders {{have called for}} national energy independence as a top policy priority. Among many reasons the United States (U.

This study examines the unintended consequences of certain environmental policies for American homeland security. The analyses suggest that some environmental policies may have a deleterious effect on the ability of the United States to achieve a level of energy efficiency in the transportation sector that could contribute to achieving national energy security. This study suggests ways to achieve a level of sustainable energy security by reducing consumption in the most important petroleum consuming sector, that of automobile transportation. Some U.

The portion of oil used for transportation is growing and is projected to use 68 % of liquid fuel energy over the period 2004 – 2030 [1]. Moreover, transport emissions are estimated to increase by 84 % in 2030 [2]. Today, approximately 900 million vehicles worldwide are on the roads and there are estimates for the year 2020 that this number will increase to 1.1 billion [3], which will inevitably have consequences on oil demand and CO 2 emissions. Since this will {{have a negative impact}} economically, ecologically and politically, a strategy to replace fossil fuels as a source of energy for vehicles is urgently required.

30|$|The drastic {{fluctuation}} {{of international}} oil price {{will have a}} significant impact on China, the second largest oil consumer and the third oil-importing country in the world. Supported by the favorable economic situation, substantial growth in petrochemical production and strong demand for car ownership, it is expected that China’s oil demand will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2016 – 2022, with an average annual growth rate of about 2.4 %. In addition, the pattern of international crude oil trade will also change. China, India and Southeast Asia will jointly push the international crude oil flow from the west to the east. In the next 5 years, China’s net daily imports of crude oil will reach 9.5 million barrels, which is next only to the United States’ record of 10 million barrels per day in the beginning of this century. Firstly, in the process of strengthening international cooperation, China should make effective use of foreign resources to ensure energy security. Secondly, the trend of the international crude oil price is needed for our country’s refined oil price adjustment. At present, China’s <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> crude <b>oil</b> and gas is more than 65 % and 30 %. The import price of crude oil in China is greatly affected by the price of international commodity futures market. With this background, China should continue to increase investment, accelerate the national strategic crude oil reserve facilities, increase enterprise reserves infrastructure, enhance the commercial crude oil storage capacity and reduce the impact of the international energy market volatility on China’s economy. Thirdly, China will strengthen cooperation with the “One Belt and One Road” initiative along the country’s energy field, which can enrich China’s imports of energy sources to deal with future complicated geopolitical situations.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} of alternative fuels implemented in internal combustion engines are becoming {{the subjects of}} interest nowadays. This paper describes a production of biogas from cow dung, diesel engine conversion process with piston modification of ZH 1115 diesel engine. To produce biogas, the usual practice is to mix water with some organic material, such as cow dung (a free source of the appropriate micro-organisms). The slurry is placed in a leak-proof container (called a digester) and leaves it to ferment. After several days at suitable temperature, sufficient methane will have formed to make a combustible gas. Fix dome type of biogas plant is chosen in this gas production for cost saving and to produce sufficient gas at lower temperature. The biogas engine which are modified from diesel engine emphases the ignition system, gas governing and carburetion systems along with a change in compression ratio, in some cases also {{a change in the}} combustion chamber. Since diesel engine cannot be operated by biogas alone, this paper covers the conversion of diesel to spark ignition engine i. e. conversion of four stroke of ZH 1115 diesel engine to biogas engine based on 30 biogas inlet holes which was recommended by the experienced designers. This paper also describes methods of reducing compression ratio, changing ignition system with timing and fueling system, the comparisons of technical parameters and performance between ZH 1115 diesel engine and converted biogas engine. It describes the criteria of technological selections, engineering aspects and short term and long term plans for lighting.

40|$|Energy is the {{lynchpin}} {{of modern}} society. Since the early 1970 s, growing <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> energy sources, <b>oil</b> in particular, has constrained US independence in foreign policy, and at times, inhibited economic stability and growth. Addressing oil dependence is {{politically and economically}} complex. Proposed solutions are multifaceted with various objectives such as energy efficiency and resource substitution. One solution is the partial transition from an oil- to coal-based economy. A number of facts support this solution including vast coal reserves in the US and the relative price stability of coal. However, several roadblocks exist. These include uncertain recoverable reserves and the immaturity of "clean" coal technologies. This paper provides a first order analysis of the most efficient use of coal assuming the transition from oil to coal is desirable. Scenario analysis indicates two possible transition pathways: (1) bring the transportation sector onto the electric grid and (2) use coal-to-liquid fuels to directly power vehicles. The feasibility of each pathway is examined based on economic and environmental factors, among which are energy availability, affordability and efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Results indicate that partial transition of the transportation sector onto the electric grid offers the more viable solution for coal-based reduction of the US oil dependence.

DSM programs began modestly in the 1970 s in response to growing concerns about <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> sources of <b>oil</b> and environmental consequences of electricity generation, especially nuclear power. The foundation for the unique US partnership between government and utility interests can be traced first to the private-ownership structure of the vertically integrated electricity industry and second to the monopoly franchise granted by state regulators. Electricity industry restructuring calls into question both of these basic conditions, and thus the future of utility DSM programs for the public interest. Future policies guiding ratepayer-funded energy-efficiency DSM programs will need to pay close attention to the specific market objectives of the programs and to the balance between public and private interests...|$|R

Consequently have the policy outcomes of the legislative stakeholders matched the stated intentions of those involved in the deliberative debate that enacted it or, where have those objectives not been met? Research that can increase understanding of how such an important policy may have failed can inform policy deliberation in such diverse areas as agriculture, national security and energy policy while illuminating how and why such public policy was made.
