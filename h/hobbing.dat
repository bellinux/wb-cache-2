25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before <b>hobbing,</b> but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via <b>hobbing,</b> shaping, or shaving.|$|E
25|$|For {{very large}} gears the blank can be gashed to the rough shape {{first to make}} <b>hobbing</b> easier.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hobbing</b> is a {{machining}} process for gear cutting, cutting splines, and cutting sprockets on a <b>hobbing</b> machine, {{which is a}} special type of milling machine. The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by a cutting tool called a hob. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|E
25|$|A type of skiving that is {{analogous}} to the <b>hobbing</b> of external gears {{can be applied to the}} cutting of internal gears, which are skived with a rotary cutter (rather than shaped or broached).|$|E

25|$|For {{cycloidal}} gears (as used in BS978-2 Specification {{for fine}} pitch gears) and cycloidal-type gears each module, ratio {{and number of}} teeth in the pinion requires a different <b>hobbing</b> cutter, so the technique is only suitable for large volume production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hobbing</b> is used {{to produce}} most throated worm wheels, but certain tooth {{profiles}} cannot be hobbed. If any portion of the hob profile is perpendicular to the axis then it will have no cutting clearance generated by the usual backing off process, {{and it will not}} cut well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hobbing</b> uses a <b>hobbing</b> {{machine with}} two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E

Robert A. Hall, Jr., {{in his study}} of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse [...] "one of the finest and purest writers of English prose". Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character [...] "de-Beaned the cupboard". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides [...] "hobnobbing" [...] when he writes: [...] "To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not <b>hobbing.</b> Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing." ...|$|E

At p. 303, [...] "The <b>hobbing</b> process {{conceived}} in 1856 by Christian Schiele became a practical one for production work {{as soon as}} involute-shaped gear teeth superseded the cycloidal type in the 1880s, since the involute hob, like the involute rack, has straight sides (for the worm {{is a form of}} continuous rack) so that to make a hob from a worm all one has to do is to gash some teeth in the worm so that it will cut the blank as it is rotated." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{tooth profile}} {{which is a}} {{theoretical}} involute, the fundamental rack is straight-sided, with sides inclined at the pressure angle of the tooth form, with flat top and bottom. The necessary addendum correction to allow the use of small-numbered pinions can either be obtained by suitable modification of this rack to a cycloidal form at the tips, or by <b>hobbing</b> at other than the theoretical pitch circle diameter. [...] Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle, but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.|$|E
