50|$|Where a rail is laid in a Road surface (pavement) {{or within}} grassed surfaces, {{there has to}} be {{accommodation}} for the flange. This is provided by a slot called the <b>flangeway.</b> The rail is then known as grooved rail, groove rail, or girder rail. The <b>flangeway</b> has the railhead {{on one side and the}} guard on the other. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail.|$|E
50|$|The kerb-guided bus (KGB) {{guidance}} {{mechanism is}} a {{development of the}} early <b>flangeways,</b> pre-dating railways. The Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroadof 1809 therefore has a {{claim to be the}} earliest guided busway. Earlier <b>flangeways</b> existed, but were not for passenger carrying.|$|R
50|$|Whilst flextrack is {{available}} for both EM and P4 gauges (from manufacturers such as C&L Finescale, SMP and The P4 Track Company), ready-to-run (RTR) point and crossing (P&C) work is not available, so this trackwork must be constructed by the modeller. Kits for doing this are also available from the aforementioned sources amongst others. Several of these kits are also available for the OO modeller who aims for more realistic track, since most RTR track is actually scaled to HO and does not represent any British prototype and the sleeper spacing is too close together for scale. EM gauge has slightly overscale flanges and <b>flangeways</b> on point and crossing work; P4 is closer to scale but the smaller flanges and <b>flangeways</b> on P&C work expose poor track construction.|$|R
50|$|While {{the narrow}} gauge {{railroad}} {{is no longer}} used, the tunnels were once used daily to deliver food, laundry, and other items, and occasionally patients between different buildings. The rails are no longer evident in many places and the <b>flangeways</b> are filled in, leaving only {{the head of the}} rail exposed.|$|R

50|$|On 2 September 2008 vandals {{blocked the}} <b>flangeways</b> of Barnard's {{crossing}}, near Walsingham {{and used a}} level crossing gate to derail the locomotive Norfolk Hero. The passengers and train crew were not injured in this attack, and a diesel locomotive was sent from Wells to recover the stranded passenger train - although some passengers chose to ignore advice from the train crew and walked to Walsingham. Norfolk Hero was repaired and restored to service {{by the end of}} the month.|$|R
50|$|Where {{snowfall}} is an issue, {{this system}} {{may not be}} practical: since the guide rail forms the return leg of the electrical circuit, accumulation of ice and snow on the rail could cause intermittent power interruptions to the vehicle. Also, as the vehicle does not place {{a significant portion of}} its weight on the guide wheel (most of it being supported by the rubber tyres), snow packed into the <b>flangeways</b> or atop the rail by road traffic could lift the guide wheel off the rail, leading the vehicle to go off course.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of June 15, and into the next morning, violent {{thunderstorms}} hit the Hackettstown area. Around 10 p.m., lightning struck Williams and Hibler's lumber yard in Hackettstown, starting a fire that would eventually consume the yard, {{despite the efforts of}} the townspeople. Shortly after midnight, rain from another thunderstorm sent water cascading down Hazen Road and onto Rockport Crossing, where the road crossed the Lackawanna's Phillipsburg Branch. The water washed dirt and gravel down a steep hill and onto the crossing, where this debris accumulated in the <b>flangeways,</b> metal pieces installed to allow trains to pass smoothly through the crossing.|$|R
50|$|As {{the frog}} {{continues}} to be used, the <b>flangeway</b> will deepen further until new wheels will cross the frog in a fully tread-bearing mode, while worn wheels will cross the frog in a combination tread- and flange-bearing mode.|$|E
50|$|Tramway {{track is}} used on tramways or light rail operations. Grooved rails (or girder rails) are often used to provide a {{protective}} <b>flangeway</b> in the trackwork in city streets. Like standard rail tracks, tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Recreated {{track section}} for {{original}} railway in England (circa 1803) as built by Richard Trevithick. The track was originally used for horse-drawn carriages. It has the flanges {{on the track}} rather than the wheels, {{so that it is}} a <b>flangeway</b> rather than an edgeway.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{regulate}} the depth of <b>flangeways</b> in a crossing frog, the Federal Railroad Administration created rules which, by definition, prohibited the use of flange-bearing frogs on track with speed limits greater than 10 mph. Because of this, an FRA waiver is required to install full flange-bearing diamonds. Subsequent to installation, an extensive battery of inspections of both the diamond itself, and rail vehicles which cross the diamond, to ensure that safety is not compromised by the installation of such a diamond. This may change in the future, as FBF becomes a proven technology, but currently the rigorous inspections are a deterrent for widespread installation of full flange-bearing diamonds.|$|R
50|$|Several {{days after}} the accident, a jury convened in a coroner's inquest at the new opera house in Washington, New Jersey, heard {{testimony}} that pinpointed {{the cause of the}} derailment. Elmer Clayton, Mansfield Township's road supervisor, testified that the gutters on Hazen Road had been dug out recently near the area of the train accident and this material - dirt, gravel and stones - had been pushed {{to the center of the}} road to build up the crown in anticipation of laying macadam. He surmised that this loose debris had been washed down the steep slope during the rain storm and then onto the grade crossing where it clogged the <b>flangeways,</b> thus leading to the derailment.|$|R
50|$|During July and August, 2010, two {{meetings}} were convened between ECC advocates and officials from CDOT, the P&W Railroad, the New Haven Port Authority, and the Federal Railroad Administration. A number of interventions at the grade crossing were discussed. CDOT agreed to mitigate risks {{in the short}} term, during which time {{the area around the}} crossing would serve as a staging area for construction of the new I-95 Quinnipiac Bridge. CDOT agreed to repave the pitted, degraded asphalt around the tracks, a job which appeared to be complete as of Aug 20, 2010. Additionally, CDOT agreed to fill the <b>flangeways</b> with stone dust, to be removed in the event that a P&W train needed access to the New Haven Harbor. For a longer term remedy, CDOT proposed removing an eastbound vehicle lane on the bridge and replacing it with 6' bicycle lanes at {{the far edge of the}} eastbound and westbound travel lanes. Additionally, although the P&W railroad argued that flange fillers could become impregnated with ice during the winter, changing their mechanical properties and causing derailment, CDOT agreed to perform additional research into the suitability of flange fillers for the crossing. Cycling advocates noted the success of products such as the veloStrail in reducing cyclist injury elsewhere in the world, including places with cold climates.|$|R
50|$|An {{electro-mechanical}} treadle retains a small arm that lies across the <b>flangeway</b> of a rail. When it is depressed, an electrical circuit controller within the unit changes its output. It remains depressed {{for a period}} of several seconds, so that a train with many axles does not unduly damage the unit.|$|E
50|$|As {{the frog}} is used, the <b>flangeway</b> will abrade against the wheel flanges and deepen. In this case, new wheels (those with shorter flanges) will make contact between tread and frog, {{creating}} a combination tread- and flange-bearing loading on the frog. Meanwhile, worn wheels (those with taller flanges) {{will continue to}} impart a fully flange-bearing loading onto the frog.|$|E
50|$|One-way {{low-speed}} diamond frogs {{are used}} in diamond crossings, {{often referred to as}} OWLS diamonds. These types of frogs are analogous to lift frogs in turnouts: the higher-trafficked line crosses the diamond on a normal rail surface in tread-bearing mode, and the lower-trafficked line crosses over the higher-trafficked line in flange-bearing mode. Because there is no <b>flangeway</b> gap to cross on the higher-trafficked line, vehicles using this line can cross the diamonds at the maximum speed allowed by the track design. Because the lower-trafficked line is in a situation where gauge restraint is reduced and because it has to cross over the <b>flangeway</b> gap for the higher-trafficked line, vehicles using this line are limited to speeds at or below 10 mph. OWLS diamonds are commonly used where a rail line with very little traffic operating at low speed crosses a rail line with considerably more traffic operating at higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|About 2:24 a.m., {{with most}} {{passengers}} asleep, the locomotive reached Rockport Crossing. The lead pair of engine-truck wheels hit the clogged <b>flangeways</b> at the crossing and derailed the trucks to the right. With the left truck wheels running {{just inside the}} rails, and the right truck wheels just outside the rails, the engine continued down the track for another 198 feet (61 m) until the left front truck wheel hit a crossover frog from a trailing switch (part of a vestigal railroad switch track for a railroad siding at the location that in 1925 no longer existed), diverting the engine {{to the right and}} causing it to derail entirely. As the engine left the roadbed, it tilted to the left and buried itself in the railroad embankment parallel to the railroad tracks, with {{the front end of the}} engine 450 feet (138 m) from the east end of the Hazen Road crossing. The rapid deceleration of the engine caused the first passenger car, No. 23, to uncouple from the tender. The momentum of the cars behind it pushed No. 23 forward until it came to rest on the locomotive's boiler; the second passenger car, No. 33, followed, coming to rest across the rear of the boiler. The third car, the sleeper car Sirocco, came to rest next to the engine. The first two cars were carrying 90 people, the third nearly 20.|$|R
50|$|Block rail is a lower {{profile form}} of girder guard rail with the web is eliminated. In profile {{it is more}} like a solid form of bridge rail with a <b>flangeway</b> and guard added. Simply {{removing}} the web and combining the head section directly with the foot section would result in a weak rail, so additional thickness is required in the combined section.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the flange}} rides on a {{continuous}} surface in a fully flange-bearing mode, the impact loads {{generated by the}} <b>flangeway</b> gap of conventional frogs are eliminated. This reduces maintenance and extends {{the life of the}} frog, which leads to an operational cost savings that exceeds the increase in initial costs, when compared to conventional frogs. As previously mentioned, flange-bearing frogs are quieter than conventional frogs—again, because of the reduced impact loads—which provides a potential benefit when implemented near residential areas.|$|E
5000|$|In a frog gauntlet, one rail crosses over a rail on the {{adjacent}} track. A frog {{is used to}} provide the <b>flangeway</b> for the crossing tracks. The train taking the gauntlet runs over the frog onto the parallel rails, passes through the gauntlet area, and passes over another frog {{to return to the}} original line. Since there are no points or other moving parts on a frog gauntlet track, a train operating on one of the tracks cannot be routed onto the other.|$|E
5000|$|A {{guard rail}} (check rail) {{is a short}} piece of rail placed {{alongside}} the main (stock) rail opposite the frog. These exist {{to ensure that the}} wheels follow the appropriate <b>flangeway</b> through the frog and that the train does not derail. Generally, there are two of these for each frog, one by each outer rail. Guard rails are not required with a [...] "self-guarding cast manganese" [...] frog, as the raised parts of the casting serve the same purpose. These frogs are for low-speed use and are common in rail yards.|$|E
5000|$|EM was {{originally}} defined to use 18mm as the track gauge (hence the name: Eighteen Millimetres). This was revised, and today EM gauge uses an [...] track gauge, which {{is closer to}} accurate but not fully to scale. It was developed as an early improvement on the standard OO system. It is still popular with FineScale modellers today because it utilises larger than scale flanges on the wheels of rolling stock, and because point and crossing (P&C) work is a little easier due to an overscale <b>flangeway</b> clearance. These two concessions in scaling down the prototype make for reliable running. This factor explains the continued popularity of EM as a scale for finescale modellers working today.|$|E
5000|$|Flange-bearing frogs {{have been}} used by street {{railways}} for more than 100 years as a means of reducing noise pollution in populated urban settings. In 1995, Robert Willow filed a patent in the United States adapting this concept for use in mainline freight and passenger service. The patent describes the technology as, [...] "designed to support a railroad wheel to roll through the frog on its flange rather than requiring its tread to jump across a <b>flangeway</b> gap." [...] Ramps are placed {{on either side of the}} frog to gradually transition the wheel load from the tread (known as tread-bearing loading mode) to the flange (known as flange-bearing loading mode) and to lift the wheel so that the tread is completely clear of the rail.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 July 2013, {{the last}} four cars of an SNCF Paris-Limoges train left the track while {{entering}} the Brétigny-sur-Orge station, killing seven people and injuring 32. The French land transport accident investigation bureau BEA-TT concluded in an interim report published on 10 January 2014 that [...] "the derailment {{was caused by a}} fishplate obstructing the <b>flangeway</b> of an oblique crossing forming part of a double slip. Under the weight of the train travelling at 137 km/h, the fishplate had pivoted around the first of four bolts meant to hold it in place, the three others having come loose. The most likely cause of the bolts coming loose, says BEA-TT, were stresses caused by cracking in the cast steel crossing. This had caused the head of the third bolt to break off and the others to fail, one becoming unscrewed and the heads of the other two also shearing off." [...] Recommendations included improving agency expertise in bolted track joints, clarification and reinforcement of regulations for defect detection and repair, and identification of switches and crossings where higher levels of maintenance and early renewal should be implemented.|$|E
5000|$|P4, {{otherwise}} known as Protofour, or [...] "18.83", is a close to exact 4 mm:1 ft replica of real-life track and wheel dimensions. The gauge of track built to these standards is 18.83 mm. Along with EM Gauge It is also a popular choice for finescale modellers working today. The main advantage of P4 over the other 4 mm standards is that the wheel flanges are approximately to scale and the flangway gaps on P&C work are also close to scale. This is most noticeable in photographs of the model where in many cases is {{it almost impossible to}} detect that you are looking at a model, as opposed to the real thing. The disadvantages of near to scale flanges and <b>flangeway</b> crossings are that the trackwork has to be laid and built to very close tolerances and needs to be flat. If {{this is not the case}} then the reliability of rolling stock on the trackwork is compromised leading to poor running and derailments. This problem can, to an extent, be mitigated by the use of some form of suspension system in the locomotives and rolling stock used on the layout. There are different ways to do this and reference to one of the societies supporting modelling to this standard is recommended.|$|E
40|$|The worn wheel {{profiles}} {{generated by}} uni-directional wagon travel produce different profile shapes {{on the leading}} and trailing wheelsets of each bogie. In the case examined both leading and trailing wheels wear to profiles having greater effective wheel conicity. The leading worn wheels exhibit flange and tread wear and the worn profile has highly non-linear conicity having little vertical displacement over the middle range of lateral displacement. A large vertical displacement is still achieved by the worn leading wheel profile in the last section of the <b>flangeway</b> clearance. The worn trailing wheels have only tread wear with near linear effective conicity across the <b>flangeway.</b> The hunting instability performances of the vehicle with the uni-directional wheel wear profiles is shown {{to have a higher}} critical speed than new wheel profiles due to the mismatch of the leading and trailing wheel profiles. The leading wheels of the bogie hunt with a wavelength of 26 - 30 m whilst the trailing wheels hunt at a wavelength of 12 - 16 m. Because of the differing frequency responses in the front and rear wheelsets of each bogie, lateral instability is damped for the worn wheel profiles. The worn profiles’ curving performance is also improved due to increases in the total profile conicity. Individually the leading wheel worn profile with its non-linear conicity across the <b>flangeway</b> has lower critical speed than a new wheel profile, the non-linear shape leading to chaotic lateral instability. The trailing wheel profile with its highly linear conicity across the middle of the <b>flangeway</b> has classic sinusoidal hunting at a much reduced critical speed and much reduced wavelength. The worn wheel profiles by themselves for both leading wheel and trailing wheel are found to have critical speeds 80 % of the new wheel profile critical speed. In combination as found in a wagon operating in one direction, the leading and trailing wheel profiles produce a critical hunting speed 125 % of the new wheel profiles’ critical hunting speed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Streetcar or {{train tracks}} {{in urban areas}} are {{difficult}} for bicyclists to negotiate and are a cause of crashes and injuries. This study used mixed methods to identify measures to prevent such crashes, by examining track-related crashes that resulted in injuries to cyclists, and obtaining information from the local transit agency and bike shops. Methods We compared personal, trip, and route infrastructure characteristics of 87 crashes directly involving streetcar or train tracks to 189 crashes in other circumstances in Toronto, Canada. We complemented this with engineering information about the rail systems, interviews of personnel at seven bike shops about advice they provide to customers, and width measurements of tires on commonly sold bikes. Results In our study, 32  % of injured cyclists had crashes that directly involved tracks. The vast majority resulted from the bike tire being caught in the rail <b>flangeway</b> (gap in the road surface alongside rails), often when cyclists made unplanned maneuvers to avoid a collision. Track crashes were more common on major city streets with parked cars and no bike infrastructure, with left turns at intersections, with hybrid, racing and city bikes, among less experienced and less frequent bicyclists, and among women. Commonly sold bikes typically had tire widths narrower than the smallest track flangeways. There were no track crashes in route sections where streetcars and trains had dedicated rights of way. Conclusions Given our results, prevention efforts might be directed at individual knowledge, bicycle tires, or route design, but their potential for success is likely to differ. Although {{it may be possible}} to reach a broader audience with continued advice about how to avoid track crashes, the persistence and frequency of these crashes and their unpredictable circumstances indicates that other solutions are needed. Using tires wider than streetcar or train flangeways could prevent some crashes, though there are other considerations that lead many cyclists to have narrower tires. To prevent the majority of track-involved injuries, route design measures including dedicated rail rights of way, cycle tracks (physically separated bike lanes), and protected intersections would be the best strategy...|$|E
