40|$|This paper {{analyses}} selected public addresses by two {{key figures}} behind the indigenization drive in Zimbabwe, Honourable Minister Saviour <b>Kasukuwere</b> and His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Robert Gabriel Mugabe. Minister <b>Kasukuwere,</b> {{head of the}} Ministry of Youth Development, Indigenization and Empowerment, has lectured extensively on the ethos of the indigenization process, in like terms, President Robert Mugabe, as First Secretary of the revolutionary Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF), has addressed both the Zimbabwean populate {{and the international community}} on the justification of the indigenization process at various fora. The research used content analysis of the selected speeches by Minister <b>Kasukuwere</b> and President Mugabe, respectively, alongside interview of attendees to the public addresses in question.
