2500|$|The ever-modest Altham, however, {{provided}} his own verdict (in the book's fourth edition in 1948): [...] "This not-inconsiderable labour I {{could not}} have undertaken by myself, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> enough to secure the collaboration of Mr. E.

[...] "If I cut it {{now for the first}} time I think it would be a hit. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have latched onto that one, and that was all Sherrill's doing.

2500|$|Peniston later {{commented on}} her {{recording}} with Saison, [...] "I {{had the pleasure}} of working with a very talented and inspiring artist by the name of Saison.

She explained [...] " [...] {{starting to get}} my head around computer home recording ... I decided to put out my own EP independently.

We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> to really get to know him when my career stopped. I believe he was also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|While still {{attending}} Franklin in 1943, Capote {{began working}} as a copyboy in the art department at The New Yorker, a job he held {{for two years before}} being fired for angering poet Robert Frost. Years later, he reminisced, [...] "Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn't a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, at least in my own case." [...] He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and began writing his first novel, Summer Crossing.|$|E
2500|$|Julie Andrews gained her {{big break}} when her {{stepfather}} {{introduced her to}} Val Parnell, whose Moss Empires controlled prominent venues in London. Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome singing the difficult aria [...] "Je suis Titania" [...] from Mignon {{as part of a}} musical revue called [...] "Starlight Roof" [...] on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year. Andrews recalled: [...] "Starlight Roof" [...] saying, [...] "There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy." ...|$|E

Khorkina said, [...] "I thought she could win the gold. I'm glad I could give her that opportunity." [...] She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide {{the future of a}} sports person. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> to have many people to help me get through it. Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia. I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole." [...] She then won the silver medal in the floor final with a score of 9.812.|$|E
2500|$|Colvin's first {{involvement}} with international cricket came in August 2005, when the England team {{was preparing to}} face the Australian women's international team at the Hove County Cricket Ground. She was invited to bowl against the English team in the nets to give them practice against a left-arm spinner, who the Australian team was fielding {{in the form of}} Shelley Nitschke. After the practice session, Colvin was asked to be available for the four-day [...] by team coach Richard Bates. Team captain Clare Connor admitted that her inclusion was [...] "pure hunch", believing that the dry, dusty wicket would be favourable to spin bowling. Bates explained to The Times that [...] "the pitch [...] a little worn, and we felt that Holly could help us exploit it". Colvin made her England debut on 9 August 2005, becoming at 15 years and 336 days the youngest cricketer (of either sex) to play Test cricket for England. She took three wickets in her inaugural game, dismissing Kate Blackwell and Julia Price in two consecutive balls and nearly taking Julie Hayes for a hat-trick. Reminiscing over the experience in February 2008, Colvin remarked that [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate...</b> I had no idea who I was playing against – all these big names that were coming up against me and I had pretty much no idea". She described her near-hat-trick as a [...] "pretty special [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – and then look at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E
