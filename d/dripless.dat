50|$|Commercially, {{behenic acid}} {{is often used}} to give hair conditioners and moisturizers their {{smoothing}} properties. It is also used in lubricating oils, and as a solvent evaporation retarder in paint removers. Its amide is used as an anti-foaming agent in detergents, floor polishes and <b>dripless</b> candles. Reduction of behenic acid yields behenyl alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Ralph was a salesman, an innovator, and an entrepreneur. He {{patented}} a <b>dripless</b> aluminum teabag {{called the}} teastir, {{and made an}} instant silver polish. When his children chewed the paper straws in their milkshakes, he developed the first plastic straw for McDonald’s by using the outer part of a plastic clothes line. He was a dedicated volunteer, working as a group leader and board member at a settlement house, a volunteer for public television, and a committee member for the Cleveland United Appeal. He even helped plan and cook fundraising spaghetti dinners.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, the Williamsburg Candle Soap and Candle Co. {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of candles around the world both under their label as well as private label candles for companies such as Estee Lauder, Pottery Barn and others. They were known for their fine quality candles that were <b>dripless</b> and clean burning. All of its candles were made at the on-site manufacturing plant, {{and all of the}} candle-making equipment were designed and built by its owners and employees. [...] Customers could view the products being made through a glass window in the store; and were allowed to dip their own candles.|$|E
40|$|During {{the months}} of March and April of 1994, a {{motorized}} (hands-off) version of the <b>Dripless</b> Bubbler ultrasonic scanner was field tested at the FAA-Aging Aircraft Nondestructive Inspection Validation Center (AANC) in Albuquerque, NM and at Northwest Airlines (NWA) in Minneapolis, MN. The purpose of the field demonstrations was to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>Dripless</b> Bubbler for ultrasonic nondestructive inspection (NDI) of fuselage lap splices, tear straps, and composite repair patches for the presence of disbond and corrosion...|$|E

40|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{requirements}} of the air carrier maintenance community, we have developed a closed-cycle, water-coupled, ultrasonic method using a focused-beam broadband pulse for the nondestructive inspection (NDI) of adhesively bonded aluminum and composite aircraft fuselage structures. This approach, known as the “Dripless Bubbler” technique, is a combination of focused-beam immersion ultrasonics with portable ultrasonic scanners[1 – 4]. The <b>Dripless</b> Bubbler retains the high quality associated with focused-beam immersion ultrasonics, eliminates uncontained couplant water; and more importantly, it provides the capability to ultrasonically scan the exterior of an aircraft over surface protrusions such as button-head rivets and lap splice edges...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} FAA`s National Aging Aircraft Research Program {{to foster}} new {{technologies}} for civil aircraft maintenance and repair, use of bonded composite doublers on metal aircraft structures has been advanced. Research and validation of such doubler applications on US certified commercial aircraft has begun. A specific composite application to assess the capabilities of composite doublers was chosen on a L- 1011 aircraft for reinforcement of the comer of a cargo door frame where a boron-epoxy repair patch of up to 72 plies was installed. A primary inspection requirement for these doublers is the identification of disbonds between the composite laminate and the aluminum parent material. This paper describes {{the development of an}} ultrasonic pulse echo technique using a modified immersion focus transducer where a robust signal amplitude signature of the composite aluminum interface is obtained to characterize the condition of the bond. Example waveforms and C-scan images are shown to illustrate the ultrasonic response for various transducer configurations using a boron-epoxy aluminum skin calibration test sample where disbonds and delaminations were built-in. The modified focus transducer is compatible with portable ultrasonic scanning systems that utilize the weeper or <b>dripless</b> bubbler technologies when an ultrasonic inspection of the boron-epoxy composite doublers installed on aircraft is implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} and characterization of corrosion {{is one of}} the many challenges in the nondestructive inspection (NDI) of aging aircraft. A number of groups are pursuing ultrasonic techniques for the {{detection and}} evaluation of corrosion in such aluminum fuselage structures such as lap splices and tear straps [1]. Under the FAA-Aging Aircraft Research Program, Patton and Hsu [2 – 4] at Iowa State University have developed the capability to apply high resolution, water-coupled, focused-beam ultrasonic NDI to aircraft fuselage structures in a maintenance hangar environment. The method, known as the “Dripless Bubbler” technique, is a combination of focused-beam immersion ultrasonics with a portable ultrasonic scanner. With the <b>Dripless</b> Bubbler, B- and C-scan images of the aircraft fuselage may be acquired using both high frequency and low frequency immersion ultrasonics typically only reserved for the laboratory. In this paper, we present results on corrosion detection in the outer aluminum skin of a fuselage lap splice section using high frequency (15 MHz nominal center frequency) immersion ultrasonics, and compare these results against those obtained from collimated-beam X-ray attenuation measurements. This comparison has been quite instructive and revealed several important considerations in the interpretation of both ultrasonic and X-ray data when applied to the quantitative measurement of metal skin thickness...|$|E
