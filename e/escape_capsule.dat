5|$|On 29 August 1984, B-1A (AF Ser. No. 74-0159) stalled {{and crashed}} while {{performing}} minimum control speed tests at low altitude. The crew used the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> {{to leave the}} bomber, but the parachutes deployed improperly, causing the capsule to hit nose down. The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, and seriously injured two other crew members.|$|E
5|$|The USAF F-111A and Navy F-111B {{variants}} {{used the}} same airframe structural components and TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured side-by-side crew seating in an <b>escape</b> <b>capsule,</b> {{as required by the}} Navy. Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, declaring that the Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy. The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
50|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>capsules</b> {{and shelter}} {{facilities}} were discussed in China {{after the news}} was released of the 33 Chilean miners being pulled to safety. An underground mine rescue chamber {{is believed to have}} played a key role. Luo Lin, head of the State Administration of Work Safety, made the remark at a meeting in Henan province after a gas leak killed 37 miners there. Mines in China were to have underground <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> and other emergency facilities by 2015, according to a previous administration work schedule.|$|R

25|$|An escape {{crew capsule}} is an <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> which allows {{one or more}} {{occupants}} of an aircraft or spacecraft {{to escape from the}} craft while it is subjected to extreme conditions, such as high speed or altitude. The occupant remains encapsulated and protected until such time as the external environment is suitable for direct exposure or the capsule reaches the ground.|$|E
25|$|The F-111A mockup was {{inspected}} in September 1963. The {{first test}} F-111A was {{rolled out of}} Plant 4 of General Dynamics' Fort Worth, Texas facility on 15 October 1964. It was powered by YTF30-P-1 turbofans and used a set of ejector seats as the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> was not yet available. The F-111A first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, U.S. The first F-111B was also equipped with ejector seats and first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E
25|$|The F-111 used {{a three-point}} landing gear arrangement, with a two-wheel nose gear and two single-wheel {{main landing gear}} units. The landing gear door for the main gear, which was {{positioned}} {{in the center of}} the fuselage, also served as a speed brake in flight. Most F-111 variants included a terrain-following radar system connected to the autopilot. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines. The F-111's variable-geometry wings, <b>escape</b> <b>capsule,</b> terrain following radar, and afterburning turbofans were new technologies for production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Drogue parachutes {{may also}} be used to help {{stabilise}} direction of something in flight, such as a thrown RKG-3 anti-tank grenade.It is often used to gain control of very fast descents, including those of spacecraft during atmospheric reentry or nuclear bombs such as the B61 and B83. Some <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> used by supersonic aircraft deploy drogue parachutes to stabilise and slow down, allowing either a main chute to be deployed or the pilot to exit the capsule and use a personal chute.|$|R
50|$|The Changcun coal mine, which {{belongs to}} Shanxi's Lu'an Group, has been {{equipped}} with 16 underground <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> and seven shelter rooms. It was China's first mine with such safety facilities, China Youth Daily reported over the weekend. The capsule is a steel structure measuring 6.3 meters by 1.4 meters by 1.8 meters and can withstand {{the impact of}} a gas explosion. It has its own oxygen supply, air purifier and air conditioner and can keep 12 miners alive for 96 hours, according to the report.|$|R
50|$|The boat's {{emergency}} buoys and <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> {{had been}} welded to the hull to prevent losing them at sea, so escape {{would require the}} crew to make a free ascent in Arctic waters. Suvorov assumed that his report {{that he would make}} a test dive had been received, and that the duty officer would give the alarm in about an hour when he failed to report re-surfacing. He ordered his crew to remain at their stations and await rescue, even though the boat's battery had begun releasing hydrogen.|$|R
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule.</b> Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E
25|$|The Mach 3 XB-70's two crew escape {{capsules}} did {{not work}} well the only time they were needed. On June 8, 1966, XB-70 airframe AV/2 {{was involved in a}} mid-air crash with an F-104 Starfighter. Maj. Carl Cross's seat was unable to retract backwards into the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> due to high-g-forces as the plane spiraled downwards. He died in the crash. Maj. Al White's seat did retract but his elbow protruded from the capsule and blocked the closing clamshell doors. He struggled to free his trapped elbow. As soon as he freed the doors, he was ejected from the plane and descended by parachute as planned. Due to pain and confusion, White failed to trigger the manually activated airbag which would normally cushion the capsule upon landing. When the capsule hit the ground, White was subjected to an estimated 33 to 44 g (320 to 430m/s²). He received serious injuries, but nevertheless survived.|$|E
25|$|McNamara {{developed}} a basic set of requirements for TFX {{based largely on}} the Air Force's requirements and, on 1 September 1961, ordered the Air Force to develop it. A request for proposals (RFP) for the TFX was provided to industry in October 1961. In December, proposals were received from Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic. The evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to submit enhanced designs. Boeing's proposal was recommended by the selection board in January 1962, {{with the exception of}} the engine, which was not considered acceptable. Switching to a crew <b>escape</b> <b>capsule,</b> instead of ejection seats and alterations to radar and missile storage were also needed. Both companies provided updated proposals in April 1962. Air Force reviewers favored Boeing's offering, while the Navy found both submissions unacceptable for its operations. Two more rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted, with Boeing being picked by the selection board.|$|E

2500|$|Fuel can be {{replenished}} after docking with a space station, {{which requires}} matching the ship's rotation {{to that of}} the station before entering the docking bay - a task that can be avoided by purchasing a docking computer. Equipment upgrades include a fuel scoop, which allows raw fuel to be skimmed from the surface of stars, described by the manual as [...] "a dangerous and difficult activity", but in practice a fairly simple process far easier than manually docking at a space station—and collecting free-floating cargo canisters and <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> liberated after the destruction of other ships.|$|R
2500|$|Kelly Johnson, {{founder of}} Lockheed Skunk Works, and {{developer}} of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird family of spy planes, commented on <b>escape</b> crew <b>capsules</b> when discussing {{development of the}} YF-12A (Blackbird) ejection seat: [...] "We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity {{on the ground and}} through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did achieve our design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high velocity re-entry from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the pressure suit, which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft." [...] Rather than using <b>escape</b> <b>capsules,</b> SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore full pressure suits for high-altitude ejections. The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.|$|R
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> {{was designed}} for the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} design {{went through}} considerable evolution, owing to both its cutting-edge technology and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with {{a span of}} 19ft 10in (6.04 m), and a wing of 53.5° sweep. The aircraft in this configuration {{would have had a}} maximum takeoff weight of 99,400lb (45,088kg) with a 72,550 feet (22,113 m) operational ceiling. In addition to the F-108's interceptor role, North American proposed it as an escort fighter for its own B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber prototype. Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> and General Electric YJ93 engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be [...] "gap-fillers" [...] for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to [...] per hour.|$|E
500|$|In February1958, the {{proposed}} bomber was designated B-70, with the prototypes receiving the [...] "X" [...] experimental prototype designation. The name [...] "Valkyrie" [...] was the winning submission in early 1958, selected from 20,000 entries in a USAF [...] "Name the B-70" [...] contest. The Air Force approved an 18-month program acceleration in March1958 that rescheduled {{the first flight}} to December 1961. But in late 1958 the service announced that this acceleration {{would not be possible}} due to lack of funding. In December 1958, a Phase II contract was issued. The mockup of the B-70 was reviewed by the Air Force in March1959. Provisions for air-to-surface missiles and external fuel tanks were requested afterward. At the same time, North American was developing the F-108 supersonic interceptor. To reduce program costs, the F-108 would share two of the engines, the <b>escape</b> <b>capsule,</b> and some smaller systems with the B-70. In early 1960, North American and the USAF released the first drawing of the XB-70 to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they were}} {{intended}} to fly too high and fast for safe use of conventional ejection seats, the Bell X-2, B-58 Hustler, XB-70 Valkyrie, and B‑1A Lancer all used enclosed <b>escape</b> crew <b>capsules</b> of some kind.|$|R

500|$|Rockwell's design {{featured}} {{a number of}} features common to 1960s U.S. designs. Among these {{was the use of}} a crew <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> that ejected as a unit during emergencies, which was introduced to improve survivability {{in the case of an}} ejection at high speed. Additionally, the design featured large variable-sweep wings in order to provide both high lift during takeoff and landing, and low drag during a high-speed dash phase. [...] With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases. Penetration of the Soviet Union's defenses would take place at supersonic speed, crossing them as quickly as possible before entering into the less defended [...] "heartland" [...] where speeds could be reduced again. The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow the [...] "dash" [...] portion of the flight to be relatively long.|$|E
2500|$|Pioneering {{developments}} in jettisonable-cockpit style <b>escape</b> <b>capsule</b> systems occurred in Nazi Germany, by both Heinkel Flugzeugwerke {{and by the}} Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (German Institute for Glider Research). [...] Heinkel Flugzeugwerke built the first ejection-seat-equipped combat aircraft, the Heinkel He 219. [...] Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug flew the Heinkel He 176 rocket plane (in 1939), and the DFS 228 research aircraft, both of which had a jettisonable nose.|$|E

25|$|The loss of Tower 4, {{together}} with the increasing emphasis on ICBMs as the predominant threat, led a reassessment of the remaining towers. <b>Escape</b> <b>capsules</b> {{were added to the}} two remaining towers, allowing rapid evacuation. Shortly thereafter it was decided to close the remaining towers, and the electronic equipment was removed. Both platforms were expected to be returned to shore for scrap, but Tower 2 sank and could not be recovered. Tower 3 was then filled with foam before being knocked off its support, and it was successfully returned to shore and dismantled. The wreckage of Towers 2 and 4 remains in place on the ocean floor. Radar coverage was taken over by alterations to EC-121 airborne early warning flights based out of Otis Air Force Base.|$|R
50|$|Another {{operational}} area is fire protection, {{for instance in}} chemical industry or rescue in the mining industry, where need for a long use duration forbids use of compressed air sets. Advancements in rebreather design include special more-or-less complex gas proportioning and control devices, allowing use even deeper and even longer, for work divers, than emergency breathing sets {{and the type of}} sport diving called technical diving. Today's escape sets are combined with lifejackets and protection hoods to protect the head and breathing organs from being overpowered by water. They are used with thermal protection suits similar to the well-known scuba diving drysuits. Use is nevertheless limited to comparatively small depths; <b>escape</b> <b>capsules</b> and rescue submarines and emergency lift devices and droppable ballast provide safety in deeper water.|$|R

50|$|The real-life {{feasibility}} of any DSRV-based rescue attempt is hotly debated, because the few available docking chambers of a stricken submarine may be flooded, trapping the sailors still alive in other dry compartments. The only attempt {{to rescue a}} stricken submarine with these so far (the Kursk submarine) ended in failure as the entire crew who survived the explosion had either suffocated or burned to death before the rescuers could get there. Because of these difficulties, the use of integrated crew <b>escape</b> <b>capsules,</b> detachable conning towers, or both have gained favour in military submarine design {{during the last two}} decades. DSRVs that remain in use are primarily relegated to clandestine missions and undersea military equipment maintenance. The rapid development of safe, cost-saving ROV technology has also rendered some DSVs obsolete.|$|R
