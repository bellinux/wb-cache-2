50|$|Magnetic <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors {{involve the}} use of a {{permanent}} magnet sealed inside a float whose rise and fall causes the opening or closing of a mechanical switch, either through direct contact or in proximity of a reed switch. With mechanically actuated floats, the float is directly connected to a micro switch. For both magnetic and mechanical <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the lake}} to exist {{there must be a}} {{hydrostatic}} seal along the entire perimeter, if the <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> is higher than the threshold. A hydrostatic seal is created when the ice is so much higher around the lake that the equipotential surface dips down into impermeable ground. Water from underneath this ice rim is then pressed back into the lake by the hydrostatic seal. [...] In Lake Vostok the ice rim has been estimated to a mere 7 m, while the <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> is about 3 km above the lake ceiling.|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} behind magnetic, mechanical, cable, {{and other}} <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors often involves the opening or closing of a mechanical switch, either through {{direct contact with}} the switch, or magnetic operation of a reed. In other instances, such as magnetostrictive sensors, continuous monitoring is possible using a float principle.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetoresistance <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors {{are similar}} to <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors however a {{permanent}} magnet pair is sealed inside the float arm pivot. As the float moves up the motion and location are transmitted as the angular position of the magnetic field. This detection system is highly accurate down to 0.02° of motion. The field compass location provides a physical location of the float position. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy of the float. The electronic monitoring system does not {{come in contact with}} the fluid and is considered Intrinsic safety: or explosion proof. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, vehicle, aviation, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. [...] Due to the presence of a microprocessor and low power consumption, there is also capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{vacuum breaker}} in the milkhouse cyclically pulled milk from the cart {{into a glass}} jar using system vacuum, followed by a release of vacuum to atmospheric pressure, allowing the milk to flow into the bulk tank by gravity flow. When the <b>float</b> <b>level</b> in the jar dropped to setpoint, system vacuum was reapplied to restart the process. Check valves on the vacuum breaker milk hose prevented milk from flowing backwards to the cart when the jar vacuum was released.|$|E
50|$|The {{water in}} the lake can have a <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> much above {{the level of the}} ground threshold.

50|$|If the {{hydrostatic}} seal is penetrated {{when the}} <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> is high, {{the water will}} start flowing out in a jökulhlaup. Due to melting of the channel the discharge increases exponentially, unless other processes allow the discharge to increase even faster. Due to the high head {{that can be achieved}} in subglacial lakes, jökulhlaups may reach very high rates of discharge.|$|R

The graph depicting the pressure data after deconvolution between the raw pressure data and the normalized balloon wavelet shows clearly the strong filtering-out of the neutral buoyancy oscillations...|$|R
50|$|Magnetostrictive level sensors {{are similar}} to float type sensors in that a {{permanent}} magnet sealed inside a float travels {{up and down a}} stem in which a magnetostrictive wire is sealed. Ideal for high-accuracy, continuous level measurement {{of a wide variety of}} liquids in storage and shipping containers, these sensors require the proper choice of float based on the specific gravity of the liquid. When choosing float and stem materials for magnetostrictive level sensors, the same guidelines described for magnetic and mechanical <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors apply.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel level}} {{indication}} {{system in the}} simplest form is a transparent window on the tank side and in its usual application a float-driven potentiometer installed in the tank. After the TWA Flight 800 disaster, a revision was made to aircraft fuel systems to address the potential explosion hazard of electrical components located in the fuel tank. Single-engine piston aircraft fuel level systems moved to utilize <b>float</b> <b>level</b> gauges from the CNG and LPG industries which had the float drive a magnetic coupling and relocated the potentiometer outside the fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|With magnetically {{actuated}} float sensors, switching {{occurs when}} a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching {{occurs as a result}} of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} {{eighteen}} Malays {{were brought to the}} side, and the two canoes, which were <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> with the water, were towed up and fastened by a rope to the stern of the gunboat. Even when safely on deck, the two parties were still so infuriated that they had to be separated and placed under guards apart from each other. Three or four had been killed by the stabs of the deadly krises, and their bodies could be seen floating astern. Several of those rescued had wounds more or less severe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> can {{be thought}} of as the water level in a hole drilled through the ice into the lake. It is {{equivalent}} to the level at which a piece of the ice over it would float if it were a normal ice shelf. The ceiling can therefore be conceived as an ice shelf that is grounded along its entire perimeter, which explains why it has been called a captured ice shelf. As it moves over the lake, it enters the lake at the floating line, and it leaves the lake at the grounding line.|$|R
50|$|Since jökulhlaups {{emerge from}} hydrostatically-sealed lakes with <b>floating</b> <b>levels</b> {{far above the}} threshold, their peak {{discharge}} can be much larger {{than that of a}} marginal or extra-marginal lake burst. The hydrograph of a jökulhlaup from Vatnajökull typically either climbs over a period of weeks with the largest flow near the end, or it climbs much faster during the course of some hours. These patterns are suggested to reflect channel melting, and sheet flow under the front, respectively. Similar processes on a very large scale occurred during the deglaciation of North America and Europe after the last ice age (e.g., Lake Agassiz and the English Channel), and presumably at earlier times, although the geological record is not well preserved.|$|R
50|$|Resistive chain level sensors {{are similar}} to {{magnetic}} <b>float</b> <b>level</b> sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float moves {{up and down a}} stem in which closely spaced switches and resistors are sealed. When the switches are closed, the resistance is summed and converted to current or voltage signals that are proportional {{to the level of the}} liquid. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. With the proper choice of two floats, resistive chain level sensors can also be used to monitor for the presence of an interface between two immiscible liquids whose specific gravities are more than 0.6, but differ by as little as 0.1 unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} float chamber, and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the <b>float</b> <b>level.</b> Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The float chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|E

40|$|The Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme (SWTS, UAE) {{consists}} of a twin DN 1600 DI PN 25 pipeline transmitting 150 MIGD over 250 km from Shuweihat Desalination plant to Mussafah (Abu Dhabi city). The Scheme is divided in two subsequent systems, each with a tank farm and a pump station delivering water to downstream terminal reservoirs and direct consumers. The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The pipeline follows roughly the UAE coastline and the profile is generally flat with a few local high points. The surge study of the Lot C system investigated {{a large number of}} scenarios and resulted in the design of surge protection equipments and control systems. The surge protection equipment {{consists of}} 16 x 121 m 3 (1936 m 3) innovative vertical non-vented air vessels, invented by Deltares. The innovation includes a passive air release valve at a strategic elevation on the air vessel. This air release valve opens if the water level drops below the <b>float</b> <b>level.</b> At this water level the air pressure is super-atmospheric so that air is released from the air vessel to prevent draining. This innovation was driven by the initial findings of the surge analysis where it became apparent that 22 x 220 m 3 (4840 m 3) air vessels would have been required. These large vessels were the result of a double constraint. On the one hand, the initial air mass had to be sufficient to allow a proper expansion of the vessels and thus the protection of the pipeline against excessive negative pressures. On the other hand, a very small initial air mass was required {{due to the lack of}} backpressure. This meant that the air pocket was expanding by a factor exceeding 20, resulting in the emptying of the vessels. In this paper, we will describe the hydraulic model of the hybrid air vessel, detail the benefits of the new design and discuss the cost savings compared to conventional air vessels. It is concluded that the hybrid air vessel has saved over 50 % of the required air vessels total volume. Considering the size of air vessels initially required, the costs savings in terms of surge protection of the SWTS Lot C system were cut in excess of 60 %.

40|$|AbstractGiven recent {{developments}} {{in terms of economic}} and financial evolution during recent years, the question concerning the architecture and the central pillars of a new financial regulatory system, is frequently raised inside the EU, by both academic, political and business environment.

Now and then the crabs slipped, or tore through the oil-soaked wood when the great barrel swung up into the sunlight, and it came crashing down; while each time they made an opening, the rest slipped down, grinding upon each other, and squeezed it up again.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study identifying the response of a 1. 5 MW Wave Dragon to extreme conditions typical of the DanWEC test center. The best strategies allowing for a reduction in the extreme mooring tension have also been investigated, showing that this is possible by increasing the surge natural period of the system. The most efficient strategy in doing this is to provide the mooring system with a large horizontal compliance (typically in the order of 100 s), which shall be therefore assumed as design configuration. If this is not possible, it can also be partly achieved by lowering the <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> to a minimum (survivability mode) and by adopting a negative trim position. The adoption of the design configuration would determine in a 100 -year storm extreme mooring tensions in the order of 0. 9 MN, 65 % lower than the worst case experienced in the worst case configuration. At the same time it would lead to a reduction in the extreme motion response, resulting in heave and pitch oscillation heights of 7 m and 19 ° and surge excursion of 12 m. Future work will numerically identify mooring configurations that could provide the desired compliance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUniverses {{are used}} in Type Theory to ensure {{consistency}} by checking that definitions are well-stratified according to a certain hierarchy. In {{the case of the}} Coq proof assistant, based on the predicative Calculus of Inductive Constructions (pCIC), this hierachy is built from an impredicative sort Prop and an infinite number of predicative Type_i universes. A cumulativity relation represents the inclusion order of uni- verses in the core theory. Originally, universes were thought to be <b>floating</b> <b>levels,</b> and definitions to implicitly constrain these levels in a consistent manner. This works well for most theories, however the globality of levels and constraints precludes generic constructions on universes that could work at different levels. Universe polymorphism extends this setup by adding local bindings of universes and constraints, supporting generic definitions over universes, reusable at different levels. This provides the same kind of code reuse facilities as ML-style parametric polymorphism. However, the structure and hierarchy of universes is more complex than bare polymorphic type variables. In this paper, we introduce a conservative extension of pCIC supporting universe polymorphism and treating its whole hierarchy. This new design supports typical ambiguity and implicit polymorphic generalization at the same time, keeping it mostly transparent to the user. Benchmarking the implementation {{as an extension of the}} Coq proof assistant on real-world examples gives encouraging results...|$|R

40|$|We {{revised the}} OTFTOOL which was {{developed}} in Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) for the On-The-Fly (OTF) observation. Besides the improvement of data resampling function of conventional OTFTOOL, we added a new SELF referencing mode and data pre-reduction function. Since OTF observation data have a large redundancy, we can choose and use only good quality samples excluding bad samples. Sorting out the bad samples {{is based on the}} <b>floating</b> <b>level,</b> rms level, antenna trajectory, elevation, T_{sys} and number of samples. And, spikes are also removed. Referencing method can be chosen between CLASSICAL mode in which the references are taken from the OFFs observation and ELLIPSOIDAL mode in which the references are taken from the inner source free region (this is named as SELF reference). Baseline is subtracted with the source free channel windows and the baseline order chosen by the user. Passing through these procedures, the raw OTF data will be an FITS datacube. The revised-OTFTOOL maximizes the advantages of OTF observation by sorting out the bad samples in the earliest stage. And the new self-referencing method, the ELLIPSOIDAL mode, is very powerful to reduce the data. Moreover since it is possible to see the datacube at once without moving them into other data reduction programs, it is very useful and convenient to check whether the data resampling works well or not. We expect that the revised-OTFTOOL {{can be applied to the}} facilities of the OTF observation like SRAO, NRAO, and FCRAO...|$|R
