5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
30|$|Magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction, equatorward of the auroral {{emission}} region (subauroral latitudes), often generates subauroral polarization streams (SAPS). Nagano et al.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new diagnostic tool {{for the study of}} Zeeman-compensated slowing of an alkali atomic beam. Our time-of-flight technique measures the longitudinal veloc- ity distribution of <b>the</b> <b>slowed</b> atoms with a resolution below the Doppler limit of 30 cm/s. Furthermore, it can map the position and velocity distribution of atoms in either ground hyperfine level inside the solenoid without any devices inside the solenoid. The technique reveals the optical pumping ef- fects, and shows <b>in</b> detail how <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> within <b>the</b> solenoid proceeds. We find that most atoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chosen hyperfine state are decelerated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> process. <b>The</b> width of the velocity distribution is mainly determined by inhomogeneities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> laser beam, and after expanding the laser beam, the width is reduced to 2. 5 m/s, corresponding to 3. 2 mK. Fi- nally, we discuss and show a method to produce a beam with two-velocity components for the study of head-tail low energy collisions...|$|R

5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard {{has been a}} significant factor in its survival. In the past, largely due its lack of color variations, the Buckeye has not been an especially popular exhibition breed, but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slow</b> Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The two cruisers {{ordered in}} the 1905–1906 program {{represented}} a continuation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow,</b> upward trend in displacement, {{though the two}} ships had the same top speed as the earlier Königsberg-class ships. Like the preceding classes, one ship was equipped with turbine engines, and one with reciprocating machinery; {{this was to be}} the last time a German cruiser utilized the older triple-expansion engines. All subsequent designs adopted steam turbines universally. Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers. Both vessels served on foreign stations for the majority of their careers; Emden was assigned to the East Asia Squadron after she entered service, and Dresden spent much time off the North American Atlantic coast.|$|E

5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a {{concrete}} barrier leaving the turn. Goethe was conscious but needed aid in {{getting out of the}} Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, but was unable to get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The qualifying session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:15.632. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard with his fastest time was 0.102 seconds slower and used his team's spare monocoque while the McLaren mechanics fitted his race car with a new fuel pump. Barrichello secured third having changed his car's set-up during the session which garnered confusion over changes in the ride height. Häkkinen took fourth and was pushed down to his position by Barrichello with the Finn struggling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> speed corners. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and was happy with his starting position. Irvine was pushed down by Ralf Schumacher to sixth in the closing stages of qualifying. BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve managed seventh. The Jordan drivers of Trulli and Frentzen took seventh and eighth positions respectively although both drivers were disappointed with their performance. Button rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert, who took eleventh, missed out in qualifying in the top ten by nearly three-tenths of a second. Salo captured twelfth on the grid with his fastest time set when air and track temperatures were lowered by cloud cover. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Arrows. Fisichella started from 14th position, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Benetton teammate Alexander Wurz; both drivers complained that their cars had balance and grip issues. The two were split by Pedro Diniz in the other Sauber and Heidfeld. Alesi followed up in 18th. Ricardo Zonta set the 19th fastest time and used BAR's spare car when an engine failure on his race car occurred. Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 20 to 22. After the qualifying session, but before the warm-up period, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate, Charlie Whiting announced that he had banned practice starts at the pit lane exit after observing the drivers' behaviour in the area during the Saturday free practice sessions.|$|E

25|$|In agriculture, {{clinoptilolite}} (a {{naturally occurring}} zeolite) {{is used as}} a soil treatment. It provides a source of slowly released potassium. If previously loaded with ammonium, the zeolite can serve a similar function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> release of nitrogen. Zeolites can also act as water moderators, in which they will absorb up to 55% of their weight in water and slowly release it under the plant's demand. This property can prevent root rot and moderate drought cycles.|$|E

25|$|Manichaeism conceives of two coexistent {{realms of}} light and {{darkness}} that become embroiled in conflict. Certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness, {{and the purpose of}} material creation is to engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> process of extraction of these individual elements. In the end the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism inherits this dualistic mythology from Zurvanist Zoroastrianism, in which the eternal spirit Ahura Mazda is opposed by his antithesis, Angra Mainyu. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of a primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.|$|E
