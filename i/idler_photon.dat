50|$|In other words, {{even though}} an <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> is not {{observed}} until long after its entangled signal photon arrives at D0 {{due to the}} shorter optical path for the latter, interference at D0 is determined by whether a signal photon's entangled <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> is detected at a detector that preserves its which-path information (D3 or D4), or at a detector that erases its which-path information (D1 or D2).|$|E
40|$|Using {{the signal}} and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> {{produced}} by parametric downconversion, we report an experimental observation of {{a violation of}} the Bell inequality for energy and time based purely on the geometric phases of the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons.</b> We thus show that energy-time entanglement between the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> can be explored by means of their geometric phases. These results may have important practical implications for quantum information science by providing an additional means by which entanglement can be manipulated. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5000|$|Moreover, the {{apparent}} retroactive action vanishes if {{the effects of}} observations {{on the state of}} the entangled signal and idler photons are considered in the historic order. Specifically, in the case when detection/deletion of which-way information happens before the detection on D0, the standard simplistic explanation says [...] "The detector Di, at which the <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> is detected, determines the probability distribution at D0 for the signal photon". Similarly, in the case when D0 precedes detection of the <b>idler</b> <b>photon,</b> the following description is just as accurate: [...] "The position at D0 of the detected signal photon determines the probabilities for the <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> to hit either of D1, D2, D3 or D4". These are just equivalent ways of formulating the correlations of entangled photons' observables in an intuitive causal way, so one may choose any of those (in particular, that one where the cause precedes the consequence and no retrograde action appears in the explanation).|$|E

50|$|Detection {{of signal}} photons at D0 does not {{directly}} yield any which-path information. Detection of <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> at D3 or D4, which provide which-path information, means that no interference pattern {{can be observed in}} the jointly detected subset of signal photons at D0. Likewise, detection of <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> at D1 or D2, which do not provide which-path information, means that interference patterns can be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal photons at D0.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a strong {{infrared}} laser beam obliquely incident on graphene can experience a parametric instability with respect to decay into lower-frequency (<b>idler)</b> <b>photons</b> and THz surface plasmons. The instability {{is due to a}} strong in-plane second-order nonlinear response of graphene which originates from its spatial dispersion. The parametric decay leads to efficient generation of THz plasmons and gives rise to quantum entanglement of <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> and surface plasmon states. A similar process can be supported by surface states of topological insulators such as Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $. Comment: The submission contains the paper and three figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{optical path}} length {{measured}} from slit to D1, D2, D3, and D4 is 2.5 m longer than the {{optical path length}} from slit to D0. This means that any information that one can learn from an <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> must be approximately 8 ns later than what one can learn from its entangled signal photon.|$|E
5000|$|Some have {{interpreted}} this result {{to mean that}} the delayed choice to observe or not observe {{the path of the}} <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> changes the outcome of an event in the past. [...] Note in particular that an interference pattern may only be pulled out for observation after the idlers have been detected (i.e., at D1 or D2).|$|E
5000|$|Delayed choice {{experiments}} {{raise questions}} about time and time sequences, and thereby bring our usual ideas of time and causal sequence into question. [...] If events at D1, D2, D3, D4 determine outcomes at D0, then effect seems to precede cause. If the idler light paths were greatly extended so that a year goes by before a photon shows up at D1, D2, D3, or D4, then when a photon shows {{up in one of}} these detectors, it would cause a signal photon to have shown up in a certain mode a year earlier. Alternatively, knowledge of the future fate of the <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> would determine the activity of the signal photon in its own present. Neither of these ideas conforms to the usual human expectation of causality. However, knowledge of the future, which would be a hidden variable, was refuted in experiments.|$|E
50|$|The total {{pattern of}} signal photons {{at the primary}} {{detector}} never shows interference (see Fig. 5), {{so it is not}} possible to deduce what will happen to the <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> by observing the signal photons alone. The delayed choice quantum eraser does not communicate information in a retro-causal manner because it takes another signal, one which must arrive via a process that can go no faster than the speed of light, to sort the superimposed data in the signal photons into four streams that reflect the states of the <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> at their four distinct detection screens.|$|R
50|$|By using a {{coincidence}} counter, the experimenters {{were able to}} isolate the entangled signal from photo-noise, recording only events where both signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> were detected (after compensating for the 8 ns delay). Refer to Figs 3 and 4.|$|R
40|$|We {{employ a}} quasimode {{representation}} of the adjoint master equation to study nonlinear pair-generation dynamics via spontaneous four-wave mixing in coupled-cavity systems {{in the presence of}} scattering loss. Perturbative analytic solutions for signal and idler photon-number operators are derived, which enable us to examine the effect of scattering loss on pair-generation dynamics. In particular, for a simple three-mode system, we show that any loss mismatch for the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> increases the probability of finding unpaired photons. While decreasing the loss rates for signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> increases the pair signal brightness, it also results in higher generation rates for multiple pairs in the system, which can result in lower operational signal-to-noise ratios. 12 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The delayed choice quantum eraser {{experiment}} {{performed by}} Marlan Scully involves pairs of entangled photons that {{are divided into}} [...] "signal photons" [...] and [...] "idler photons", with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the double-slit experiment. Depending on how the <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> is measured, the experimenter can either learn {{which of the two}} locations the signal photon emerged from or [...] "erase" [...] that information. Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons, the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an interference pattern is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons. However, since interference can only be observed after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons, there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons, only by gathering classical information from the entire system; thus causality is preserved.|$|E

Our experiment shows that the well-understood non-diffracting behavior of a BG beam may be directly mapped to the signal-mode, single photons heralded by the detection of a single <b>idler</b> <b>photon.</b> In our experiment, the heralded single photon is thus arranged to be non-diffracting without the need for projecting its single-photon transverse amplitude, post-generation, in any manner.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{temporal}} two-photon interference effects involving the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> created by parametric down-conversion can be fully characterized {{in terms of}} the variations of two length parameters [...] called the biphoton path-length difference and the biphoton path-asymmetry- length difference [...] which we construct using the six different length parameters that a general two-photon interference experiment involves. We perform an experiment in which the effects of the variations of these two parameters can be independently controlled and studied. In our experimental setup, which does not involve mixing of signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photons</b> at a beam splitter, we further report observations of Hong-Ou-Mandel- (HOM-) like effects both in coincidence and in one-photon count rates. As an important consequence, we argue that the HOM and the HOM-like effects are best described as observations of how two-photon coherence changes {{as a function of the}} biphoton path- asymmetry-length difference.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectral {{properties of the}} biphoton state from the cascade emissions of cold atomic ensembles, which composes of a telecommunication photon (signal) followed by an infrared one (idler) via four-wave mixing. With adiabatic conditions for Gaussian driving pulses of width τ, the spectrum of the biphoton state has {{the form of a}} Gaussian that conserves signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> energies within ħ/τ modulated by a Lorentzian with a superradiant linewidth. Multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency-shifted cascade emissions, we may manipulate and shape the spectrum of the biphoton state. The entropy of entanglement is derived from Schmidt decomposition, which can be larger if we multiplex the atomic ensembles in a way that conserves signal and <b>idler</b> <b>photon</b> central energies. The eigenvalues in Schmidt bases are degenerate in pairs for symmetric spectral shaping in which the mode probability densities show interference patterns. We also demonstrate the excess entropy of entanglement that comes from continuous frequency space, which scales up the total entropy. The scheme of multiplexed cascade-emitted biphoton state provides multimode structures that are useful in long-distance quantum communication and multimode quantum information processing.

40|$|In {{a hybrid}} quantum network, linking {{two kinds of}} quantum nodes through {{photonic}} channels requires excellent matching of central frequency and bandwidth between both nodes and their interfacing photons.
