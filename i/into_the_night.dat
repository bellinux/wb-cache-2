5000|$|As {{anticipated}} by the judges, Tiara {{was eliminated}} from the competition, before the [...] "Rock"-themed performances commenced, in which contestants perform a song of the rock genre, or modify a non-rock song to fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night's</b> theme as done by Joni and Shila.|$|R
5|$|A {{young man}} tunnels {{out of a}} {{farmhouse}} in Oregon City, Oregon, escaping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> He finds an abandoned car and attempts to hot-wire it; someone inside starts the engine and run him off the road, injuring his ankle. A woman, face obscured, and her male accomplice exit the car and throw the man into its trunk.|$|E
5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains {{immobile}} in {{his chair}} all day due to a hernia which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile in his seat well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron {{out to the car}} on his office chair to bring him to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Bruce gains Rachel's respect but {{loses her}} love, as she decides she cannot {{be with him}} while he is Batman. Bruce buys a {{controlling}} stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police Department, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Australian magpie {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} diurnal, {{although it may}} call <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> like some {{other members of the}} Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting. The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{feature of}} Solar Two was {{its use of}} molten salt to capture and store the sun's heat. The very hot salt was stored and used when needed to produce steam to drive a turbine/generator that {{produces}} electricity. The system operated smoothly through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into CACTUS, an Air Cherenkov Telescope, in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|A final {{showdown}} ensues with Lazarus, {{in which}} Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given {{for him to}} side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
50|$|Many {{tales of}} the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) {{can be traced to}} medieval Egyptian {{storytelling}} traditions. These tales were probably in circulation before they were collected and codified into a single collection. Medieval Egyptian folklore was one of three distinct layers of storytelling which were incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> by <b>the</b> 15th century, the other two being ancient Indian and Persian folklore, and stories from Abbasid-era Baghdad.|$|R

5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{started with}} Landells in 1840. His duties {{included}} delivering proofs of drawings {{to be approved}} by artists such as Edward Dalziel, or authors such as Charles Dickens. A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket Foster, John Greenaway and George Dalziel. Foster and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and Foster to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work late <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> and return early in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working late <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton {{had gone to bed}} exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{worked in the}} {{wreckage}} all day and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> {{in an effort to}} find and rescue any children pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
