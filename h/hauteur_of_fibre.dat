40|$|The OFDA 4000 {{is a new}} {{instrument}} for the measurement <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length and diameter of wool tops. The instrument has undergone several modifications and improvements since {{it was first reported}} at the Barcelona IWTO meeting. The instrument can measure various fibre types in sliver form and now has the capacity to measure fibre snippets on the 70 mm glass slides as used by the OFDA 100. The OFDA 4000 measurements were compared to Almeter measurements on 43 commercial tops. The OFDA 4000 estimates <b>of</b> <b>hauteur</b> and CvH closely matched those of the Almeter. Because the OFDA 4000 directly counts fibres within the drawn sample, another estimate <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> length distribution can be determined (now called mean fibre length).

40|$|International audienceA {{model to}} predict {{the effects of the}} {{accumulation}} <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> breakages in unidirectional carbon fibre composites has been developed that takes into account several physical phenomena controlling fibre failure, including the stochastic nature <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> strength, stress transfer between fibres due to the shear of the matrix, interfacial debonding and viscosity of the matrix.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of diameter, length and melting point <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> on {{spalling}} protection of concrete in fire. Three different diameters (0. 012, 0. 02 and 0. 04 mm), three different lengths (9, 12 and 19 mm) and two different types (nylon and polypropylene) <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> were investigated. Fibre volume (v%) or fibre weight per unit volume of concrete are commonly used parameters for fibre addition, but are dependent parameters on diameter <b>of</b> <b>fibres.</b> This study reports a better parameter for the expression <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> addition which is independent of diameter, namely, number <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> per cubic centimeter (N). When 12 mm length polypropylene fibre addition is expressed by v%, the minimum requirement for spalling protection is v = 0. 20 % for 0. 04 mm diameter fibres and v = 0. 05 % for 0. 02 mm diameter fibres. If the fibre addition is expressed in N, the minimum requirement is N = 133 /cm 3 for both cases regardless <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> diameter. Hence, the diameter <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> has limited effect on spalling protection of concrete. If the fibre addition is expressed in v%, the diameter seems {{to have an effect}} {{due to the fact that}} parameter v% is a function of diameter. In addition, increasing the length <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> has {{the effect of}} reducing the required N for spalling protection.

It is clear from the clinical studies that have been reviewed that there remains a paucity of controlled data, and a great deal more research is needed before widespread use <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> supplemented diets can be supported. Perhaps of greater interest academically is the potentially beneficial effects that appear to be exerted by the VFA's, liberated as a consequence of colonic bacterial fermentation <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> on morphology and function of ileal and colonic mucosa.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{measurements were}} obtained {{for a range of}} suspensions <b>of</b> wood pulp <b>fibre</b> flowing through a pipeline. Data were generated over a selected range of flow rates and temperatures from a specially built flow loop. It was found that the magnitude of the heat transfer coefficient was above water at equivalent experimental conditions at very low fibre concentrations, but progressively decreased until it was below water at slightly higher concentrations. It was found that the heat transfer was affected by varying fibre properties, such as fibre length, fibre flexibility, fibre chemical and mechanical treatment, the variation <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> from different parts of the tree as well as the different pulping methods used to liberate the fibres from the wood structure. Heat transfer coefficient was decreased with the increasing <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> flexibility as found by previous workers.
