5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to <b>grow</b> on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to <b>grow</b> on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may <b>grow</b> solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may <b>grow</b> on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E

All measurements were made during the <b>growing</b> season. We measured B plots in 2003 (one <b>growing</b> season after burning); 2005 (three <b>growing</b> seasons after burning); 2006 (one <b>growing</b> season after the second burn); 2011 (one <b>growing</b> season before the third burn); and 2012, 2013, and 2014 (one, two, and three <b>growing</b> seasons after the third burn, respectively). We measured M plots in 2002 (one <b>growing</b> season after felling); 2004 (three <b>growing</b> seasons after felling); 2006 (five <b>growing</b> seasons after felling); 2011 (one <b>growing</b> season before the second felling); and 2012, 2013, and 2014 (one, two and three <b>growing</b> seasons after the second felling, respectively). The MB plots were measured in 2002 (one <b>growing</b> season after felling); 2003 (one <b>growing</b> season after burning); 2005 (three <b>growing</b> seasons after burning); 2006 (one <b>growing</b> season after the second burn); 2011 (one <b>growing</b> season before the third burn); and 2012, 2013, and 2014 (one, two, and three <b>growing</b> seasons after the third burn, respectively).

5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi <b>grow</b> as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes <b>grow</b> as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, <b>grow</b> by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} <b>grow</b> {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus <b>grow</b> around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E

40|$|The timing, length, {{and thermal}} {{intensity}} of the climatic <b>growing</b> season in China show statistically significant changes over the period of 1955 to 2000. Nationally, the average start of the <b>growing</b> season has shifted 4. 6 - 5. 5 days earlier while the average end has moved 1. 8 - 3. 7 days later, increasing {{the length of the}} <b>growing</b> season by 6. 9 - 8. 7 days depending on the base temperature chosen. The thermal {{intensity of the}} <b>growing</b> season has increased by 74. 9 - 196. 8 <b>growing</b> degree-days, depending on the base temperature selected. The spatial characteristics of the change in the timing and length of the <b>growing</b> season differ from the geographical pattern of change in temperatures over this period; but the spatial characteristics of change in <b>growing</b> degree-days does resemble the pattern for temperatures, with higher rates in northern regions. Nationally, two distinct regimes are evident over time: an initial period where <b>growing</b> season indicators fluctuate near a base period average, and a second period of rapidly increasing <b>growing</b> season length and thermal intensity. <b>Growing</b> degree-days are highly correlated with March-to-November mean air temperatures in all climatic regions of China; the length of the <b>growing</b> season is likewise highly correlated with March-to-November mean air temperatures except in east, southeast and southwest China at base temperature of 0 A degrees C and southeast China at base temperature of 5 A degrees C. The <b>growing</b> season start date appears to have the greater influence on the length of the <b>growing</b> season.
