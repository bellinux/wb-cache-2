50|$|CBSG's work in {{conservation}} {{is based on}} a central philosophy: that people from many different backgrounds and perspectives are required to address the global biodiversity crisis. Therefore, CBSG emphasizes the exchange of information across diverse groups to reach agreement on the important challenges facing humans and wildlife.

CBSG's workshop “toolkit” for conservation professionals is based on using sound scientific principles, and promotes the creative use of new information to refine existing wildlife management practices. Through developing a broad understanding of challenges and alternative solutions, workshop participants can produce meaningful and practical management recommendations that generate political and social support for conservation action—from local communities to national political authorities. Timely production of workshop reports has immediate impact on stakeholders and decision makers.|$|E

40|$|Automatically {{determining}} {{the situation of}} an ad-hoc group of people and devices within a smart environment is a significant challenge in pervasive computing systems. Current approaches often rely on an <b>environment</b> <b>expert</b> to correlate the situations that occur with the available sensor data, while other machine learning based approaches require long training periods before the system can be used.

The patients gives set of symptoms which the patient observes. Depending on the set of symptoms selected the system selects a disease. We give the input as the set of symptoms and the output is a disease. The system can be further enhanced by using a layer of medicines for the diseases. On recognizing the disease, the system can then further select a medicine. The system can be used in emergency situations where medical consultation is not easily available...|$|E
