40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of the drying air temperature on the essential oil content from sliced Melaleuca alternifólia Cheel. Three samples were taken randomly from each treatment and analyzed fresh, evaluating the water content and chemical composition. The samples were then cooled in the B. O. D at 2 °C until drying. For the performance of drying tests an updraft fixed-bed dryer was used, equipped with a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) burner for heating of the drying air. The air velocity was 0, 5 ± 0. 03 ms- 1 and the relative humidity at the <b>dryer</b> <b>entrance</b> was 65 %. The air drying temperatures were 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C. Three repetitions of each drying test were done using 500 g of the sliced plant made into 5 cm thick layers. The essential oil was extracted by steam distillation in three hours. There was no statistical difference between the drying treatments, however, when compared to the fresh plant, a reduction of 18. 19 % in oil content was observed compared to the dried samples in the different temperatures...|$|E
