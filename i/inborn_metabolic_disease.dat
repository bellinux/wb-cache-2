40|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase {{deficiency}} is an X linked {{disorder and}} the most common inherited cause of hyperammonaemia. Fluctuating concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, and other excitotoxic amino acids result in a chronic or episodically recurring encephalopathy. A heterozygous female patient first presented with protein intolerance, attacks of vomiting, and signs of mental retardation in early childhood. At the age of 16 complex partial seizures occurred which were treated with sodium valproate. Seven days after initiation of valproate therapy, she developed severe hyperammonaemic encephalopathy with deep somnolence. The maximum concentration of ammonia was 480 µmol/l. After withdrawal of valproate, three cycles of plasma dialysis, and initiation of a specific therapy for the <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease,</b> ammonia concentrations fell to normal values. The patient remitted, returning to her premorbid state. Valproate can cause high concentrations of ammonia in serum in patients with normal urea cycle enzymes and may worsen a pre-existing hyperammonaemia caused by an enzymatic defect of the urea cycle. Sufficient diagnostic tests {{for the detection of}} metabolic disorders must be performed before prescribing valproate for patients with a history of encephalopathy. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is general}} {{knowledge}} that glycaemia {{is affected by}} digested nutrients. Amino acids intake {{appears to be an}} important regulator in this regard. Many questions need to be answered, such as the real mediators of this responseand the mechanisms underlying this metabolic behavior. Studies have been undertaken in order to investigate the role of amino acids on metabolic parameters. Their main fndings suggest that the ingestion of free aminoacids have a pivotal role in avoiding glycaemia excursions, improving glucosetolerance. In parallel, several important molecules for glucose metabolism have been exploited. Insulin and glucagon-like peptide - 1 (GLP- 1) release seemto be the main triggers of this response. This insulinogenic effect is attributed to some amino acids, particularly the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). GLP- 1 may exert its effects by activating its receptor inpancreas and enhancing insulin release by β-cells or through its extrapancreaticactions. The mechanisms that may justify the aforementioned effects remainto be answered, being the mTOR pathway activation a possible key. Thesemetabolic effects may have a special interest within the nutritional management of Phenylketonuria (PKU), an <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease</b> of phenylalanine (Phe) catabolism.

40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an <b>inborn,</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease</b> {{affecting}} the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Since 1965, all Swedish patients {{are treated with}} a diet from the neonatal period, while patients without treatment become severely mentally retarded. This thesis presents {{a recent survey of}} intelligence, adjustment, and coping among Swedish patients with PKU aged 8 - 19 years. In Study I the patients’ blood phenylalanine level was in accordance with treatment norms and they were normal in terms of intelligence and adjustment. The next study was a comparison of adjustment between patients with PKU, patients with neurobehavioral disorders, and patients with obesity. A reference group with matched non-clinical children was included. In this comparison, patients with PKU did not differ from the healthy children. Patients with neurobehavioral disorders were the least adjusted, and patients with obesity differed from the reference group and from patients with PKU in some respects, indicating less work capacity and internalising problems. Study II was undertaken for methodological reasons and showed that the measure of adjustment was reliable and valid. Study III was an investigation of psychological mechanisms associated with adherence to the dietetic therapy in PKU. The results showed that parents’ problem-focused coping was the main factor behind good adherence. A marked transition to self-care was recommended to enhance the patients’ motivation to continue with the diet into adulthood. This thesis concludes that the good outcome among the Swedish patients is due to general improvement of the treatment, but a contributing factor can be the high and fairly equal standards of living in the Swedish society...|$|E

40|$|Fatty-acid {{metabolism}} plays a {{key role}} in acquired and <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> To obtain insight into the network dynamics of fatty-acid beta-oxidation, we constructed a detailed computational model of the pathway and subjected it to a fat overload condition. The model contains reversible and saturable enzyme-kinetic equations and experimentally determined parameters for rat-liver enzymes. It was validated by adding palmitoyl CoA or palmitoyl carnitine to isolated rat-liver mitochondria: without refitting of measured parameters, the model correctly predicted the beta-oxidation flux as well as the time profiles of most acyl-carnitine concentrations. Subsequently, we simulated the condition of obesity by increasing the palmitoyl-CoA concentration. At a high concentration of palmitoyl CoA the beta-oxidation became overloaded: the flux dropped and metabolites accumulated. This behavior originated from the competition between acyl CoAs of different chain lengths for a set of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases with overlapping substrate specificity. This effectively induced competitive feedforward inhibition and thereby led to accumulation of CoA-ester intermediates and depletion of free CoA (CoASH). The mitochondrial [NAD(+) ]/[NADH] ratio modulated the sensitivity to substrate overload, revealing a tight interplay between regulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial respiration. ...|$|R

In a series of 102 cases of neonatal hypertyros-inemia, the test has proven to be highly discriminative for hereditary tyrosinemia. It has permitted earlydetectionof eight cases of this disease, including two that would have been missed by the previously used screening procedure, tyrosine measurement only. The test not only virtually eliminates the risk of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis, but also permits earlier diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia and considerably reduces the follow-up work required for newborns with transitory tyrosinemia. The AFP test is simple, fast, practical, and inexpensive. Combined with tyrosine determination, it constitutes an optimal device for mass screening of hereditary tyrosinemia. Hereditary tyrosinemia is an autosomal recessive <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease</b> that has a relatively high prevalence in the Province of Quebec.

This means {{that it is possible to}} remain overweight without a calorie intake that exceeds that of those individuals of normal weight who lack the genetic susceptibility of obesity. Treatment is recommended from 10 years of age with a hypocaloric diet (1500 kcal) and a reduced fat content (30 energy-percent). Exercise is often obtained naturally by the child before this age. It is helpful to try to replace a sedentary lifestyle including television-viewing with moderate physical activities such as walking. In introducing these changes in lifestyle family therapy has been effective. Other strategies such as behavioural therapy has also been tried individually or in groups or at school with short-term benefits only.

40|$|Studies of rare, <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{establish}} that the phenotypes of some mutations in vitamin-dependent enzymes can be suppressed by supplementation of the cognate vitamin, which restores {{function of the}} defective enzyme. To determine whether polymorphisms exist that more subtly affect enzymes yet are augmentable in the same way, we sequenced the coding region of a prototypical vitamin-dependent enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), from 564 individuals of diverse ethnicities. All nonsynonymous changes were evaluated in functional in vivo assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify enzymatic defects and folate remediability of impaired alleles. We identified 14 nonsynonymous changes: 11 alleles with minor allele frequencies < 1 % and 3 common alleles (A 222 V, E 429 A, and R 594 Q). Four of 11 low-frequency alleles affected enzyme function, as did A 222 V. Of the five impaired alleles, four could be restored to normal functionality by elevating intracellular folate levels. All five impaired alleles mapped to the N-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme, whereas changes in the C-terminal regulatory domain {{had little effect on}} activity. Impaired activity correlated with the phosphorylation state of MTHFR, with more severe mutations resulting in lower abundance of the phosphorylated protein. Significantly, diploid yeast heterozygous for mutant alleles were impaired for growth, particularly with lower folate supplementation. These results suggested that multiple less-frequent alleles, in aggregate, might significantly contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, vitamin remediation of mutant enzymes may be a common phenomenon in certain domains of proteins...|$|R
40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) are two <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{which are}} carried by {{autosomal}} recessive genes in man.

As a result in many countries screening of infants for MSUD and PKU, by measuring plasma amino acids has become a routine neonatal test. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) assays have a number of advantages over the traditional chromatography techniques (such as GC or HPLC). These include low cost, high speed of analysis and high resolution. These characteristics, make CE an ideal method for the screening of inborn errors of metabolism.

In contrast to other series in which R 141 H represents 43 - 50 % of the alleles, only 9 / 36 (25 %) alleles have this mutation. Two mutations (R 123 Q and T 237 M) have been found on three disease chromosomes, four (V 44 A, Y 64 C, P 113 L and F 207 S) on two disease chromosomes and 12 mutations (D 65 Y, Y 76 C, IVS 3 + 2 C>T, E 93 A, R 123 X, V 129 M, I 153 T, F 157 S, E 197 A, N 216 I, T 226 S, C 241 S) only on one disease chromosome.

In the course of liver cell transplantation particle based delivery systems (PDS) consisting of iron oxide particles incorporated in liver cells might provide a tool for combination of diagnosis and therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} design a multifunctional oligonucleotide-labeled biocompatible micron-sized iron oxide particle (sMPIO-α-LNA), which combines MRI cell tracking and therapeutic manipulation of primary human hepatocytes by miRNA targeting. The sMPIO consisted of nanometer-scaled magnetite-particles, which were distributed homogenously in a silica-based polymer matrix. The polymeric shell was covered with carboxyl groups allowing the binding of functional groups and therapeutic agents. In this study antisense locked nucleic acids (α-LNA) were covalently bound to the surface of the sMPIO. The main purpose of the sMPIO was to enable a reproducible hypointense MRI signal. Therefore two different surface modifications (Poly-L-Lysin, Streptavidin), which were coupled onto particle surfaces, were tested regarding the incorporation capacity into liver cells. The results showed that 1, 000 primary hepatocytes and 5, 000 cells of the cell line Huh- 7 could be quantified in a T 2 * weighted imaging. In order to cause an intracellular stimulus of transplanted hepatocytes, a α-LNA specific for the depletion of the microRNA (miRNA) Let 7 g was covalently bound to the particle surface. The Let 7 g depletion (80 %) resulted in up-regulation of the cell cycle associated target proteins Cyclin-D 1 and c-Myc. In further proteome analyses, additional target proteins, which were regulated by sMPIO-α-LNA treatment, were detected. Four of them were identified as interaction partners of Let 7 g. The transplantation of sMPIO-labeled cells caused an enhanced signal loss in MRI after seven days.

Their concentrations vary physiologically with age but also in diseases such as inflammation, neoplastic tumours or in inborn genetic disorders causing abnormal sialic acid metabolism. Determination of free and bound sialic acids in urine using the thiobarbituric acid method according to Warren (J Biol Chem 1959; 234 : 1971 — 5) was shown to be useful for the diagnosis of diseases that involve sialic acid metabolic disorders. This test — also used for the diagnosis of <b>inborn</b> errors of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as sialidosis, infantile sialic acid storage disease, Salla's disease, neuraminidase deficiency and others — {{should be included in the}} selective screening for storage diseases.

Acutely ill Reye's syndrome patients had elevated levels of serum ornithine carbamyl transferase activities as compared to those in controls. The convalescent Reye's syndrome patients and their parents had normal levels of serum ornithine carbamyl transferase activities. These results suggest that an <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> defect was {{not responsible for the}} increase in serum ornithine carbamyl transferase activities in Reye's syndrome...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and obesity, are {{associated}} with a low-grade chronic inflammation (inflammatory stress), oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Because the integration of these stresses is critical to the pathogenesis of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> agents and cellular molecules that can modulate these stress responses are emerging as potential targets for intervention and treatment of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> It has been recognized that heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) {{plays an important role in}} cellular protection. Because HO- 1 can reduce inflammatory stress, oxidative stress, and ER stress, in part by exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects, HO- 1 has been suggested to play important roles in pathogenesis of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> In the present review, we will explore our current understanding of the protective mechanisms of HO- 1 in <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> and present some emerging therapeutic options for HO- 1 expression in treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> together with the therapeutic potential of curcumin and resveratrol analogues that have their ability to induce HO- 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|Impaired glucose {{homeostasis}} {{is one of}} the risk factors for causing <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancers. In glucose metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) mediates a major regulatory step, an irreversible reaction of oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Tight control of PDC is critical because it {{plays a key role in}} glucose disposal. PDC activity is tightly regulated using phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK 1 to 4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP 1 and 2). PDKs and PDPs exhibit unique tissue expression patterns, kinetic properties, and sensitivities to regulatory molecules. During the last decades, the up-regulation of PDKs has been observed in the tissues of patients and mammals with <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> which suggests that the inhibition of these kinases may have beneficial effects for treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review summarizes the recent advances in the role of specific PDK isoenzymes on the induction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> and describes the effects of PDK inhibition on the prevention of <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases</b> using pharmacological inhibitors. Based on these reports, PDK isoenzymes are strong therapeutic targets for preventing and treating <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hyperhomocysteinemia is an {{independent}} risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is either an <b>inborn</b> <b>metabolic</b> defect or acquired. Main causes are either a defective homocysteine remethylation (thermolability of the enzyme 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) or nutritional deficiencies of B vitamins especially folic acid. The relative risk for myocardial infarction has been found of 3, 1 in case of hyperhomocysteinemia. It is considered that a 5 μM/l homocysteine increment elevates vascular risk {{by as much as}} cholesterol increases of 20 mg/dl. B vitamins supplements are potentially useful.
