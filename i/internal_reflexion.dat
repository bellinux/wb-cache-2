We characterized the saturation intensity and the maximum number of fluorescence photons for single BODIPY-FL in a usual buffer. We then studied the influence of the buffer depletion in oxygen and the addition of redox agents on the brightness and the lifetime before photobleaching of the BODIPY-FL. The great improvement of these two factors in such a medium allows the use of BODIPY-FL in single-molecule biophysics experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of bubble solitons in two-dimensional isotropic antiferromagnets, inhomogeneously doped {{so that the}} exchange integral J becomes position dependent, is studied. In the usual continuum approximation, the system reduces to a nonlinear sigma model on a spacetime whose geometry depends on J(x). It is shown, both within the geodesic approximation, and by appealing to field theoretic conservation laws, that a bubble incident on a domain-wall inhomogeneity undergoes refraction in accordance with Snell's law, 1 /J being identified with the refractive index, and that sufficiently oblique impacts result in total <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion.</b> Possible applications of this phenomenon {{to the construction of}} bubble lenses and bubble guides(in analogy with fibre-optic cables) are considered.

40|$|We {{consider}} the guiding of a few-cycle optical soliton by total <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion,</b> in a planar geometry. By means of numerical solution of a cubic generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, we show that, for intensities {{high enough to}} induce soliton formation, the nonlinear effects considerably widen the guided mode and can even prevent guiding for the shortest pulses and the narrowest waveguides. However, waveguiding {{can be achieved by}} means of a steep variation of the nonlinear coefficients, e. g., by using a higher nonlinear coefficient in the cladding than that in the waveguide core. We further propose an analytical approach for extremely narrow guides, which allows us to derive a modified Korteweg–de Vries-type model for the propagation of few-cycle optical solitons in the planar waveguide...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we first}} {{describe}} an original experimental device, which {{enables us to}} isolate shear waves and thus to evaluate their attenuation by a plane-wave angular spectrum decomposition of the transmitted beam. In a second step, we propose a method to characterize the material's stiffness tensor in its complex form, the imaginary part of the elastic constants being a function of frequency. Toward this end, the overall transmission coefficient, including the infinite series of <b>internal</b> <b>reflexions,</b> is calculated in oblique incidence and in immersion using the recursive stiffness matrix method coupled with the Stroh formalism. This modeling was chosen because it showed to be computationally stable and efficient for any anisotropic medium, even beyond the critical angles. Experimental results obtained on orthotropic austenitic stainless steel samples will be presented, and discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of reconstructed silicon wafers {{obtained}} {{after high}} temperature annealing under H- 2 atmosphere was demonstrated as an efficient way {{for increasing the}} bonding energy of silicon hydrophobic bonding (Rauer et al. 2013). Mechanisms occurring in these bondings {{are the focus of}} this paper. Si bonding interface closure was analyzed at the nanometer scale using X-Ray Reflectivity and Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy in multiple <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion</b> mode. These two characterization techniques enable one to follow the interface closure taking under consideration mechanical and chemical aspects. We have shown that the terrace morphology and the monohydride surface termination specific to reconstructed Si surfaces both play a role in obtaining an efficient bonding gap closure after annealing at low temperature...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} flow fields {{on the strength of}} the depletion interaction caused by disc-shaped depletants. At low mass concentration of discs, it is possible to continuously decrease the depth of the depletion potential by increasing the applied shear rate until the depletion force is not perceivable experimentally. Above a threshold in the platelet mass concentration, the depletion potential can no longer be affected by flow in the accessible range of shear rates. While the observed decrease of depletion strength at low depletant concentration may be ascribed to flow alignment of the discs, it is not clear why the influence of flow is vanishing at high concentrations. In order to observe these effects, a modification of the established total <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion</b> microscopy (TIRM) technique is be implemented. We show the suitability of these modifications to measure particle-wall interaction potentials under non-equilibrium conditions for systems where particles are exposed to a shear...|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} pH mapping derived from optical sensors similar to total {{internal}} reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) has been developed for future possible applications {{in the field of}} localized corrosion. The sensing principle is the increase of the fluorescent yield of the fluorescein with the pH of the medium. The basic principle of this sensor is based on the excitation of a fluorescent silica polymer film of nanometre dimensions, deposited by sol–gel method on a waveguiding layer. The total <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion</b> conditions creates an evanescent wave which interacts with the molecules trapped in the silica layer. A conventional microscope located above the sample collects the fluorescence emitted by this sensing layer. An original application of this type of sensor is proposed for studying the concentration profile of chemical species in an occluded electrochemical cell using a very simple type of waveguide. This method takes advantages of the confinement and strong intensity of the field over a few hundred nanometres {{below the surface of the}} waveguide thus allowing local analysis and imaging of the concentration profiles of chemical species in this volume...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the end of}} 2007, ASN {{launched}} an <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion</b> on the information of the public on the radioactivity levels in the environment. The aim {{was to develop a}} radioactivity environment scale or index, based on existing scales used for air pollution. After the presentation of a demonstration model by ASN in 2008 to HCTISN, a working group (WG) was constituted in the beginning of 2009 by ASN with stakeholders with the approval in March 2009 of the goals to be reached by this index: a communication instrument to qualify the information of the radioactivity levels in the environment, consistent with INES, particularly when sanitary consequences may occur, easy to elaborate from the available measured values of radioactivity and always usable for any location, independently of an incidental or accidental situation. 1. THE BACKGROUND In order to better inform the public on radioactivity levels in the environment and their effects, ASN embarked on an internal thinking process, in late 2007, to develop a radioactivity environment scale or index, based on existing scales used for air pollution. Like any communication scale, the aim is to give the public immediate information on what one or more measurement results mean. At the same time, the High Council on Transparency and Information on Nuclear Safety (HCTISN) ...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the {{international}} liquid crystal conference, Bangalore, 1973. The Freedericksz transition associated with a twist distortion in a nematic liquid crystal cannot be detected optically when viewed along the twist axis. Because of this difficulty, there have not been any direct determinations of the twist elastic constant k 22 {{as a function of}} temperature except for the well-known studies of Freedericksz and Tsvetkov who used a total <b>internal</b> <b>reflexion</b> technique. Optical theory shows that an important parameter in determining the behaviour of such a medium is the ratio of the retardation (=π ▲n/λ, where ▲n is the birefringence of the untwisted medium) to the twist per unit length. For light propagation along the twist axis, ▲n is large and it can be shown that with the usual experimental geometry in which the director is anchored to the walls at either end, the twist does not reveal itself in transmitted light. On the other hand, when ▲n is small the optical properties of the medium are very sensitive to distortions. To reduce the effective ▲n, observations were made in a direction in- clined at a large angle to the twist axis. The Freedericksz transition could then be detected easily. Experimental values of k 22 determined by this method are presented for a few compounds. The critical divergence of k 22 {{in the vicinity of the}} smectic A-nematic transition point in p-cyanobenzylidene-p´-octyloxyaniline has been studied and is discussed in the light of de Gennes's theory...|$|E
