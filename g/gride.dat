'But old Arthur <b>Gride</b> and matrimony {{is a most}} anomalous {{conjunction of}} words; old Arthur <b>Gride</b> and dark eyes and eyelashes, and lips that {{to look at is}} to long to kiss, and clustering hair that he wants to play with, and waists that he wants to span, and little feet that don't tread upon anything--old Arthur <b>Gride</b> and such things as these is more monstrous still; but old Arthur <b>Gride</b> marrying the daughter of a ruined [...] "dashing man" [...] in the Rules of the Bench, is the most monstrous and incredible of all. Plainly, friend Arthur <b>Gride,</b> if you want any help from me in this business (which of course you do, or you would not be here), speak out, and to the purpose. And, above all, don't talk to me of its turning to my advantage, for I know it must turn to yours also, and to a good round tune too, or you would have no finger in such a pie as this.' ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that the filter-design problem with mask {{constraints}} can be formulated as a semi-infinite program. There are two approaches toward the solution of this semi-infinite program. The first <b>griding</b> approach relaxes the semi-infinite con-straint by refining it in the finite <b>griding</b> domain so it does not al-ways guarantee global optimal and feasible solution. The second semi-definite programming (SDP) -based approach does guarantee the global optimal solution and excellently handles positive real constraints. However, the magnitude constraints are still persis-tent and not yet handled by SDP tool in an efficient manner. In this brief, a new tight polyhedral approximation for semi-infinite constrained domain is proposed. Based on it, we present a new linear-programming-based solution method for filter design, which unlike the <b>griding</b> approach yields global solution and unlike SDP based approach is practical for even long-tap filters. Simulation re-sults confirm the viability of the proposed method. Index Terms—Finite-impulse response (FIR) filter, linear pro-gramming, semi-definite programming. I...|$|R

40|$|A stable 2. 5 D finite {{difference}} time-domain (FDTD) {{scheme is}} developed to study wave propagation in heterogeneous media. On {{example is the}} logging while drilling configuration where small features such as the annulus between the drill pipe and the formation, only about 1 / 10 or even smaller than the wavelength in the steel pipe, affect the wave field significantly. The FDTD scheme proposed in this paper improves computational efficiency and accuracy from three aspects: <b>griding,</b> differencing, and numerical truncation. Coordinate stretching, proving to be more accurate, stable, and easy to implement, is employed to achieve variable <b>griding.</b> A wavelet-based differencing scheme is derived and compared with conventional FDTD schemes with spatial truncation accuracy being 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th order. Because the wavelet-based and higher order FDTD scheme exhibits higher linear dispersion properties, it allows courser <b>griding</b> and is therefore more efficient. Reflections and transmission coefficients estimated from all FDTD schemes at a sharp boundary show that the wavelet-based FDTD solution outperforms the others. Efficient numerical truncation is realized by an anisotropic perfectly matched layer. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Earth Resources LaboratoryMassachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of work of medium and low-pressure gas network by means of conventional steady state simulators and <b>griding</b> contouring software. One of the objectives of analysis of network is searching possibility to extend of system in different pressure regimes, different gas demand of consumers because of developing of new infrastructures. The coupled analysis of networks using classical steady state simulations and <b>griding</b> techniques allow finding the area, where critical velocity of gas has been reached. The main advantages of procedure is possibility to calculation of pressure gradient map, flow velocity map, pressure depression map, the Reynolds number map using simple mathematical grid transformation. The necessary condition to perform such analysis is full description of local coordinates (GIS) in the calculated network. The paper shows methodology for performing such analysis and examples of calculation of medium pressure dense networks. Key words: the analysis of work of medium, gradient map...|$|R

Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml). Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.|$|R
