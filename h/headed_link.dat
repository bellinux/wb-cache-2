Various methods based on inverse kinematics is presented and the applicability of each method for kinematic control of the USM is discussed. The dynamic part of the framework ensures that the velocity references generated by the inverse kinematics method are followed and that the thruster forces are appropriately distributed among the available thrusters.

40|$|Membranes of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, {{an extreme}} {{thermophilic}} archaebacterium, {{are composed of}} unusual bipolar lipids. They consist of macrocyclic tetraethers with two polar <b>heads</b> <b>linked</b> by two hydrophobic C 40 phytanyl chains which {{are thought to be}} arranged as a monolayer in the cytoplasmic membrane. Fractionation of a total lipid-extract from S. acidocaldarius yielded a lipid fraction which forms closed and stable unilamellar liposomes in aqueous media. Beef heart cytochrome c-oxidase could be functionally reconstituted in these liposomes. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a protonmotive force (Δp) across the liposomal membrane was generated of up to - 92 mV. Upon fusion of these proteoliposomes with membrane vesicles of Lactococcus lactis, the Δp generated by cytochrome c-oxidase activity was capable to drive uphill transport of leucine. Electron microscopic analysis indicated that the tetraether lipids form a single monolayer liposome. The results demonstrate that tetraether lipids of archaebacteria can form a suitable matrix for the function of exogenous membrane proteins originating from a regular lipid bilayer. ...|$|R

30|$|In this subsection, {{we define}} a {{constraint}} function {{for the head}} angle of the robot. In particular, we use a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law as the reference angle for the <b>head</b> <b>link.</b> LOS guidance is a much-used method in marine control systems (see, e.g. [27]). In general, guidance-based control strategies are based on defining a reference heading angle for the vehicle through a guidance law and designing a controller to track this angle [27]. Motivated by marine control literature, in [17] based on a simplified model of the snake robot, using cascade systems theory, it was proved that if the heading angle of the snake robot was controlled to the LOS angle, then also {{the position of the}} CM of the robot would converge to the desired path. We will show that a similar guidance-based control strategy can successfully steer the robot towards the desired path. However, we perform the model-based control design based on a more accurate model of the snake robot which does not contain the simplifying assumptions of [17] which are valid for small joint angles.|$|R
3000|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} using the snake robot Wheeko [16]. The robot, which is shown in Figure 2, has 10 identical joint modules, i.e. N= 11 links. Each joint module {{is equipped with a}} set of passive wheels which give the robot anisotropic ground friction properties during motion on flat surfaces. The wheels are able to slip sideways and thus do not introduce nonholonomic velocity constraints in the system. Each joint is driven by a Hitec servo motor (HS- 5955 TG; Hitec RCD USA, Inc., Poway, CA, USA), and the joint angles are measured using magnetic rotary encoders. The motion of the snake robot was measured using a camera-based motion capture system from OptiTrack of type Flex 13 (NaturalPoint, Inc., Corvallis, OR, USA). The system consists of 16 cameras which are sampled at 120 frames per second and which allow reflective markers to be tracked on a submillimetre level. During the experiment, reflective markers were mounted on the <b>head</b> <b>link</b> of the snake robot in order to measure the position (px,N,py,N) and orientation (θ [...]...|$|R

We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2. 5 nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer {{in which the two}} talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole {{at the center of this}} donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R

It consisted in a large RC beam specimen loaded in bending after restrained shrinkage. The specimen is composed of a central thinner part and two massive <b>heads</b> <b>linked</b> by two cylindrical struts that restrained strains due to thermal effects and autogenous shrinkage occurring in the concrete central part. After 8 weeks, the beam was loaded near to its ultimate capacity. The numerical model {{is based on the}} 3 D fibre beam approach, capable of reproducing the response since early ages. The cross-section is discretized into fibres {{to take into account the}} different maturity levels within the crosssection. The analysis is divided into three phases: i) the thermal analysis determines the development of temperatures due to cement hydration and heat transfer, solar radiation and night cooling effects, ii) nonlinear mechanical analysis for early ages including creep, autogenous shrinkage and ageing and iii) nonlinear mechanical analysis for loading phase includes the interaction of normal and shear forces. Performance is compared against experimentation and the development of early age stresses discussed. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{membrane}} of Caldariella acidophila, {{an extreme}} thermophilic archaebacterium, {{is characterized by}} unusual bipolar complex lipids. They consist of two nonequivalent polar <b>heads,</b> <b>linked</b> by a C 40 alkylic component. The molecular organization of these lipids in the plasma membrane is still a matter of study. In this paper, we present current-voltage measurements on artificial bipolar lipid membranes, indicating that molecules are indeed organized as a covalently bound bilayer, in which each molecule is completely stretched and spans its entire thickness. Furthermore, conformational transitions of these artificial membranes (which could be formed only above 70 degrees C from a lipid/squalene dispersion) are analyzed in the 80 to 15 degrees C temperature range. Abrupt variations in capacitance and valinomycin-induced conductance seem to indicate the occurrence {{of at least two}} structural changes. Measurements are also extended to different solvent systems. Results are consistent with the picture of a monolayer bipolar lipid membrane in which few solvent molecules align themselves parallel to the lipophilic chains. The amount of solvent as well as the temperature at which conformational transitions occur, depend on the solvent system in which the lipid is dispersed...|$|R
