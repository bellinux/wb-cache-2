5|$|Later {{structures}} that break the classical theme include the <b>Gothic</b> style boathouse, a <b>Gothic</b> Alcove – now a romantic ruin hidden amongst undergrowth – and a <b>Gothic</b> Chapel, once {{home of the}} village cobbler (and facetiously named St Crispin's) but later used as the estate kennels. A monument dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II was erected on her 60th birthday in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Next {{to nothing}} is {{recorded}} of the Germanic languages spoken in the Empire, {{with the exception}} of <b>Gothic.</b> A phrase of <b>Gothic</b> is quoted in an elegiac couplet from the Latin Anthology, and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into <b>Gothic</b> and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus. While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.|$|E
5|$|The American <b>Gothic</b> House, {{also known}} as the Dibble House, is a house in Eldon, Iowa, {{designed}} in the Carpenter <b>Gothic</b> style with a distinctive upper window. It was the backdrop of the 1930 painting American <b>Gothic</b> by Grant Wood. Generally considered Wood's most famous work and among the most recognized paintings in twentieth century American art, the painting is the model for hundreds of parodies across every creative medium. Grant Wood, who observed the house only twice in his lifetime, made only an initial sketch of the house—he completed American <b>Gothic</b> at his studio in Cedar Rapids.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many English <b>Gothic</b> cathedrals, Bristol's west facade has a rose window {{above the}} central doorway. The details, however, are clearly English, owing {{much to the}} Early English <b>Gothic</b> at Wells Cathedral and the Decorated <b>Gothic</b> at York Minster with a French Rayonnant style.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily <b>Gothic</b> style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} <b>Gothic</b> Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the <b>Gothic</b> style of architecture.|$|E

5|$|Burges scorned his typical French <b>Gothic</b> {{influences}} in his {{design for the}} settle, being influenced instead by English <b>Gothic</b> sources {{as well as the}} Italian Renaissance. It is decorated with a central painted panel, painted by Henry Stacy Marks.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American <b>Gothic</b> House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two <b>Gothic</b> windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American <b>Gothic.</b> The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter <b>Gothic</b> cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to <b>Gothic</b> Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of <b>Gothic</b> Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{the park}} and {{pleasure}} grounds were acquired by the National Trust and it was {{opened to the public}} in 1996. In November 2002, a large-scale restoration project began on the cascade, serpentine lake and <b>Gothic</b> temple in the wilderness area, this is now complete. Extensive planting also took place in 2007. Future plans include re-roofing the grotto and building a replica <b>Gothic</b> temple.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the <b>Gothic</b> War in Italy {{against the}} Ostrogoths {{had been going}} badly for the Byzantine Empire, with the <b>Gothic</b> king Totila having wrested most of the {{peninsula}} back from the Byzantine troops. In 549, Emperor Justinian decided to send a major expeditionary force to Italy with Germanus as its head. Soon, however, {{he changed his mind}} and appointed the patricius Liberius instead, before cancelling the expedition altogether.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{part of the}} Church of England parish {{church of}} St Mary the Virgin is the 12th-century Norman north doorway. The Early English <b>Gothic</b> west tower was built slightly later. The south aisle was added in the 14th century and the chancel was rebuilt in the 15th century with Perpendicular <b>Gothic</b> traceried windows.|$|E
5|$|The first {{buildings}} were {{completed in the}} <b>Gothic</b> style, including the church. The refectory (dining hall) shows an architectural style in transition between earlier Romanesque and contemporary <b>Gothic.</b> A fine High <b>Gothic</b> chapter house was built of best quality hard limestone. The church was rebuilt sometime before 1650 in a late <b>Gothic</b> style with a prominent vaulted ceiling. The cloister was rebuilt around 1617, and is of a simple design with little adornment surrounding a High Renaissance arcade. The final phase of building took place around 1650, with a new doorway for the church, completed in late Renaissance and Plateresque style full of detail. Because of its prosperity and the multiple expansion projects, Santa María de Óvila exhibited examples of every Spanish religious architectural style used from 1200 to 1600. However, even at its height, Óvila remained {{one of the smallest}} Cistercian monasteries in the region of Castile.|$|E

5|$|The north wing was {{included}} in the remodelling work of 1805 and given ogee headed windows in the delicate Strawberry Hill <b>Gothic</b> style, popular at turn of the 19th century; it was a forerunner of the more medieval ecclesiastical <b>Gothic</b> style that was to characterise the architecture of the 19th century, and employed at Ashton Court during the 1885 alterations.|$|E
5|$|The {{style that}} {{developed}} from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, {{is now known as}} <b>Gothic.</b> It was characterised by pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttresses. It was brought to Britain by the Cistercians, whose abbeys retained thick walls, but pierced them with lancet arches with slender pointed arches. This style became characteristic of the early <b>Gothic</b> in Britain and can be seen at Dundrennan Abbey, begun around 1142, which resembles religious foundations in northern England. The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European <b>Gothic</b> mouldings and tracery.|$|E
5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond <b>Gothic</b> style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where <b>Gothic</b> vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where <b>Gothic</b> vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed {{to give the impression}} of a starry sky.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the {{building}} is an aisless chapel in the early Decorated <b>Gothic</b> style of the late 13th century, built of local stone with Doulting Stone dressings. The remains of the 13th century great hall are the north wall and some column bases of an internal arcade, indicating that it was a five bayed aisled hall with crenellations and tall windows in the Decorated <b>Gothic</b> style.|$|E
5|$|Unusual for a 13th-century <b>Gothic</b> cathedral, most of {{the windows}} are of clear glass.|$|E
5|$|Visitors are {{encouraged}} to view the house from the outside and have their photo taken—in fact, the visitors center provides many sizes of similar aprons and jackets worn by the original painting's models. The adjacent American <b>Gothic</b> House Center, completed in 2007, contains exhibits about the painting, artist Grant Wood, and the community around the house. Each June, the city of Eldon holds its <b>Gothic</b> Days festival, {{a celebration of the}} painting and rural life in Eldon in the 1930s. Starting in 2015, tours began in {{the first floor of the}} home. The <b>Gothic</b> House is not handicap accessible.|$|E

5|$|A <b>Gothic</b> {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of <b>Gothic,</b> revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian <b>Gothic</b> design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the <b>Gothic</b> style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century <b>Gothic</b> vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' Episcopal Church is a stone church {{also on the}} National Register of Historic Places. It {{was founded}} in 1854 by John David Ogilby, whose summer estate and family home in Ireland were the namesakes of Briarcliff Manor. The <b>Gothic</b> Revival church, built on Ogilby's summer estate, was {{designed}} by Richard Upjohn and modeled on Saint Andrew's in Bemerton, England. The church, with an 1883 Stick style rectory and 1904 Arts and Crafts-style parish hall, {{is an example of}} the modest English <b>Gothic</b> parish church popular in the region during the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although most <b>Gothic</b> {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents <b>Gothic</b> features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of <b>Gothic</b> rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where <b>Gothic</b> pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the <b>Gothic</b> elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
5|$|Between 1275 and 1310 the undercroft and {{chapter house}} were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter {{house in the}} Geometric style of Decorated <b>Gothic</b> architecture. In about 1310 work {{commenced}} on the Lady Chapel, {{to the design of}} Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated <b>Gothic</b> style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.|$|E
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of the <b>Gothic</b> Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier <b>Gothic</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch and its {{surrounding}} areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of <b>Gothic</b> architecture, {{something that can be}} directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental <b>Gothic</b> stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden <b>Gothic</b> churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, Cyril, continued to work in his father's <b>Gothic</b> style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of St Luke's in the City, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary R A Lawson as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the <b>Gothic</b> style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly <b>Gothic</b> cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English <b>Gothic.</b>|$|E
