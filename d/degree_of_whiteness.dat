25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiteness.</b> Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E
60|$|Not knowing, therefore, what {{number of}} particles, nor what motion of them, is fit to produce any precise <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiteness,</b> we cannot DEMONSTRATE the certain {{equality}} of any two degrees of whiteness; {{because we have}} no certain standard to measure them by, nor means to distinguish every the least real difference, the only help we have being from our senses, which in this point fail us. But where the difference is so great as to produce in the mind clearly distinct ideas, whose differences can be perfectly retained, there these ideas or colours, as we see in different kinds, as blue and red, are as capable of demonstration as ideas of number and extension. What I have here said of whiteness and colours, I think holds true in all secondary qualities and their modes.|$|E
60|$|If it be so, {{that our}} idea of {{infinity}} be {{got from the}} power we observe in ourselves of repeating, without end, our own ideas, it may be demanded,--Why we do not attribute infinity to other ideas, {{as well as those}} of space and duration; since they may be as easily, and as often, repeated in our minds as the other: and yet nobody ever thinks of infinite sweetness or infinite whiteness, though he can repeat the idea of sweet or white, as frequently as those of a yard or a day? To which I answer,--All the ideas that are considered as having parts, and are capable of increase by the addition of an equal or less parts, afford us, by their repetition, the idea of infinity; because, with this endless repetition, there is continued an enlargement of which there CAN be no end. But for other ideas it is not so. For to the largest idea of extension or duration that I at present have, the addition of any the least part makes an increase; but to the perfectest idea I have of the whitest whiteness, if I add another of a less equal whiteness, (and of a whiter than I have, I cannot add the idea,) it makes no increase, and enlarges not my idea at all; and therefore the different ideas of whiteness, &c. are called degrees. For those ideas that consist of part are capable of being augmented by every addition of the least part; but if you take the idea of white, which one parcel of snow yielded yesterday to our sight, and another idea of white from another parcel of snow you see to-day, and put them together in your mind, they embody, as it were, all run into one, and the idea of whiteness is not at all increased and if we add a less <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> to a greater, we are so far from increasing, that we diminish it. Those ideas that consist not of parts cannot be augmented to what proportion men please, or be stretched beyond what they have received by their senses; but space, duration, and number, being capable of increase by repetition, leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more; nor can we conceive anywhere a stop to a further addition or progression: and so those ideas ALONE lead our minds towards the thought of infinity.|$|E

40|$|Colposcopy is {{a primary}} {{diagnostic}} method used to detect cancer and precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. During the examination, the metaplastic and abnormal tissues exhibit different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> (acetowhitening effect) after applying a 3 %- 5 % acetic acid solution. Colposcopists evaluate the color and density of the acetowhite tissue to assess the severity of lesions {{for the purpose of}} diagnosis, telemedicine, and annotation. However, the color and illumination of the colposcopic images vary with the light sources, the instruments and camera settings, as well as the clinical environments. This makes assessment of the color information very challenging even for an expert. In terms of developing a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for colposcopy, these variations affect the performance of the feature extraction algorithm for the acetowhite color. Non-uniform illumination from the light source is also an obstacle for detecting acetowhite regions, lesion margins and anatomic features. Therefore, in digital colposcopy, it is critical to map the color appearance of the images taken with different colposcopes into one standard color space with normalized illumination. This paper presents a novel image calibration technique for colposcopic images. First, a specially designed calibration unit is mounted on the colposcope to acquire daily calibration data prior to performing patient examinations. The calibration routine is fast, automated, accurate and reliable. We then use our illumination correction algorithm and a color calibration algorithm to calibrate the patient data. In this paper we describe these techniques and demonstrate their applications in clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|Larkin, EdwardThis {{dissertation}} {{builds on}} recent innovations in empires studies {{to argue that}} the visual and textual representation of Native Americans in print culture worked in dialogue to shape imperial identities among the diverse peoples of North America. I suggest that rather than forming through the commonly accepted colonizer/colonized model that theorizes the figure of the Indian as pure other, imperial identities in North America emerged through image-text patterns of triangulation that located Native Americans between empires. By placing icons and illustrations of Indians in conversation with the textual representations that circulated alongside them in transatlantic books and broadsides, the project shows that the representation of Native Americans in print culture not only shaped ideas of race that justify imperialism against indigenous peoples, but ideologies of racialized difference between imperial peoples. This approach further demonstrates that marginalized peoples such as Native Americans and African-Americans employed triangularity not only to resist imperialism, but sometimes to position themselves within North American imperial networks. “Printing Indians” thus suggests that print cultures shape imperial identities through vectors of racialized difference that simultaneously justify conquest of indigenous peoples and warfare between empires in the contest to become North America’s ultimate empire. By studying this transatlantic system of signification as it evolved between King Philip’s War (1676) and the conclusion of the U. S. Civil War (1864), each chapter examines how Anglo-Americans, Native Americans, and Africans used image and text to animate hierarchies among racialized <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> and redness.

My findings from twelve months of residential ethnographic research suggest that due to class-inflected discourses about clothing, hair, language, labour, and respectable and desirable ways of living, English village residents view Eastern European migrant workers as ‘not quite white’ enough to be accepted into rural village life. Based on an analysis of the discourses through which English villagers construct binaries of self/other and insider/outsider, I conclude that Eastern European migrants are subject to subtle and class-based processes of racialisation...|$|R

40|$|Increased US {{export of}} cotton and global {{competition}} necessitates that plant breeders {{continue to improve}} fiber properties of upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.). Cotton cultivars having whiter fibers and more mature fibers are desirable due to decreased processing costs. TAM B 182 - 33 ELS (Extra Long Staple) germplasm line of upland cotton, and Tamcot CAMD-E, a short staple obsolete cultivar were crossed with 36 cultivars representing unique germplasm pools from China (12 cultivars), west and central Africa (7 cultivars), south Africa (10 cultivars), and the United States (7 cultivars) that represent distinct germplasm pools. Parents and F 1 s were grown in College Station, TX, in a Line x Tester design during the summers of 2010 and 2011. Seedcotton was harvested by hand (to avoid the presence of thrash particles in the lint that could bias the color measurements), deburred and allowed to dry in limited light. Cotton samples were ginned on a laboratory saw gin, separated into 2. 00 gram subsamples, and color measurements were taken using a Konica-Minolta CR- 310 reflectance colorimeter. Absolute color measurements were obtained in two color systems (tristimulus XYZ and CIE L*a*b*). At the Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute (FBRI) in Lubbock, TX, 50. 0 mg samples of the 38 parents and F 1 s {{were used to determine}} maturity ratio (MR), ribbon width (RbWth) and micronaire (Mic) on a Cottonscope.

Building upon previous research, this study further defines the details of the scleral color display and contributes to the more general issue of facial and body symmetry, predictors of phenotypic condition and genotypic quality that are of interest to evolutionary theorists. Individuals with binocular and monocular redness were rated as sadder, less healthy, and less attractive than those with untinted control sclerae, with ratings corresponding to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> redness or <b>whiteness.</b> Bilaterally symmetrical (binocular) scleral redness or whiteness provided anchorage points for ratings, with ratings for bilaterally asymmetrical (monocular) redness or whiteness falling between them; there was no unique effect of asymmetry...|$|R
