5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI {{replaced}} the 3rd Battalion in April as CANBAT 1. The {{commander of the}} 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Calvin, instructed his troops to approach their tasks <b>differently</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Battalion had. Calvin (unlike his predecessor) {{did not want the}} RSK forces or the HV to be aware of CANBAT 1 operations, ordering the battalion to observe radio silence. According to Canadian journalist Carol Off, Calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary. The situation in Sector West deteriorated when Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. A major contribution to the deterioration was Shabshough's minimal involvement with local authorities, in contrast to Zabala's cooperative approach.|$|E
5|$|Academic Decathlon was {{originally}} organized <b>differently</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, physical science, social science, current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading. Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It {{was not until}} 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place {{of one of the}} other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's Science, Language and Literature, Music, Social Science, Art, and Economics curriculum.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a {{pterosaur}} neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth {{embedded in}} it {{confirmed that the}} latter were not exclusively piscivorous. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts indicated that the biomechanics of Baryonyx were most {{similar to those of}} the gharial and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of Baryonyx and Spinosaurus similar in their resistance to bending and torsion. Baryonyx was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with Spinosaurus and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that Baryonyx performed <b>differently</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.|$|E

5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any <b>differently</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of the leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

A laserdisc version was planned by Image Entertainment yet never distributed. ADV Films re-released the English version, as Once Upon a Time, on DVD on March 23, 2004. The uncut Japanese version has never been officially released in this region.|$|E

Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot at him from the banks.

500|$|Howarth said writers {{go with a}} {{recognizable}} archetype when creating soap opera characters. [...] Writer Jennifer Hayward felt the same, stating that like 19th century melodrama and serials, soap operas draw on powerful archetypes. Writer Dianne L. Brooks states that the storyline conforms {{to many of the}} same conventions of how rape has been presented in soap operas. [...] According to Hayward, the OLTL writers [...] "had a terrific time camping up Todd as the embodiment of evil". She said that the writers who created Todd's first major storyline, the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke and its aftermath, treated rape like most soap operas had done in the past, by using archetypes such as the fight between good and evil and the contrast between the weak and strong. Author Gerry Waggett said, [...] "The close-ups of the rapists' faces during the assault, distorted to capture Marty's scared and drunken perspective, rank among the show's most graphic images." [...] An attempt was made to dramatize the rape and present it <b>differently</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> typical voyeuristic perspective, and the scenes were designed to disturb the audience. [...] Waggett added: [...] "Marty's subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated the show" [...] throughout the summer of 1993.|$|E
