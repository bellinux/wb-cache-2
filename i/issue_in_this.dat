25|$|PepsiCo's {{usage of}} water {{was the subject}} of {{controversy}} in India in the early and mid-2000s, {{in part because of the}} company's alleged impact on water usage in a country where water shortages are a perennial <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> setting, PepsiCo was perceived by India-based environmental organizations as a company that diverted water to manufacture a discretionary product, making it a target for critics at the time.|$|E
25|$|Some {{problems}} {{that are expected to}} be an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E

Barbour's actions included 19 people convicted of murder. Pardons by governors are not uncommon; the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case {{is the number of}} pardons compared to former governors. Previous Governor Ronnie Musgrove, issued only one pardon, for a man convicted of marijuana possession; Governor Kirk Fordice, who preceded Musgrove, issued only two full pardons for convicted murderers.|$|E
25|$|In {{physical}} cosmology, fractal cosmology {{is a set}} {{of minority}} cosmological theories which state that the distribution of matter in the Universe, or the structure of the universe itself, is a fractal across a wide range of scales (see also: multifractal system). More generally, it relates to the usage or appearance of fractals {{in the study of the}} universe and matter. A central <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field is the fractal dimension of the universe or of matter distribution within it, when measured at very large or very small scales.|$|E

At high elevations in Anderson Valley and nearby Mendocino Ridges beyond the fog's reach, these warmer pockets of lands will usually be planted with more warm climate varieties like Zinfandel.

25|$|Disputes over slavery {{placed the}} church in {{difficulty}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant to take a stand. The Wesleyan Methodist Connexion (later became The Wesleyan Church) and the Free Methodist Churches were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the Underground Railroad, which helped to free the slaves. Finally, in a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> merger also joined the Methodist Protestant Church. Some southerners, conservative in theology, and strongly segregationist, opposed the merger, and formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of Khan Sevar (r.738–753) the ruling Dulo clan died out and the Khanate fell into a long {{political}} crisis during which the young country {{was on the verge}} of destruction. In just fifteen years seven Khans reigned, and all of them were murdered. The only surviving sources of this period are Byzantine and present only the Byzantine point of view of the ensuing political turmoil in Bulgaria. They describe two factions struggling for powerone that sought peaceful relations with the Empire, which was dominant until 755, and one that favoured war. These sources present the relations with the Byzantine Empire as the main <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> internal struggle and do not mention the other reasons, which could have been more important for the Bulgarian elite. It is likely that the relationship between the politically dominant Bulgars and the more numerous Slavs was the main issue behind the struggle but there is no evidence about the aims of the rival factions. Zlatarski speculates that the old Bulgar military aristocracy was leaning towards war while other Bulgars supported by the majority of the Slavs were inclined for peace with Byzantium.|$|E

[...] On this question Moskowitz agreed with NOAA. By going from ship to ship to buy, store and transport the fins, the KD II and its crew [...] "directly aided and assisted the foreign vessels in an expressly enumerated fishing activity under the statute." ...|$|E

Fellows was not cited. [...] In 1899, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a $1,967,056 judgment of the Court of Claims (pursuant to an enabling statute) against the federal government based on the 1838 treaty.

500|$|... ven if I {{agreed with}} the {{majority}} that the removal of restraints on alienation should trigger the application of state limitations periods, the 1959 Act lifted only statutory restrictions on the alienation of Catawba land, and the requirement that the Federal Government approve any transfer of the property at <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case did not, and does not, stem solely from any federal statute. The land {{set aside for the}} Catawbas in 1760 and 1763 was within the Tribe's aboriginal territory, and their claim to the land thus derives from original title {{as well as from the}} 18th-century treaties.

[...] "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." [...] According to Stevens, [...] "he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program".

500|$|In {{a similar}} case, Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co., a {{coalition}} of farmers filed suit to challenge twenty-three of Monsanto's patents for glyphosate-resistant crops. The plaintiffs argued that if their crops became [...] "contaminated by transgenic seed, which {{may very well be}} inevitable given the proliferation of transgenic seed today, they could quite perversely also be accused of patent infringement". The plaintiffs sued to declare Monsanto's patents invalid and asked Monsanto to [...] "expressly waive any claim for patent infringement [...] may ever have" [...] against the farmers and to [...] "memorialize that waiver by providing a written covenant not to sue". However, the case was dismissed for lack of a controversy. The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk. Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop. Monsanto's patent for the soybeans at <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case expired in 2014, prior to which Monsanto announced that it will no longer enforce the licenses associated with the soybeans.|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{appeared}} at Kick Butts Day, a protest {{organized by the}} Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015.

[...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country anymore and that's completely not true.

[...] Other new writers who appeared in the magazine include M. John Harrison and Robert Holdstock, both of whom appeared in the November 1968 issue. [...] The December 1968 issue included Samuel R.
