2500|$|In {{the second}} week of play, Vanderbilt {{traveled}} to Ann Arbor for a rematch of last year's scoreless tie with the Michigan Wolverines. There was much optimism among the Vanderbilt faithful, <b>for</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> its team had many injuries when it tied Michigan; and this year the squad was healthy. Michigan's A. J. Sturzenegger had scouted Vanderbilt shortly before the game, and found the Commodores to have good reason for thinking they could win. He was not alone in this view, the Commodores were [...] "regarded as having fully as strong an aggregation as last year." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{take the}} death duties. One would suppose from what one hears in London {{and from the}} outcry that is raised, that {{the whole of the}} death duties were {{collected}} from the peers and from the county families. Again I say, look at the facts. The Inland Revenue report <b>for</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> shows that £313,000,000 of property passing on death became subject to death duties, and of that sum £228,000,000 was personalty and not real estate, leaving only £85,000,000 real estate, and of that £85,000,000 only £22,000,000 was agricultural land. These death duties are represented as being levied entirely upon a small class of landed gentry and nobility, but, as a matter of fact, there is collected from that class in respect of agricultural land only seven per cent. of the whole amount of money which the Exchequer derives from death duties.[19] ...|$|E

In the second number, as I open it at hazard, Captain Roberts, master of the ship [...] "Empire," [...] from Shields to London, reports how on the 14th ult. (the 14th December, 1859), he, [...] "being off Whitby, discovered the ship to be on fire between the main hold and boilers: got the hose from the engine laid on, and succeeded in subduing the fire; but only apparently; for at seven the next morning, the 'Dudgeon' bearing S.S.E. seven miles' distance, the fire again broke out, causing the ship to be enveloped in flames on both sides of midships: got the hose again into play and all hands to work with buckets to combat with the fire. Did not succeed in stopping it till four P. M., to effect which, were obliged to cut away the deck and top sides, and throw overboard part of the cargo. The vessel was very much damaged and leaky: determined to make for the Humber. Ship was run on shore, on the mud, near Grimsby harbor, with five feet of water in her hold. The donkey-engine broke down. The water increased so fast as to put out the furnace fires and render the ship almost unmanageable. On the tide flowing, a tug towed the ship off the mud, and got her into Grimsby to repair." ...|$|E

6000|$|The young gentleman {{disappeared}} {{upon his}} errand: the coach was called and came. Mrs. Walker slipped {{into it with}} her basket, and the page went downstairs to his companions in the kitchen, and said, [...] "It's a-comin'! master's in quod, and missus has gone out to pawn the plate." [...] When the cook went out that day, she somehow had by mistake placed in her basket a dozen of table-knives and a plated egg-stand. When the lady's-maid took {{a walk in the}} course of the afternoon, she found she had occasion for eight cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, (marked with her mistress's cipher), half-a-dozen pair of shoes, gloves, long and short, some silk stockings, and a gold-headed scent-bottle. [...] "Both the new cashmeres is gone," [...] said she, [...] "and there's nothing left in Mrs. Walker's trinket-box but a paper of pins and an old coral bracelet." [...] As for the page, he rushed incontinently to his master's dressing-room and examined every one of the pockets of his clothes; made a parcel of some of them, and opened all the drawers which Walker had not locked before his departure. He only found three-halfpence and a bill stamp, and about forty-five tradesmen's accounts, neatly labelled and tied up with red tape. These three worthies, a groom who was a great admirer of Trimmer the lady's-maid, and a policeman a friend of the cook's, sat down to a comfortable dinner at the usual hour, and it was agreed among them all that Walker's ruin was certain. The cook made the policeman a present of a china punch-bowl which Mrs. Walker had given her; and the lady's-maid gave her friend the [...] "Book of Beauty" [...] <b>for</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> and the third volume of Byron's poems from the drawing-room table.|$|E
