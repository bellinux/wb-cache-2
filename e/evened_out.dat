5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} {{game of the}} 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for {{throwing}} six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished {{the game with a}} 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7wins, 10losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158strikeouts in just a bit over 157innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, {{it was clear that he}} was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11innings and matched a career high of 15strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69strikeouts in 53innings pitched during the stretch.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{land has}} been altered {{substantially}} by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.

25|$|Georgescu engaged {{himself in}} {{politics}} and joined the pro-monarchy National Peasants' Party. The country's economy was still underdeveloped and had a large agrarian base, where {{the mass of the}} peasantry lived in backwardness and poverty. Substantial land reforms were called for if the most appalling inequalities between the rural and the urban parts of the population were to be <b>evened</b> <b>out.</b> Georgescu put a persuasive effort into this work and was soon elevated to the higher ranks of the party, becoming member of the party's National Council.|$|E
25|$|The mid-1960s {{ushered in}} {{a new type of}} {{industrial}} development as the economy opened itself to international competition in some industries and developed heavy and chemical manufactures. Whereas textiles and light manufactures maintained their profitability internationally, other products, such as automobiles, electronics, ships, and machine tools assumed new importance. The value added to manufacturing and mining grew at the rate of 17% per year between 1965 and 1970. Growth rates moderated to about 8% and <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> between the industrial and service sectors between 1970 and 1973, as retail trade, finance, real estate, information technology, and other service industries streamlined their operations.|$|E
25|$|Northamptonshire won {{the match}} at The County Ground, Northampton {{after making a}} total of 140 in the first innings.

Graeme Welch chipped in by conceding 21 runs in ten overs and {{claiming}} three scalps. Steve Stubbings and Michael di Venuto then shared an opening partnership of 81, but two wickets from Johann Louw <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> the game somewhat, and Monty Panesar wrapped up Derbyshire's innings with three wickets on the second day, as Derbyshire were bowled out for 219.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was <b>evened</b> <b>out.</b> After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match of}} the night {{featured}} CMLL's women's wrestling division as eight ladies competed for the La Copa 81 Aniversario ("81st Anniversary Cup") trophy in an elimination match. Dalys la Caribeña, {{one of the eight}} participants, came to the ring dressed like a winged Greek character, complete with a Greek soldier's helmet, leather strap outfit and both her face and body painted in black and red colors. She removed the attached wings and the metal helmet before the match. The teams were divided between the four tecnicas (Marcela, Estrellita, Princesa Sigehit and Goya Kong) facing off against the ruda team (La Amapola, Tiffany, Dalys and Zeuxis). After several minutes of wrestling, with all participants taking turns in the ring Tiffany was the first wrestler eliminated when Princesa Sugehit pinned her. Moments later the sides were <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> when La Amapola pinned the Mexican National Women's Champion Estrellita to eliminate her. From that point each elimination came quickly after each other, generally alternating between the two sides with Dalys, then Princesa Sugeith, then Goya Kong and finally La Amapola being eliminated leaving only Zeuxis and Marcela, the CMLL Women's World Champion. In the end Zeuxis completed the upset by defeating Marcel after also being instrumental in eliminating Princesa Sugeith and Goya Kong, winning the match. After the match Zeuxis posed with a trophy while celebrating her victory.|$|E
500|$|In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers {{beat the}} Chicago Bulls and the Warriors {{to set up}} yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was {{considered}} a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to counter Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich. In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107–101, but L.A. <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength {{the rest of the}} series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35points, but Boston won by threepoints. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: [...] "We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth. But I take nothing from them… They're all that way on the Celtics, and you can't teach it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{and above}} {{a great deal}} of false nonsynchronism [...] there is this one in particular: Nature, and more than that, the ghost of history comes very easily to the desperate peasant, to the {{bankrupt}} petty bourgeois; the depression which releases the ghost takes place in a country with a particularly large amount of pre-capitalist material. It is important to ask whether Germany is not more undeveloped, even more vulcanic than, for instance, France, in terms of its power.

The idea of a [...] "Curse of the Cowboy" [...] did not take hold, however, due to the great affection Autry engendered as a public figure, and the idea would diminish with the sale of the team and its later postseason success.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect of}} damming was the {{creation}} of Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills. [...] These lakes had a multitude of impacts on the river beyond sediment retention. [...] Because the water stayed in the lake for so long, it warmed up to approximately 16°C. [...] Normal water temperatures are around 0°C. [...] These higher temperatures are unnatural for spawning fish, which prefer colder ocean temperature waters. [...] This increase in temperature also increases parasite populations. [...] Disease was known to wipe out two thirds of a spawning population, before it had a chance to spawn. [...] The lakes also acted as buffers for high and low flow conditions. [...] While the dams were not actively used for flood control, the reservoirs behind them altered the natural flow patterns of the river. [...] The normal seasonal high and low flow were <b>evened</b> <b>out</b> by the reservoirs and dams so that flow was relatively constant throughout the year. [...] Natural flow patterns are known to promote the health of native species and to help eliminate non native species after dam removal.|$|E
