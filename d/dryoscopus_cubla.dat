5000|$|The {{black-backed puffback}} (<b>Dryoscopus</b> <b>cubla)</b> is {{a species of}} {{passerine}} bird in the Malaconotidae family. They are common to fairly common sedentary bushshrikes in various wooded habitats in Africa south of the equator. They restlessly move about singly, in pairs or family groups, and generally frequent tree canopies. Like others of its genus, the males puff out the loose rump and lower back feathers in display, to assume a remarkable ball-like appearance. They draw attention to themselves by their varied repertoire of whistling, clicking and rasping sounds. Their specific name cubla, originated with Francois Levaillant, who derived it from a native southern African name, where the [...] "c" [...] is an onomatopoeic click sound. None of the other five puffback species occur in southern Africa.|$|E
40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks {{were studied}} at Kichwa Tembo Camp {{on the edge}} the Masia Mara National Reserve in Kenya between July and September 2004. Observations were made on 29 mixed-species flocks, in which 24 species participated. African Paradise Flycatcher Terpsiphone viridis, Black-backed Puffback <b>Dryoscopus</b> <b>cubla,</b> Grey-backed Cameroptera Camaroptera brachyura, Collard Sunbird Hedydipna collaris and Cabanis’s Greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi were the most common participants in mixed-species flocks, as well as among the most frequently encountered bird species overall. The Black-backed Puffback was identified as the nuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency {{with which they were}} followed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in this diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock specialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were opportunistic attendant species, including the African Pygmy Kingfisher Ispidina picta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The study {{centred on}} the {{investigation}} of phylogeographic structure within three forest associated bird species and two small mammal species, {{as well as two}} woodland associated bird species distributed across the Malawi Rift of Africa. The key objective was to investigate the extent to which geographically structured lineages exist within several bird (Stripe-cheeked Greenbul Andropadus milanjensis, Malawi Batis Batis dimorpha, Bar-throated Apalis Apalis thoracica, Southern Puffback <b>Dryoscopus</b> <b>cubla</b> and White-browed Robin- chat Cossypha heuglini) and small mammal species (Delectable Soft-furred Mouse Praomys delectorum and Dark-coloured Brush-furred Rat Lophuromys aquilus) distributed across the Malawi Rift. Analyses of a combination of mtDNA (1041 bp ND 2 in birds, and 1130 - 1143 bp Cytochrome-b and 461 - 466 bp control region in mammals) and nDNA (463 - 481 bp CHDZ, 569 - 572 MUSK and 594 bp TGFb 2 in birds, and Beta-Fibrinogen intron- 7 in small mammals) revealed significant population structure in each of the five forest associated species studied. In contrast, woodland associated birds exhibited reduced spatial genetic structure across the Malawi Rift. Collectively the result suggest that phylogeographic breaks for forest associated species occur in the southern highlands separating Mount Namuli in Mozambique and Mount Mulanje as well as between Mount Mulanje and Mount Zomba in Malawi; in the central highlands that split Malawi into two halves, and within the northern highlands separating the Misuku Hills and Nyika Plateau. The Misuku Hills are also separated from the Udzungwa Mountains of the Eastern Arc and volcanic Mount Rungwe in Tanzania. Genetic differences exhibited by the taxa investigated across the phylogeographic breaks and degree of lineage turnover revealed in the small mammals support observations by Vrba (1985) based on fossil mammal assemblages that Malawi may be geographically key to understanding faunal turnover between southern and east African animal taxa. The detected phylogeographic breaks primarily occur in forest reserves that are not adequately protected with the exception of Nyika National Park. Illegal logging and uncontrolled fires are threatening the montane ‘sky islands’ population, thus compromising the conservation of the fauna and important evolutionary distinct units...|$|E
