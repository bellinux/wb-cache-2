5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of <b>even</b> degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an <b>even</b> order, and an isolated vertex has an <b>even</b> degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of <b>even</b> degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an <b>even</b> number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the <b>even</b> number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

40|$|Low {{glycaemic}} index (GI) foods consumed at breakfast can enhance memory {{in comparison to}} high-GI foods; however, the impact of <b>evening</b> meal GI manipulations on cognition the following morning remains unexplored. Fourteen healthy males consumed a high-GI <b>evening</b> meal or a low-GI <b>evening</b> meal in a counterbalanced order on two separate evenings. Memory and attention were assessed before and after a high-GI breakfast the following morning. The high-GI <b>evening</b> meal elicited significantly higher <b>evening</b> glycaemic responses than the low-GI <b>evening</b> meal. Verbal recall was better the morning following the high-GI <b>evening</b> meal compared to after the low-GI <b>evening</b> meal. In summary, the GI of the <b>evening</b> meal was associated with memory performance the next day, suggesting a second meal cognitive effect. The present findings imply that an overnight fast may {{not be sufficient to}} control for previous nutritional consumption...|$|R

5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is <b>even</b> can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with thinking of it as <b>even,</b> enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or <b>even.</b> The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other <b>even</b> numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, <b>even</b> slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that <b>even</b> very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because <b>even</b> a small {{degree of protection}} reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of <b>even</b> numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences.

Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an <b>even</b> number, 1 has an <b>even</b> number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E
