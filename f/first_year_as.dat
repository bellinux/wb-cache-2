5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E

5|$|Leeds City had {{finished}} 19th in the Second Division {{in the season}} preceding Chapman's arrival, and were facing re-election. Chapman played an essential part in lobbying for the side's readmission and Leeds City were duly re-elected. That done, Chapman signed new talent such as Jimmy Speirs from Bradford City and despite some erratic performances – losing 6–0 in between two 5–1 wins, for example – City finished sixth in 1912–13, Chapman's first season. Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8,500 to 13,000 in his <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> <b>as</b> Chapman's attacking side scored 70goals, the second-highest total in the entire division.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the University, Arafat studied civil engineering and {{served as president of}} the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) from 1952 to 1956. During his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> president of the union, the University was renamed Cairo University after a coup was carried out by the Free Officers Movement overthrowing King Farouk I. By that time, Arafat had graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and was called to duty to fight with Egyptian forces during the Suez Crisis; however, he never actually fought. Later that year, at a conference in Prague, he donned a solid white keffiyeh–different from the fishnet-patterned one he adopted later in Kuwait, which was to become his emblem.|$|E
5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts for managers and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In {{an effort to make}} government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> <b>as</b> well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} event, Packer wanted {{to expand the}} race to take in more states. The 1990 race started on May 4 in Wilmington in Delaware, a state which Trump {{considered}} important for his three casinos in Atlantic City, and also visited Baltimore, after Trump agreed to local racecourse owner Joe De Francis's condition that he moor his yacht the Trump Princess in Baltimore Harbor during the race. It finished in Boston on May 13. Entrants in 1990 included 1989 winner Dag Otto Lauritzen, Greg LeMond, who was coming back from a virus and food poisoning, Steve Bauer, who had finished second in Paris-Roubaix that year, Andrew Hampsten, Davis Phinney, Ekimov, in his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>as</b> a professional, and East German rider Olaf Ludwig. The race was won by Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá of the PDM-Concorde team.|$|E
