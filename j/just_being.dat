5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of <b>just</b> <b>being</b> alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E

5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point.

5|$|Four-time world {{champion}} Vettel however {{was unable to}} overtake the Williams of Valtteri Bottas for fourth. The other Williams of Felipe Massa had applied the undercut well {{in the early part}} of the race to recover from his pit lane-start to eighth position, but when his tyres started to degrade he was passed by both Sergio Pérez and Daniil Kvyat and finished tenth, taking one point. The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, <b>just</b> <b>being</b> able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis, {{the name}} for the massive body of law promulgated by Emperor Justinian from the 530s CE and onwards, {{consists}} of two historical collections of laws and their interpretation (the Digest, opinions of the pre-eminent lawyers from the past, and the Codex Justinianus, a collection of edicts and rescripts by earlier emperors), along with Jusinian's prefatory introduction text for students of Law, Institutes, plus the Novels, Justinian's own, later edicts. That the earlier collections {{were meant to be}} sources for the actual, current practice of law, rather than <b>just</b> <b>being</b> of historical interest, can be seen, for example, from the inclusion, and modification of Modestinus' famous description of poena cullei (Digest 48.9.9), in Justinian's own law text in Institutes 4.18.6.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney <b>just</b> <b>being</b> an employee, as the writers could not imagine Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff are}} {{preparing}} to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers {{that he will be}} sitting in the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of <b>just</b> <b>being</b> an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E
5|$|When {{the ship}} reached Falmouth, Cornwall, on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already a}} celebrity in {{scientific}} circles as in December 1835 Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed {{to take on the}} botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens <b>just</b> <b>being</b> left in storage.|$|E

5|$|After hearing Sunny on the radio, Robin Hester {{turns up}} in Ramsay Street {{to try to}} get close to her. Sunny {{believes}} he is <b>just</b> <b>being</b> friendly. Robin climbs through Sunny's bedroom window and takes a photo of her. He locks Zeke in Pirate Net's storeroom, so he can spend some time with Sunny alone. Sunny and Robin go to Pirate Net to see if Zeke is there and Robin pretends to find the storeroom key and unlocks the door. Zeke tells Sunny that Robin locked him in the storeroom, but she refuses to believe him. Zeke violently attacks Robin in front of Sunny, scaring her. Zeke apologises and Sunny eventually realises that Zeke had been right about Robin. Sunny meets Robin at Charlie's and tells him that she and Zeke have broken up. Robin confesses to locking Zeke in the storeroom and tries to kiss Sunny, but Zeke appears and tells Robin to stay away them.|$|E

Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper's could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song {{near the end of the}} album.|$|E
