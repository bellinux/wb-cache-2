5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness and love of sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction to parties. Despite {{the fact that the}} Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of <b>human</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various <b>human</b> <b>societies.</b> In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|In human culture, domesticated mammals {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and gathering, and leading to a major {{restructuring}} of <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> with the first civilizations. They provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of mammals is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence of Marx is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery {{as a mode of}} production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of <b>human</b> <b>societies,</b> including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only {{the most remarkable}} discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E
40|$|A {{definite}} {{shift is}} underway from an environmental protection regulatory stance to {{a view of}} natural systems as essential components of <b>human</b> <b>society's</b> life support system. In addition, before the agricultural and industrial revolutions, arguably, <b>human</b> <b>society's</b> entire life support system was ecological. With increased human population size and the redistribution of people to urban areas, <b>human</b> <b>society</b> became dependent on a technological life support system for energy, shelter, distribution of food and other resources, and disposal of wastes (to mention a few illustrative examples). The ecological component of the life support system maintained atmospheric gas balance, transformed waste, and provided {{a number of other}} services of value to <b>human</b> <b>society</b> (1,).

5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many <b>human</b> <b>societies,</b> the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
40|$|Drastic {{reductions}} in Earth's biodiversity, old growth forests, top soil, {{clean water and}} air, and truly wild areas are occurring during a period when discussions of sustainable growth and sustainable production are becoming common. Using such terms as sustainable growth and sustainable production rather than the more accurate sustainable use of the planet leaves the impression that, {{with a little more}} skill, society can continue its present practices indefinitely. A number of explanations are possible for this desire to maintain two conflicting beliefs (i. e., severe environmental destruction occurs but society can continue its basic practices indefinitely) : 1) the idea that a technological solution can be found for every problem; 2) an addiction to present behavioral norms, which is so strong that the consequences of continuing such behavior are irrelevant; and 3) the concept that, while <b>human</b> <b>society</b> can alter natural systems to suit its own needs, natural systems are incapable of altering <b>human</b> <b>society.</b> This last issue is the focus of this discussion: if <b>human</b> <b>society</b> eliminates all species on the planet that are incapable of tolerating <b>human</b> <b>society's</b> present practices, the only species remaining will be those that <b>human</b> <b>society</b> is unable to control successfully or eliminate; these species are called pests. Another hypothesis could be stated: a world of pests that <b>human</b> <b>society</b> cannot control effectively will inevitably reshape <b>human</b> <b>society</b> through disease and famine, technological breakdown, and interference with domesticated and wild species upon which the integrity of human societal structure depends...|$|R

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>society</b> {{has been}} {{accustomed}} to thinking of natural systems as entities requiring protection or exploitation. There has been much hyberbole in the presentation of both views. Although people have spoken {{of the death of}} nature, it is unlikely that humanity could entirely eliminate all non-domesticated species. Each time <b>human</b> <b>society</b> does something, natural systems adjust, not aIways in ways intended. And, this, in turn, requires <b>human</b> <b>society</b> to adjust. This mutual modification is analogous lo coevolution seen in pairs of species. Coevolution between one species and another is often accomplished through harsh penalties for a component that does not respond rapidly to changes in the other component. A coevolution of <b>human</b> <b>society</b> and natural systems will be less unpleasant to humans if rapid information systems are developed to alert society lo needed changes, coupled with a sufficiently high environmental literary to make the changes before the selective pressures of natural systems are too harsh. Instead of polarizing views of <b>human</b> <b>society's</b> relationship with natural systems, to be degree possible, this relationship should be viewed as one system coevolving with another.

5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of <b>human</b> <b>societies,</b> including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into <b>human</b> <b>societies</b> through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E
