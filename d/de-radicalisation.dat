[...] "One does find early expressions of such perspectives in (William) Morris and the Socialist Party of Great Britain (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the bureaucratisation and <b>de-radicalisation</b> of international socialism". Morris established the Socialist League in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and Eleanor Marx. As the leading figure in the organization Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners, in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League. The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the change, with {{a majority of the}} 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring that [...] "This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it." [...] Morris played peacemaker but sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx and her partner Edward Aveling to form the separate Bloomsbury Socialist Society.|$|E
40|$|<b>De-radicalisation</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} prevalent in the UK’s counter-terrorism policy as a strategy for tackling the threat of religiously inspired violence/extremism. Recently, British citizens fighting in Middle Eastern conflicts have rekindled the preoccupation of policymakers with the radicalisation of British Muslims. In fact the work of PREVENT post 2011 has primarily been recalibrated towards a greater focus on <b>de-radicalisation</b> interventions, which is delivered by the police through the Channel programme. Channel is perceived by policy-makers {{to be a more}} streamlined and effective way of dealing with radicalised/extremist individuals than the wide remit of PREVENT initiatives between 2006 and 2010. Indeed since becoming placed on a statutory footing in 2015, PREVENT requires public institutions, like schools and universities, to identify ‘vulnerable’ individuals’ at risk of radicalisation. And yet despite the greater attention on <b>de-radicalisation,</b> very little continues to be known about what makes violent individuals leave terrorism behind. <b>De-radicalisation</b> in PREVENT is characterised by the absence of credible research, little or no empirical evidence for policy development, confusion surrounding its conceptual framework, and conflicting policy logics. The following thesis is based on a case-study examination of <b>de-radicalisation</b> with 27 PREVENT practitioners. Through qualitative semi-structured interviews, my investigation seeks to address the problems that arise from the concept and practice of <b>de-radicalisation</b> in PREVENT by ascertaining (a) an ontological understanding of <b>de-radicalisation</b> and (b) the practice of <b>de-radicalisation.</b> The findings of the fieldwork data revealed the existence of multiple conceptions of <b>de-radicalisation</b> and a number of conceptual features unique to the UK context. Despite yielding a more fruitful conceptual and empirical understanding of <b>de-radicalisation,</b> the data in itself nevertheless could not fully explicate the relationship between several critical themes comprehensively within an analytically generative framework. With the inductive method falling short, I draw on Michel Foucault’s concept of the ‘technologies of the self’. Comprising of discursive, disciplinary, and confessional technologies, it is argued that the technologies of the self allows us to reframe the concept beyond the narrow confines of counter-terrorism policy and place it within wider governmental relations. Situated within neo-liberal governmentality, the technologies of the self encourage individuals to work on themselves and regulate their behaviour through a wide range of discursive, practical, and technical interventions. Seen in this way, <b>de-radicalisation</b> is therefore less about the mitigation of violence and more about the making of a particular political and ethical subjectivity. Ultimately, the technology of the self eschews the conceptual problems inherent in the PREVENT conception of <b>de-radicalisation,</b> the limitations evident in the literature, whilst amplifying the salient findings of my fieldwork data. It provides a more robust concept and theory that successfully captures and explains <b>de-radicalisation</b> in the UK context. This thesis thus makes an original contribution to knowledge by (1) being the first study to gather primary data on <b>de-radicalisation</b> in the UK; (2) offering an alternative concept of de-radicalisation; and (3) contributing to theories on the governmentality of radicalisation policies, focusing on the micro-politics of identity in neoliberal governance...|$|E
40|$|The Nigerian Counter Terrorism Strategy {{recognised}} {{that force}} alone {{was not enough}} to combat violent extremist elements in Nigeria and that a multi-faceted approach was required to counter the threat of violent extremism. The Office of the National Security Advisor (ONSA) was tasked with developing an ambitious countering violent extremism (CVE) programme consisting of three elements: community-based counter radicalisation; strategic communications; and <b>de-radicalisation.</b> The <b>de-radicalisation</b> element of the CVE programme included establishing a prison based <b>de-radicalisation</b> programme for sentenced and pre-trial prisoners. The challenge facing ONSA and the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS) in setting up the <b>de-radicalisation</b> programme was considerable. Prison conditions were basic; there were no existing offending behaviour programmes on which to build; risk assessment was rudimentary and focussed on escape risk; awareness among staff at all levels of <b>de-radicalisation</b> programmes, their content and how they should be managed, was minimal; specialist staff were in short supply and had no training in running interventions; and resources, both physical and financial, were limited. This paper sets out how ONSA and NPS went about establishing the <b>de-radicalisation</b> programme and describes key elements of that programme, including: creating a supportive operating environment; risk and needs assessment; types of intervention; and programme management and staffing. It highlights the challenges and lessons that can be drawn from the operation of the programme during its first 18 months, which will be of particular interest to low resource, post-conflict and fragile states that are seeking to establish their own basic <b>de-radicalisation</b> programmes...|$|E
40|$|Policies {{aimed at}} {{preventing}} (further) radicalisation or aimed at <b>de-radicalisation</b> {{are required to}} be 'evidence-based'. This suggests that evaluators should apply rigorous empirical methodology and measurement techniques.

In the present paper we present results of a literature review focusing on evaluations of programmes aimed at preventing radicalisation or <b>de-radicalisation</b> between 1990 until July 2014. We identified 55 manuscripts including 135 participant samples. Primary qualitative or quantitative empirical data about effectiveness of an intervention was presented in only 16 participant samples (12 %). The outcomes are discussed with respect to methods and interventions used in the research field of criminology, a valuable source of methodological experience in conducting evaluation research in challenging circumstances.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{is devoted}} to the development of Czech environmental movement in 1990 's which is accompanied by academic debate about <b>de-radicalisation.</b> The aim of the thesis is to explore what sort of particular changes in the field of political ideas could be identified behind notional <b>de-radicalisation.</b> For this purpose is first laid out the historical context within which the movements were created onto their political ideals. It is followed by an introduction of the theoretical approaches to analyse these ideologies, outlining the basic methodological assumptions for a morphological analysis of the journals of Hnuti Duha. This analysis shows that between the periods 1991 - 1994 and 1998 - 2000 can be seen significant ideological transformations that are linked both with the inclination to certain elements of conservative thought and partly an inclination to a non-political politics.

40|$|The {{challenge}} for contemporary Green parties in {{government is to}} demonstrate both {{that they have not}} been completely de-radicalised, and that their presence in government can make a difference. Green party involvement in the European Union (EU) adds distinctive elements to this challenge. Does engagement in supranational decision making provide new opportunities for Green parties to exercise influence beyond borders? Or does it simply further exacerbate <b>de-radicalisation</b> tendencies? Focusing on the German and Finnish Green parties, this article explores the 'European dimension' of Green parties' governmental incumbency. Three sets of literature (Europeanisation, party change and EU policy making) are used to derive and test several hypotheses related to the impact of EU involvement on Green parties, and the impact of Green parties on EU policy making. It is argued that EU governmental engagement has accelerated Green party <b>de-radicalisation</b> both organisationally and programmatically, but the dynamics of this process are complex and surprisingly interactive as Greens also attempt to exercise influence over EU policy. The findings are relevant not just for those studying Green parties, but for those exploring wider questions of Europeanisation, party change and EU policy making. ...|$|E
40|$|Project SAFIRE (Scientific Approach to Finding Indicators and Responses tot Radicalisation) is {{a three-year}} {{research}} project {{that started in}} 2010. It consists out of a consortium of ten partners in six EU countries. Its objectives are to improve {{the understanding of the}} process of radicalisation from moderation to (violent) extremism and to use this knowledge to design and provide theoretical argumentation and empirical evidence for the implementation of practical interventions and related means to prevent, halt, or reverse the process of violent radicalisation in Europe. The SAFIRE project is broad in its scope, examining radicalisation from its theoretical and conceptual underpinnings, to identifying observable indicators of radicalisation and making recommendations for counter- and <b>de-radicalisation</b> programmes, to modelling the process of radicalisation and collecting new empirical data on radicalisation. One of the main conclusions is that the process of radicalisation should not be investigated only form a security perspective. Instead, the research suggests the importance of focusing prevention programmes on identity formation in young adults, as well as creating positive experiences regarding citizenship while reducing negative emotions.

40|$|The {{continuity}} {{of terrorism and}} political violence {{from generation to generation}} demonstrates the need to go beyond a focus on groups or individuals in order to explain how terrorism ends. The concept of <b>de-radicalisation</b> has been critiqued for its lack of explanatory value in accounting for disengagement from terrorism or how the risk of terrorism re-emerging is reduced. However, building on the morphogenetic approach, this book distinguishes between structure/culture and agency over time in order to analyse the causal influence between the two. Two processes are analysed: disengagement framing processes explain how actors change attitudes to violence and the book identifies which factors ensure frames resonate with audiences; and social movement <b>de-radicalisation</b> accounts for the outcomes of disengagement in initiating structural change which transforms the landscape the next generation finds itself in. The fundamental aim of the book is to provide theoretical and conceptual insights into how terrorism can not only come to an end, but can be prevented from emerging to be a significant threat again within a society. This book will be of much interest to students of terrorism and political violence, social movement theory, British and Irish Politics, war and conflict studies, security studies and IR in general...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of studies have looked at the disengagement/de-radicalisation of {{terrorist}} groups and individuals. This article critically assesses part of this literature in relation to the process of voluntary collective disengagement, using the case of the Palestinian Fatah organization as an example. It questions the specific focus of most <b>de-radicalisation</b> studies upon solely ending the use of the terrorist tactic, arguing that the disengagement process should be studied in conjunction with groups ceasing to use other forms of political violence as well. Although the article favours an objective definition of terrorism, it also recognises the salience of the term's normative power and argues that both perspectives can play a role in the disengagement process. This process can be divided into {{a number of}} stages: (i) declarative disengagement, (ii) behavioural disengagement, (iii) organisational disengagement, and (iv) <b>de-radicalisation.</b> Fatah's disengagement process demonstrates that the process can be conditional, reversible, and selective. Consequently, a number of problems arise in terms of defining when an organisation has actually ceased to use terrorism and other forms of political violence. The article argues that Fatah represents a case of mixed disengagement; it was selective, conditional and mostly only behavioural. However, despite the disengagement process only being partially successful during the Oslo period - and reversed considerably during the al-Aqsa Intifada - it has had some lasting effects on the organisation, making it less likely to re-engage in terrorism...|$|E

40|$|This article investigates {{one aspect}} of what the Dutch {{government}} can do to reduce the risks posed by Dutch jihadists who are currently fighting in Syria. The Dutch government has developed a comprehensive action programme to combat jihadism which outlines measures designed to combat the jihadist movement in the Netherlands. The comprehensive action programme includes plans to develop an exit facility to help people leaving the jihadist movement. Furthermore, a support facility needs to be created, based on the German network model. Of this network the Hayat programme will be analysed in-depth together with the EXIT-Deutschland programme. Hayat is a civil society programme that includes working with relatives of radicalised individuals and tries to de-radicalise these individuals. Hayat’s programme is amongst others based on experiences gained from EXIT-Deutschland, a <b>de-radicalisation</b> programme focusing on de-radicalising individual members of the radical right movement. The exit-facility that the Dutch government wants to create and the support facility are only explained vaguely and {{have not yet been}} introduced. This research investigates how and to what extent Hayat’s and EXIT-Deutschland’s elements can successfully be transferred to the Netherlands. This research recommends focusing on disengaging instead of <b>de-radicalisation.</b> The programme should be executed by an NGO with expert witness status. Furthermore, an active approach to contacting returnees is considered best in line with the Dutch government’s objectives. Important elements of the German programme can be transferred to the Netherlands. These elements include using a personal approach, providing returnees with alternatives and family counselling, and generally - apart from the already existing repressive measures - focusing on positive measures. This article also outlines the ways in which such a transfer of best practises can be best achieved...|$|E

A number of these interviews were completed with respondents across government and academia. However, there was a specific focus on conducting interviews with the data set termed as the ‘informed informants’.

The article also takes a critical gaze towards families, suggesting that this may detract attention away from the wider socio-political factors that also {{play a significant role in}} radicalisation. A focus upon families can also inadvertently lead to the creation and perpetuation of a ‘suspect community’.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{politics}} of Sri Lanka's Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the post- 1994 period, when it re-created itself as a mainstream parliamentary political party and came to {{play a critical role}} in the collapse of the 2001 – 2004 peace process. The fundamental analytical enigma of the JVP lies in explaining its hybrid Marxist/Sinhala nationalist persona, which enabled it to craft a highly effective campaign of opposition to the Ranil Wickremasinghe government's two-track agenda of peace with market reforms. This paper examines how the JVP's Marxism relates to its Sinhala nationalism, and how it fits within the Sri Lanka's Marxist tradition as a whole. It argues that the JVP's increasing emphasis on Sinhala nationalism post- 1999 has occurred in the context of <b>de-radicalisation</b> and parliamentary habilitation, and discusses the relevance of its ideological orientation to the material basis of Sinhala nationalism and its relationship with the social democratic state...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper investigates {{whether and}} to what extent there may have been an ideological shift in the realisation of development education policy and practice over the past three decades. Using the United Kingdom as a case study, the paper provides {{a review of the literature}} in the field and investigates the extent to which the introduction of the Primary School Curriculum through the Education Reform Act (1988) may have had an effect on the teaching and learning of development issues within schools. Using a conceptual framework loosely based on the work of Andriotti (2008) which interrogates the narrative used in policy formation, the paper provides a comparative analysis of policy and curriculum documents. The overt and subliminal ideological perspectives adopted in these documents are interrogated to determine the relative positioning regarding how best development issues might be addressed. A critical analysis of findings is then used as the basis to determine whether there has been a <b>de-radicalisation</b> of the ways in which development education policy and content is addressed particularly in the contexts of formal education...|$|E
40|$|Building on the {{analysis}} of party communication in the 2007 presidential campaign in France, this paper explores two correlated aspects of change in patterns of partisan competition in the right pole of French politics. Looking at the strategic responses by the UMP {{to the rise of}} the FN in 2002, we examine first the process of profound ideological revision under Sarkozy’s leadership. The emphasis is on the reformulation of two archaeological repertoires of the French conservative New Right –namely anti-egalitarianism and cultural differentialism – and how this ‘winning formula ’ was successfully articulated with strong populist and anti-establishment appeals. In the second section, this distinctive trajectory is contrasted with the transformation and adaptation of the FN to the new party system configuration that emerged from Le Pen’s Pyrrhic victory of 2002. The focus is on the <b>de-radicalisation</b> of the party’s programmatic appeal in 2007 and a significant re-interpretation of its traditional ethnicised mythology of national identity. Implications for the characterisation of the radical Right phenomenon in France are discussed in the conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Osama bin Laden’s demise in May 2011 marked {{only the}} {{symbolic}} {{end of an}} era. By {{the time of his}} killing, he no longer represented the Robin Hood icon that once stirred global fascination. Ten years after the 11 September 2001 attacks, jihadi terrorism has largely lost its juggernaut luster. It now mostly resembles a patchwork of self-radicalising local groups with international contacts but without any central organisational design - akin to the radical left terrorism of the 1970 s and the anarchist fin-de-siècle terrorism. This volume addresses two issues that remain largely unexplored in contemporary terrorism studies. It rehabilitates the historical and comparative analysis as a way to grasp the essence of terrorism, including its jihadi strand. Crucial similarities with earlier forms of radicalisation and terrorism abound and differences appear generally not fundamental. Likewise, the very concept of radicalisation is seldom questioned anymore. Nevertheless it often lacks conceptual clarity and empirical validation. Once considered a quintessential European phenomenon, the United States too experiences how some of its own citizens radicalise into terrorist violence. This collective work compares radicalisation in both continents and the strategies aimed at <b>de-radicalisation.</b> But it also assesses if the concept merits its reputation as the holy grail of terrorism studies...|$|E
40|$|Although non-state armed {{groups are}} primary {{stakeholders}} in contemporary political conflicts, {{there has been}} little research into their members’ perspectives on internal factors shaping radicalisation and <b>de-radicalisation.</b> State and international actors often assume that bringing rebel leaders to the negotiating table or “converting” them to peaceful politicians means weakening, splitting, or dismantling militant structures. This paper re-evaluates those assumptions in the light of rebel leaders’ own accounts of internal organisational dynamics before, during, and after political conflicts and peace settlements. Participatory action research with “insider experts” from armed movements in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Nepal, Aceh, El Salvador, Colombia, and South Africa reveals insiders’ analysis of leadership and organisational dynamics during armed conflict and political talks and highlights the rational decision-making process whereby proactive leaders constantly (re) assess and adjust their tactics (from unarmed to armed and vice versa) as the strategic environment evolves. Horizontal and vertical communication between members is critical for enabling collective ownership of transformation processes from violent insurgency to peaceful transition and preventing internal splits and disaffection during peace negotiations. The claim that rebel organisations should be dismantled as quickly as possible during peace processes is found to be dubious, highlighting instead the importance of retaining cohesive coordination and communication structures during volatile post-war transitions...|$|E
40|$|<b>De-radicalisation</b> policy {{carries with}} it an {{inherent}} tension: those who provide the most invaluable support in drawing people away from violent extremist groups generally come from the demographic or community that is under suspicion. This is true even when the extremist ideology is simple for governments and state agencies to understand – such as certain political or nationalist demands – due to the credibility and reach held by members of community. Yet when government lacks not only trust and moral authority with a target demographic, but a theological and cultural knowledge which is central to understanding {{the nature of the}} extremist threat (as with violent Islamist extremism), partnering with civil society actors from the community takes on a vital importance. Partnering with community members has therefore been a central and indispensable part of the UK’s Prevent strategy, but how to do so has at times been a disputed, chronically under-researched, ideologically driven political quagmire. The Lokahi Foundation is currently conducting a long research project, funded by the European Community, to assess the lessons that can be identified from the United Kingdom’s responses to extremism and ‘radicalization’.

40|$|The book {{analyses}} {{in depth}} the leaders {{and members of}} both extreme-left and extreme-right terrorist groups, which operated in Italy in the 1960 s and 1970 s {{and in many cases}} were charged and convicted for their acts of violence. In the last two decades, and especially in recent years, former extreme-right terrorists have started to talk about their past involvement in terrorist violence, including, for the first time, acts of violence which have for decades been considered taboo, that is to say, bomb attacks against innocent civilians. Surprisingly, these narratives have not been systematically examined, yet they form a unique and extremely rich source of first-hand testimony, providing invaluable insight into processes of youth radicalisation and <b>de-radicalisation,</b> social re-integration of ex-terrorists, as well as personal and collective healing through cultural dialogue among perpetrators, victims and survivors. The memoirs construct ‘myths and plots’ about the past, that can be self-justificatory or indeed self-critical or penitent. They reveal the crucial importance of narratives in bridging the gap between rhetoric and action, in what is a dual process of ‘victimisation’ and ‘violentisation’, in which ideology plays an important, but not necessarily crucial, role. Post incarceration, the study further asks what was the specific role of the former Italian communist party (PCI, then PDS, DS, PD) on the one hand, and the former Neofascist party (MSI, then AN), on the other, in the process of disengagement and reintegration of the ‘terrorist subject’ back into the non-violent community. Finally, what has the role been of victims’ associations, commemoration ceremonies, monuments and other cultural initiatives in providing a wider context of ‘pacification’...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that tends to conflate Arab foreign fighters with Islamist terrorists, and ‘martyrdom operations’ with ‘suicide attacks. ’ Overlaps notwithstanding, it aims to draw distinctions between Arab foreign fighters engaged in defensive jihad defending co-religionists against a military foe, and Islamist terrorists engaged in terrorism that indiscriminately targets civilians and non-combatants. Critically, while disaggregating the two transnational cohorts, this thesis also illuminates the nexus between them. It draws on a thesis dataset of 3, 010 Arab foreign fighters compiled using biographies, martyrdom eulogies, and postings on ‘jihadi’ websites, in both English and Arabic. This dataset is then used to support three case studies involving the defensive jihads in 1980 s Afghanistan, Iraq (post 2003), and Syria (post 2011). It leverages a theoretical framework based on the concept of radicalisation and the language of political Islam, whilst concurrently drawing on theories from psychology and historical military examples of combat, germane to defensive jihad and Islamist terrorism. The thesis concludes that Arab foreign fighters involved in defensive jihad employ martyrdom operations against military targets, through tactical necessity. Conversely, Islamist terrorists employ suicide attacks against civilians and non-combatants, through ideological necessity. The trajectory between the two transnational mobilisations appears to be broadly underpinned by facets of the Lucifer Effect – the situational factors encountered whilst participating in defensive jihad, including but not limited to, the experience of close combat in a war zone; being subjected to ideological indoctrination; and being exposed to charismatic authority and obedience to it. This suggests that subsequent involvement in Islamist terrorism by some Arab foreign fighters is primarily forged in the crucible of defensive jihad. Such findings should result in the crafting of more individualised <b>de-radicalisation</b> and rehabilitation programmes for returning foreign fighters, in both the West and the Arab world...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{explains}} how terrorism campaigns end, using social movement theory to analyse the Provisional IRA’s disengagement from armed violence {{and how this}} led others in the Irish Republican movement {{to move away from}} violence and remain so. The thesis argues that successful disengagement is dependent on how it is framed {{and the extent to which}} it resonates within the movement. Frame resonance is shaped by the extent it is consistent with the group’s goals, the presence of linkages in order to diffuse the frame, and the perceived credibility of those advocating it. This process ensured that most of the Provisional IRA supported disengagement, which then began to organisationally disengage as part of the peace process. Subsequently, linkages were built up with the Irish Republican movement, leading to the disengagement frame to become de-radicalised, thus providing stronger barriers against violence. The disengagement frame’s resonance in the Irish Republican movement, underpinned by political/structural change, has led to a durable decline in terrorism and political violence. The thesis’ original contribution has five dimensions: 1) the thesis draws on interviews with a broader range of actors typically found in terrorism studies; 2) the re-conceptualisation of <b>de-radicalisation</b> provides nuanced explanations of why attitudinal change is important for ending terrorism; 3) the thesis provides the first multi-level analysis of how terrorism ends by using a social movement approach, thus providing a more comprehensive explanation; 4) while many have recognised the ‘next generation’ as a crucial factor, the thesis is the first to analyse the interaction between generations and how the break in inter-generational support for violence emerges; and 5) the thesis challenges many assumptions on organisational disengagement by outlining how informal networks of combatants continue to exist, but shows how this can actually prevent terrorism rather than just pose a risk to recidivism. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review {{is to examine the}} scholarly literature on the process(es) of radicalisation, particularly among young people, and the availability of interventions to prevent extremism. The review was undertaken to inform the national evaluation of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales’ (YJB) preventing violent extremism programmes within the youth justice system, and as such, represents one of the research outputs from that study. The full evaluation report, Process Evaluation of Preventing Violent Extremism Programmes for Young People, is to be published by the YJB alongside this review. The review found that the evidence base for effective preventing violent extremism interventions is very limited. Despite a prolific output of research, few studies contained empirical data or systematic data analysis. Furthermore, although a growing body of literature investigating the radicalisation process is emerging, the weight of that literature is focused upon terrorism rather than radicalisation. As such, the evidence is concerned with that smaller cohort of individuals who, once radicalised, go on to commit acts of violence in the pursuit of political or religious aims and objectives. This introduces a systematic bias in the literature, away from the radicalisation process that preceeds terrorism, including radicalisation that does not lead to violence. Despite these limitations, the systematic review found that Islamic radicalisation and terrorism emanate from a very heterogeneous population that varies markedly in terms of education, family background, socio-economic status and income. Several studies have identified potential risk factors for radicalisation, and, among these, political grievances (notably reaction to Western foreign policy) have a prominent role. The review found only two evaluated UK programmes that explicitly aimed to address Islamic radicalisation in the UK. These were outreach and engagement projects running in London: the Muslim Contact Unit (MCU) and the ‘Street’ Project. In addition, the review drew heavily upon the Department for Communities and Local Government’s (DCLG) rapid evidence assessment, Preventing Support for Violent Extremism through Community Interventions: A Review of the Evidence (Pratchett et al, 2010). This advocated the adoption of capacity building and empowering young people, and interventions that “challenge ideology that focus on theology and use education/training”. The Netherlands-based Slotervaart Project was identified as an exemplar of the outreach/community-based approach recommended by the DCLG review. The review also considered a number of <b>de-radicalisation</b> programmes operating in several Islamic countries and programmes tackling right-wing radicalisation. These programmes provide some potential learning points for future UK programmes, chiefly around the need for those engaging with radicalised individuals to carry authority and legitimacy, and to be equipped with profound ideological knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Since 9 / 11, {{both in the}} Middle East and worldwide, the academic, {{political}} and religious focus on extreme radicalisation has intensified. The attacks carried out in Riyadh, {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by Al-Qaeda in 2003, motivated a succession of bombings within and outside of the Kingdom. These events have led to a plethora of general and specific studies to understand the phenomenon of extremism. This thesis investigates radicalisation in Saudi Arabia since 2001, focusing on the impact of Al-Qaeda and its impact on individuals and the state. It specifically focuses {{on the role of the}} Mohammed bin Naif Centre for Counselling, Rehabilitation and Care, in this context referred to as ‘the Centre’, analysing its function as a tool for the ‘soft power’ strategy that has been initiated by the Saudi Arabian Government, intended to de-radicalise individuals who are perceived by the state to have been misled. The study uses a detailed literature review to unpack the historical trends regarding the origins of Saudi Arabia, the political differences therein, as well as the different religious interpretations which are attributed as being a root cause of discontent which thereby leads to radicalisation and violent extremism in the region. In this thesis, I trace the various schools of thought regarding the treatment of religion and governance in relation to local and international politics, and how this impacts upon the radicalisation of individuals. A Critical Terrorism Studies (CTS) approach is used to highlight the need to view studies on security from a reflexive perspective, both in the researcher and the researched subject matter, namely the terrorist organisations and the governments against which they are fighting. The concept of governance is analysed and how this either precipitates or prevents dissent that results in violence. In addition, the {{political and}} religious solutions to radicalisation are assessed, with a specific focus on the <b>de-radicalisation</b> process, as reflected through a qualitative research on the views and thinking of the practitioners working in the Centre. In this context, I investigate the motives, roles, responsibilities and strategies used in executing their roles, with the aim of seeking possible explanations for the causes of radicalisation and the challenges faced in de-radicalising individuals. Their views are used to form the main basis for the data for this research. This study should be of interest to politicians, security experts, academics, religious leaders, Islamic scholars and interested individuals. It will be a valuable contribution towards an understanding of the causes, consequences and possible solutions to addressing Islamic extremism and radicalisation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of Western females travelling to Syria and Iraq in support of ISIS. Introduction Although often assumed to be passive agents, women have played significant roles {{in a number of}} contemporary terrorist organizations. Violent extremist groups across the political and ideological spectrum have utilised female forces for a range of activities including logistics, recruitment, political safeguarding, operations, suicide bombing and combat. However, the recent unprecedented surge in female recruits to the terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS) has brought this phenomenon into sharp focus. For many there remain misperceptions and misunderstandings concerning the role women play within these violent networks, often paired with engendered responses to the radicalisation of women. By analysing how terrorist organisations choose to utilise women, we are able to better understand the decision-making processes of terrorists and the inner-workings of the organization itself. The number of Western foreign fighters and migrants to ISIS is estimated to be up to 4, 000, with over 550 women within this figure. This unprecedented number of Western male foreign terrorist fighters is paralleled by an equally unprecedented number of women traveling to support ISIS. Questions are now being posed as to how and why females are being recruited en masse, what role they play for ISIS, and what tools will best work to counter this new threat. Yet very little work has been done to not only answer these questions but to build sustainable preventative measures. This report attempts to shed light on these questions as the second publication within ISD’s Women and Extremism (WaE) programme. The first WaE report, Becoming Mulan? Female Western Migrants to ISIS, addressed some of the reasons for Western females traveling to ISIS-territory and exposed key elements of the reality for females upon arrival ISIS-controlled territory. This report aims to expand upon previous research by giving depth to understanding who is being radicalized, why these women decide to depart for Syria and how we can better stop these processes. There are three primary sections to this report. The first maps the primary push and pull factors which prime women and lead them down a path of violent radicalisation to the point at which they decide they must make hijra (migrate) to join ISIS. These factors disprove the one-dimensional label for these women, who are often referred to simply as ‘jihadi brides’. The second section of this report gives indepth profiles of 7 English-speaking females who have successfully journeyed to join ISIS and are now resident in the so-called Islamic State. These profiles show the diversity among female recruits and expose everything from their driving motivations, worldviews and subsequent roles under ISIS control. The final section of this report looks at counter-extremism work in the space of prevention and <b>de-radicalisation,</b> showing how various Western governments are operating within this space and analysing where better infrastructure is needed to address the topic of gender within processes of radicalisation...|$|E
40|$|The Ethnic Communities’ Council of Victoria (ECCV) is {{the peak}} {{advocacy}} organisation for ethnic and multicultural groups in Victoria. This social cohesion policy brief {{is the second}} of a two part discussion addressing community concern over future government ‘deradicalisation’ initiatives. After {{the implementation of the}} Federal Government’s Living Safe Together program, culturally diverse communities expressed concern to ECCV about what will happen in Victoria. Community leaders, service providers and individuals were invited to share their views and questions were centred on: identifying effective models of social cohesion initiatives, the effect of social cohesion policies on Victorian multiculturalism, how NGOs and government share responsibility and how young people can find trusted spaces to safely explore their strong emotions. With the language constantly changing around government approaches to community-based <b>de-radicalisation</b> programs, participants responded that these programs could stigmatise some groups. While there were insightful comments from participants – all included in this brief - the roundtable also revealed different perceptions of multiculturalism. At first we felt this hindered a deeper response to our questions until we realised that this hurdle was a deeper issue. Comments pointed to a need for multiculturalism in Victoria to become more intergenerational in dimension and to learn from the past while living in the present and planning for the future. While social cohesion’s role in this remained unclear there were many lessons to be applied today. A government approach that targets communities without properly mapping intergenerational shifts in identity around multiculturalism is bound to be ineffective. Navigating that complexity requires the design of contextually-driven programs that go beyond “older” and “younger. ” For example, the emphasis on Muslim youth overlooks publically organised and systemic racism and the increasing acceptability of more public expressions of racism. Global ‘inter-cultural’ shifts reflected among different multicultural generations in Victoria are also not adequately reflected in Victorian multicultural policies, legislation and language established in the 1980 s and 90 s. These barriers to social cohesion initiatives are not clearly understood. The Victorian Government indicates that it is important for governments to work with NGOs. In the UK research shows a desire to learn from mistakes of the past 10 years with less focus on policing and military measures, and with more focus needed on social and community engagement. Participants supported collaboration, but service providers are limited in delivering their services if social cohesion is built into too many of their grants.  There was a sense in the room that people did not feel safe in Victoria at the present time. A lack of leadership at the national level is affecting how safe Victorian multicultural communities feel ‘on the ground’. The media is not without some responsibility for this. However, communities are reticent to provide this feedback to government if grants across sectors become tied to social cohesion as they are already struggling with resources to deliver their services.  ECCV will integrate the feedback from this discussion into our next roundtable and the development of ECCVs Biennial State Conference in 2016...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{so-called}} ´family hotlines’ {{were launched}} in the Netherlands, France, Austria, serving {{as a resource for}} the parents and relatives who are confronted with the (potential) foreign fighter phenomenon. The hotline connects callers with social and religious services in an effort help prevent the (further) radicalisation of young Muslims or support families whose loved ones have travelled to Syria. In other countries such as Denmark (Aarhus) family talk groups were set up by the municipality or by affected parents, such as ‘Les parents concernés’ in Belgium. Family support is a relatively new approach within counter-radicalisation policy in which the Germans pioneered since 2012. Supporting families is considered valuable for several reasons and can be provided at different stages (Gielen, 2014) : In its earliest stages, family support can be provided to parents of individuals at risk, by addressing their concerns, working on (maintaining) a positive family environment with an open atmosphere in which they can discuss extremist ideas with their child and provide positive alternatives. If radical or extremist ideas lead to travel to a conflict zone abroad, such as Syria or Iraq, foreign fighters quite often remain in touch with their families back home. Family support can then be aimed at maintaining contact with their children or relatives and in creating a positive environment for a child to return home; When extremist views turn into violence and ultimately imprisonment, families can be supported whilst their relative is imprisoned or afterwards in the re-integration and re-habilitation process, such going back to school and helping them find a job. If practitioners are able to create and sustain a relationship with families of foreign fighters, then it will be easier to create an entry point for contact with the foreign fighter upon his/her return. This is of particular importance, as families are also crucial for <b>de-radicalisation</b> and disengagement work. Moreover, family members such as brothers, sisters, cousins, but also peers, form an at-risk group of travelling to Syria. Supporting families and the broader professional network of the family (such as school teachers) should enable practitioners and family members to act upon early warning signals and prevent travel of other family members or peers; Providing family support can work as a very powerful narrative for foreign fighters to come home. A lot of foreign fighters are afraid of returning because they fear prosecution or Guantanamo Bay. In one country were family and individual support was offered on a local level, parents spread the word that ‘the government was there to help them’. This message found its way back to the foreign fighters in Syria, providing a powerful narrative and highlighting the internal/external and local/global dimension of providing support; Finally, foreign fighters cause a lot of grief, anxiety, despair and upset for family members to the point they are no longer actively able to participate in society (not able to work etc.) for which psychological counselling is essential. This article will focus on family support as part of counter-radicalisation policy. How can its effectiveness be measured? To answer this question, this article will draw on realistic evaluation which revolves around ‘what works, for who, in which context and how? (Pawson & Tilley 1997). It will discuss the different forms and merits of family support across Europe by drawing upon the lessons learned of practitioners engaging in family support within the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) including two case studies in which support was provided offered to families of foreign fighters by myself. Based on these practitioner experiences hypotheses on family support as part of a counter-radicalisation strategy are developed which in turn could be used for empirical testing...|$|E
