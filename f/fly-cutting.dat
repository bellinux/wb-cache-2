40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the machining mechanisms that accompany the single-point diamond <b>fly-cutting</b> operation in grooving of brittle materials. Single-point diamond <b>fly-cutting</b> is widely used in precision machining of free-form optics, semiconductor devices, and micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) components among many others. The undeformed chip zone was analyzed and its relation to the critical brittle/ductile transition depth of cut was discussed. Then, a mechanics-based model was proposed to describe the material stress condition under the diamond tool. The machining parameters were incorporated into the model to understand <b>fly-cutting</b> behavior. It was shown that the <b>fly-cutting</b> technique is highly suitable for the ductile removal of brittle materials by generating large compressive pressures in the chip formation zone. This condition can be further enhanced by a small feedrate and a large negative rake angle of the diamond tool used. The theoretical results were substantiated and verified by fly-grooving experiments performed on mono-crystalline silicon. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag London...|$|E

In this paper the influence of both planarization techniques on 20 μm pitch Cu and CuNiSn bumps embedded in polymer are studied. The polymer protects the bumps from the shearing force of the planarization process and will later serve as a underfill material for the resulting gap of a 3 D stack.

This paper presents recent advances in developing a tool holder for diamond <b>fly-cutting</b> that enables the alignment {{of two or more}} cutting edges via thermal elongation of the substrate material. After building a comprehensive model of the actuator and verifying it in a static test setup, a closed-loop control was developed that allows setting the elongation in a static setup with nanometer accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a new and}} {{innovative}} method for the patterning of grinding wheels is presented. The patterns are machined with a patterning tool by using <b>fly-cutting</b> kinematics. By changing the patterning process parameters, different pattern sizes and densities can be machined in a flexible way. Surface and cylindrical grinding experiments show that grinding with patterned grinding wheels can significantly reduce process forces, grinding burn, and grinding power. The surface roughness increases because less active cutting edges remain when grinding with patterned wheels. But especially for roughing processes, the results show great potential for increasing the overall grinding performance. The final publication is available at Springer via [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the diamond cutting based {{generation}} of hierarchical micro-nanostructures, which are conventionally difficult for both mechanical and non-mechanical methods to achieve. A novel end-fly-cutting-servo (EFCS) system, with four-axis servo motions that combine the concepts of fast/slow tool servo and end-face <b>fly-cutting,</b> is proposed and investigated. In the EFCS system, an intricately shaped primary surface is generated by material removal, while the desired secondary nanostructures are simultaneously constructed using residual tool marks by actively controlling tool loci. The potential of the EFCS system is demonstrated firstly by fabricating a nanostructured F-theta freeform surface and a nanostructured micro-aspheric array.

For the realisation of high stiffness and good damping characteristics hydrostatic guideways are used. However, the dominated feature of the linear axis is the design of a mass decoupling system that allows the reduction of the prefaced machine base forces of more than 60 %. With this, a very high dynamic and also precise movement can be realised. The developed axis allows the machining of planar groove structures by planing faster than <b>fly-cutting,</b> with the same lateral straightness quality and surface roughness...|$|E

40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manufacturing processes, especially when high surface qualities have to be realized or if hard or brittle materials have to be machined. Often the grinding performance is limited by workpiece failure due to a high thermal load in the contact zone. Therefore structured or patterned grinding wheels are frequently used to reduce the thermal load in the contact zone. In this paper a new patterning method will be introduced by using a <b>fly-cutting</b> kinematic for the structuring process. In face grinding experiments the patterned grinding wheels showed great potential to enhance the overall grinding performance by significantly decreasing process forces and grinding burn. The reduction of the thermal load in the contact zone can be explained by an improved coolant flow through the contact zone, which was measured with a specially designed coolant collecting bin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrostructuring is one {{suitable}} {{method to}} improve the tribological properties of surfaces. It leads {{to a reduction in}} friction and wear, especially in highly loaded tribological contacts. There are several machining techniques to generate microstructures, such as laser beam removal, cold forming, etching or <b>fly-cutting.</b> This paper describes a new method to produce microstructured surfaces more economically, based on a two- staged vibration-assisted turning process. During the first step, a specific microstructure is realized by ultrasonic vibration assistance of the turning tool in the direction perpendicular to the workpiece surface. In the subsequent step, the peaks of the obtained microstructured surface are removed by precision turning without vibration. This results in a plateau-shaped and microdimpled surface. The two-staged vibration- assisted turning process offers the advantage that no additional process is required after finishing because the microstructuring process is already part of the finishing operation. The investigated process can easily be integrated into large batch production, e. g., for tribological optimization of powertrain components...|$|E

30|$|Aerostatic bearings, {{which are}} nearly frictionless, require low driving power and possess high {{accuracy}} of movement, {{have been widely}} used in ultra-precision machine tools. With regard to the static and dynamic characteristics of aerostatic bearings, stiffness and stability {{play a key role in}} achieving nanometer-level motion precision. Huo et al. [1] pointed out that ultra-precision micro milling machine required a high stiffness aerostatic bearings to maintain high accuracy in the presence of large cutting forces. Gao et al.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for surface quality of workpieces such as metal-optics are increasing, specially {{if they are}} used as optics in high energy laser systems. This fact leads to an ongoing optimization effort of the microturning respectively <b>fly-cutting</b> process with a single point diamond tool. A selection of insufficiently machined workpieces has demonstrated that vibrations at the cutting zone modulate the surface contour. Recent measurements {{have shown that the}} static and dynamic compliance of ultraprecision machines has a great influence on these effects. In here statistically. Further examinations have pointed out {{that it is possible to}} correlate the measured vibration amplitudes at tool and headstock during the cutting process with the generated texture on the workpiece. The goal of the research work demonstrated in this article is to find out a measuring approach by using interferograms of machined surfaces. This enables to analyse the machine tool behaviour in process. It is necess ary to generate computerized interferograms which comprise the surface modulation caused by measured machine tool vibrations. Through the comparison of real and computerized interferograms it is possible to detect the vibration frequencies modulating the surface in a quality reducing manner. The man in the shop floor will be able to improve the machining process by comparing real and computerized interferograms of the machined surfaces. (IPT...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge of {{interest}} in the research, development and testing of Silicon Carbide (SiC) [1]. SiC has found numerous applications in a variety of industries including aerospace, semiconductors and optics. The effective use of this material has brought about increasing demands for higher form accuracy and better surface quality coupled with lower costs [2]. The machining of this hard and brittle material, to achieve the required surface finish, is presumed to be made possible due to the metallic nature of its High Pressure Phase (HPP), which allows it to behave in a ductile fashion at room temperatures [3]. Since grinding and polishing are widely recognized to be slow and costly in most applications, there is a continuing motivation to use single point diamond turning (SPDT) to eliminate some of these steps [4]. Experiments involving Single Point Diamond Turning (SPDT) performed {{on the edge of a}} single crystal wafer of SiC (6 H) have demonstrated the ability to remove this material in a ductile fashion with the formation of chips similar to conventional metal machining [5]. Further, this paper [5] identified a ductile to brittle transition in accordance with the six fold symmetry of the crystal structure. Recent published work [4] made use of a <b>fly-cutting</b> operation to identify the critical chip thickness along different directions on the (001) cubic face of a silicon workpiece...|$|E

Nevertheless hard to machine high strength materials (hardened steel, tungsten carbide, and titanium, ceramic) which are usually required for such applications challenging associated machining technologies. Material based machining strategy is the first main influencing variable and the development of adapted process chains is object of research by Fraunhofer IWU and ENIMS in the frame of Russian-German Innovative project IWUMASH. Further the associated machine tools are the second influencing variable to guarantee necessary geometrical tolerances and surface qualities for micro and precision applications. In this context machine tools for cutting processes (µ-milling, µ-drilling, <b>Fly-Cutting,</b> Nano-Hobbing) and ablation processes (µ-laser, µ-EDM and ECM) are developed and enhanced by Kugler GmbH, ENIMS and Fraunhofer IWU.

40|$|OAK-B 135 This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} to enhance our understanding {{and control of}} the response of ductile materials to extreme loading conditions such as those involved in impact loading. The project was designed with a focus on the role of friction in high rate deformation and shock studies. The work involves collaboration of the tribology group in Materials Science and Engineering at OSU and two groups at LANL, an impact loading group in the dynamic experimentation division and a computer simulation group in the applied physics division. The two teams are investigating the same materials pairs: Cu/Cu, Al/stainless steel (SS) and Ta/Al. The LANL team is providing impacted specimens for characterization at OS U. The LANL team has designed and built a rotating barrel gas gun apparatus that allows measurement of frictional force at an impacted interface over time scales of 0 to 50 {micro}s. Impact pressures are 0 - 150 MPa and sliding speeds can be up to 50 m/s. The stainless steel barrel can rotate at rates from 0 - 5000 rpm. An impactor rod is driven at up to 12 m/s against a target rod of the specimen material. Initial tests have been with OFHC Cu/Cu annealed to relax strains from the machining process. The grains are equiaxed and have 40 {micro}m grain size. In the velocity range 0 - 6 m/s, the friction force increases with velocity for time scales of order 25 {micro}s. The LANL team has also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of sliding for Cu/Cu and Al/Ta using embedded atom potentials as well as simpler systems using Lennard-Jones potentials (also used at OSU). The results show extensive plastic deformation and, in some cases, the formation of nanocrystals at the sliding interface. The dependence of friction force on sliding velocity, v, shows two regimes: a low speed regime in which friction force rises with v and a high speed regime in which it decreases. The experimental work at OSU has focused on three tasks: (1) designing and building an improved system for sliding tests at intermediate velocities, (2) developing appropriate pre-testing surface preparation and (3) developing post-test characterization techniques. The new pin/disk wear testing system can achieve sliding speeds up to 1 m/s in a range of environments and contact times as small as 0. 1 s. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was done on cross-sections of the as-machined annular OFHC copper samples. This revealed substructures consistent with extensive subsurface. These features would complicate our efforts to study the changes produced by impact with sliding. The samples should have a minimal amount of subsurface deformation prior to testing, so the deformation due to sliding will not be obscured. Therefore, a study was conducted to find a test specimen preparation method that would minimize subsurface deformation. Three machining methods were analyzed: lathe turning, <b>fly-cutting,</b> and electrical discharge machining (EDM). Post-machining annealing at 275 C for one hour in a vacuum furnace was also performed to remove deformation remaining from the machining processes. Microhardness was measured {{as a function of the}} distance from the machined surface. This was a simple way to determine the extent of subsurface deformation. The results show that annealed fly-cut samples are best for our purposes. Similar tests on pure aluminum samples suggest that annealing of fly-cut samples at 200 C for an hour is sufficient to remove subsurface deformation. The material tested at OSU was characterized using optical microscopy, SEM and TEM. Wear tracks and wear debris were analyzed using SEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). TEM samples were prepared using different techniques including dimpling, jet-polishing and chemical polishing. Innovative techniques involving a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) have also been explored. MD modeling at OSU has focused on simple amorphous materials. The results suggest that the flow of material close to the sliding interface is characterized by the formation of eddies, intimate mixing and ''diffusion-like'' growth of the mixed layer. When the sliding speed is sufficiently high, the strain rate allows vorticity to develop. A comparison of eddy sizes with nanocrystal sizes in actual tribomaterial suggests that vorticity is directly responsible for the formation of such nanocrystal material. It is suggested that the flow of material near the interface is similar to turbulent flow in fluids. The resulting eddies affects frictional energy dissipation and mechanical mixing. A mixing-layer model of turbulent flow is qualitatively consistent with velocity profiles and friction behavior revealed by MD simulations...|$|E
