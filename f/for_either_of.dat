5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these claims.|$|E
5|$|The teams mascots are a {{male and}} female polar bear. The male polar bear wears the Halla home jersey and the female polar bear wears the away jersey. She also wears a white skirt and has red eyes. No name has been {{released}} <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the polar bears.

5|$|Ælfric's {{appointment}} to Canterbury caused consternation with the clergy {{of the cathedral}} chapter. In reaction, the chapter sent two members to Rome ahead of Ælfric and tried to secure the archbishopric <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the monks. Pope Gregory V, however, would not appoint a candidate without royal permission, which neither of the monks had. Instead, when Ælfric arrived in Rome in 997, he was appointed and received the pallium, a symbol of an archbishop's authority. He also witnessed some miracles at the gravesite of Edward the Martyr at Shaftesbury Abbey, helping to lead to Edward's sainthood.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{dropped below}} 11th place overall {{heading into the}} stage 10 {{individual}} time trial, where the squad had three riders finish in the top ten. Cancellara's fourth-place ride was perhaps a disappointment, in that he finished a minute and 27 seconds slower than the stage winner Tony Martin, the rider seen as his chief rival for the world championships time trial. Fuglsang took sixth on the day and Monfort tenth, putting Fuglsang 12 seconds off the race lead in second place overall and Monfort sixth 59 seconds back. Both of them lost time in stage 11, finishing in a group 27 seconds back of the group containing most of the race's top riders, but both remained in the top ten overall. Both again fell down the standings in stage 14 on La Farrapona, a day when {{out of the first}} 50 riders no more than four finished together. Their overall positions reversed the next day on the storied Alto del Angliru. Monfort finished with a group that lost time to only six riders, while Fuglsang was a further minute and eight seconds down the road from his teammate. This left Monfort fifth overall and Fuglsang seventh, after Fuglsang had been the higher-placed of the two for the entire race to that point. The next major mountain was Peña Cabarga in stage 17. Both riders were well off the pace, with Monfort finishing 19th and Fuglsang 31st. Monfort still held sixth overall with the result, but Fuglsang fell out of the top ten, down to 12th place. Fuglsang improved a place to 11th after stage 19, when Wouter Poels, who had been ahead of him, finished six minutes behind the main field. Those were their final overall positions, with both Monfort's sixth place and Fuglsang's 11th representing the best such finishes <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> them in a Grand Tour. The day before the race ended, Bennati gave the team a second stage win, coming home first in a large sprint finish in stage 20 at Vitoria.|$|E

25|$|Two {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for the regulation of GLUT-4 expression at a transcriptional level – myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 enhancer factor (GEF). Mutations in the DNA binding regions <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these proteins results in ablation of transgene GLUT-4 expression. These results prompted a study in 2005 which showed that AMPK directly phosphorylates GEF, but it doesn’t seem to directly activate MEF2. AICAR treatment has been shown, however, to increase transport of both proteins into the nucleus, as well as increase the binding of both to the GLUT-4 promoter region.|$|E
25|$|Instances of {{ambiguity}} {{can be classified}} as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like Someone shot the servant of the actress {{who was on the}} balcony (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or The cop chased the criminal with a fast car (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Three sons of Govindachandra are known: Asphota-chandra, Rajya-pala and Vijaya-chandra. Asphotachandra {{bore the}} title Yuvaraja (heir apparent), as attested by 1134 CE {{inscription}}. Rajyapala bore the title Maharajaputra (prince), as attested by the 1143 CE Gagaha inscription and the 1146 CE Varanasi inscription. But the actual successor of Govindachandra was Vijayachandra, whose first inscription is dated 1168 CE. It {{is not known}} why Vijayachandra ascended the throne when Asphotachandra was the yuvaraja. It {{is possible that the}} other two princes died during Govindachandra's lifetime, or that Vijayachandra defeated them in a war of succession, but there is no concrete evidence <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these hypotheses.|$|E

Perhaps the greatest number of visitors will cross the top as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, also climbing Red Pike and Pillar.|$|E
25|$|While Acemoglu and Robinson {{attribute}} {{economic growth}} to institutions, {{there are other}} possible explanations, including geography, culture, and the ignorance of leaders. The alternative theories below are alternatives for the general framework posed by the book, rather than <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the two theories above. Though these theories all try to claim a major factor that drives economic development, they are not mutually exclusive. For example, geography does shape the natural resources available to a country. For example, a country given rich resources {{has the potential to}} become rich. On the other side, institutions determine how those resources are distributed and create incentives for different groups to be motivated to participate in economic development.|$|E
25|$|In 1878 Australia {{made their}} first tour to England. Their first match was against Nottinghamshire: Shrewsbury scored 8 in an innings {{victory for the}} home team. He scored 724 runs at 21.29 during {{the season with a}} top score of 74 not out. The {{following}} season was less successful - his average dropped to 15.78 and he was not selected <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the Gentlemen v Players fixtures. He toured North America in September 1879 with Richard Daft's XI, where the side won all six matches, all of them against odds (opposition teams of more than eleven players). During the 1880 season he scored 403 runs, his highest score, 66 not out, against the touring Australians.|$|E

England went on to qualify for Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands, by which time, Wright was approaching his 37th birthday and retired from club football shortly after the tournament. Only Mick Channon played more times for England without being selected for a World Cup or European Championships squad. However, during Channon's England career, which spanned the years 1972–1977, England failed to qualify <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these tournaments, while during Wright's they qualified for two European Championships and one World Cup.|$|E
25|$|In May 1973, Chikatilo {{committed}} {{his first}} known sexual assault upon {{one of his}} pupils. In this incident, he swam towards a 15-year-old girl and groped her breasts and genitals, ejaculating as the girl struggled against his grasp. Months later, Chikatilo sexually assaulted another teenage girl whom he had locked in his classroom. He was not disciplined <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these incidents, or for the occasions in which fellow teachers observed Chikatilo fondling himself {{in the presence of}} his students. One of Chikatilo's duties at this school was ensuring his students who boarded at the school were present in their dormitories in the evenings; on several occasions, he is known to have entered the girls' dormitory in the hope of seeing them undressed.|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote <b>for</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E
