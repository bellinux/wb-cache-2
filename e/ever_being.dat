5|$|A {{small number}} of copies of Ashen were sent to various people.

Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings.

The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not much chance of it <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E

On three separate occasions, Navy forced Baltimore back into its own end zone for a safety; these were not worth any points until 1882, however, so they offered Navy no benefit. The American and Chronicle reported that Maxwell, Craven, and Sample of Navy gave the strongest performances, but were also reckless in their play and were repeatedly penalized for jumping offside or kicking {{the ball out of}} play, a form of delay of game.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it.

The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

In 1899, Evers was invited to join Matthew Mullineux's British Isles team to tour Australia. Evers missed the First Test against Australia, which the tourists lost 13-3. After the defeat, Mullineux dropped himself from the Test team, and brought five new players in for the Second Test at Brisbane, <b>Evers</b> <b>being</b> one of them. After the British Isles beat the Australians in the Second Test, Evers found himself chosen for the final two Tests, both resulting in wins for the tourists.|$|R

5|$|Inspired by {{the actions}} of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 Mandela, Sisulu, and Slovo co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation", {{abbreviated}} MK). Becoming chairman of the militant group, Mandela gained ideas from literature on guerilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara {{as well as from the}} military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter's reputation, MK was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. Most early MK members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, Mandela moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo, and Bernstein, who put together the MK constitution. Although in later life Mandela denied, for political reasons, <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> a member of the Communist Party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela's death. According to the SACP, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied <b>ever</b> <b>being</b> present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E
