40|$|The first {{molecular}} {{and genetic}} characterization of a biochemical pathway for oxidation of the reduced phosphorus (P) compounds phosphite and <b>hypophosphite</b> is reported. The pathway was identified in Pseudomonas stutzeri WM 88, which {{was chosen for}} detailed studies {{from a group of}} organisms isolated based on their ability to oxidize <b>hypophosphite</b> (+ 1 valence) and phosphite (+ 3 valence) to phosphate (+ 5 valence). The genes required for oxidation of both compounds by P. stutzeri WM 88 were cloned on a single ca. 30 -kbp DNA fragment by screening for expression in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two lines of evidence suggest that <b>hypophosphite</b> is oxidized to phosphate via a phosphite intermediate. First, plasmid subclones that conferred oxidation of phosphite, but not <b>hypophosphite,</b> upon heterologous hosts were readily obtained. All plasmid subclones that failed to confer phosphite oxidation also failed to confer <b>hypophosphite</b> oxidation. No subclones that conferred only <b>hypophosphite</b> expression were obtained. Second, various deletion derivatives of the cloned genes were made in vitro and recombined onto the chromosome of P. stutzeri WM 88. Two phenotypes were displayed by individual mutants. Mutants with the region encoding phosphite oxidation deleted (based upon the subcloning results) lost the ability to oxidize either phosphite or <b>hypophosphite.</b> Mutants with the region encoding <b>hypophosphite</b> oxidation deleted lost only the ability to oxidize <b>hypophosphite.</b> The phenotypes displayed by these mutants also demonstrate that the cloned genes are responsible for the P oxidation phenotypes displayed by the original P. stutzeri WM 88 isolate. The DNA sequences of the minimal regions implicated in oxidation of each compound were determined. The region required for oxidation of phosphite to phosphate putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent phosphite transporter, an NAD+-dependent phosphite dehydrogenase, and a transcriptional activator of the lysR family. The region required for oxidation of <b>hypophosphite</b> to phosphite putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent <b>hypophosphite</b> transporter and an α-ketoglutarate-dependent <b>hypophosphite</b> dioxygenase.

One might enlarge further upon this topic, on the brutalising influence of beer, the sedative quality of lettuce, the stimulating consequences of curried chicken; but enough has been said to point our argument. It is, that such facts as this can surely indicate only one conclusion, and that is the entire dependence of literary qualities upon the diet of the writer.|$|E
