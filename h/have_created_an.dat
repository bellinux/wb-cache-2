Alligators feed upon animals that visit the hole.|$|E
5|$|The reforms enacted during Powell's term as {{governor}} gave Kentucky {{one of the}} top educational systems in the antebellum South. He also improved Kentucky's transportation system and vetoed legislation that he felt would <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth. Powell's election {{as governor}} marked the end of Whig dominance in Kentucky. Powell's predecessor, John J. Crittenden, was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's favorite son, Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest that rules {{for the use of}} DRS <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E

5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As {{a result of the}} 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Maniac Mansion enthusiasts {{have drawn}} fan art of its characters, participated in tentacle-themed cosplay and {{produced}} a trailer for a fictitious film adaptation of the game. German fan Sascha Borisow created a fan-game remake, entitled Maniac Mansion Deluxe, with enhanced audio and visuals. He used the Adventure Game Studio engine to develop the project, which he distributed free of charge on the Internet. By the end of 2004, the remake had over 200,000 downloads. A remake with three-dimensional graphics called Meteor Mess {{was created by the}} German developer Vampyr Games, and, as of 2011, another group in Germany is producing one with art direction similar to that of Day of the Tentacle. Fans <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> episodic series of games based on Maniac Mansion as well. Gilbert has said {{that he would like to}} see an official remake, similar in its graphics and gameplay to The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition and Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge. However, he expressed doubts about its potential quality, in light of George Lucas' enhanced remakes of the original Star Wars trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{because of}} its {{potential}} use as a gene therapy vector, researchers <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> altered AAV called self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and requires the process of second-strand synthesis, scAAV packages both strands which anneal together to form double stranded DNA. By skipping second strand synthesis scAAV allows for rapid expression in the cell. Otherwise, scAAV carries many characteristics of its AAV counterpart.|$|E

25|$|Societal stratification, and the {{inequality}} {{that comes}} with it, still exists in India, and has been thoroughly criticised. Government policies aim at reducing this inequality by reservation, quota for backward classes, but paradoxically also <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> incentive to keep this stratification alive. The Indian government officially recognises historically discriminated communities of India such as the Untouchables under the designation of Scheduled Castes, and certain economically backward castes as Other Backward Class.|$|E

25|$|In philosophy, Leibniz is most {{noted for}} his optimism, i.e. his {{conclusion}} that our Universe is, in a restricted sense, {{the best possible}} one that God could <b>have</b> <b>created,</b> <b>an</b> idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, {{was one of the}} three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.|$|E
25|$|Because of AAV's {{specialized}} {{gene therapy}} advantages, researchers <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> altered version of AAV termed self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and must wait for its second strand to be synthesized, scAAV packages two shorter strands that are complementary to each other. By avoiding second-strand synthesis, scAAV can express more quickly, although as a caveat, scAAV can only encode {{half of the}} already limited capacity of AAV. Recent reports suggest that scAAV vectors are more immunogenic than single stranded adenovirus vectors, inducing a stronger activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|Haiti also {{suffers from}} severe {{environmental}} degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, {{and in many}} places the soil has eroded {{right down to the}} bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians <b>have</b> <b>created</b> <b>an</b> illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.|$|E
