South Africa is no exception and the role of internal auditing in the South African public sector has come to the fore in recent years. This article considers the extent to which the elements and key process areas identified by the Institute of Internal Auditors' <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> model are addressed by applicable South African public sector legislation and guidance. The <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> model comprises a comprehensive international guide to assist any public organisation's internal audit function to measure its capability in terms of the Institute of Internal Auditors' six elements of internal auditing. A literature review was conducted to consider the inclusion of the key process areas within the six elements of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> model to the most prominent applicable South African legislation and guidance. The results of this research may assist the South African government to identify the significant shortcomings in legislation and guidance as it relates to internal auditing. The study, as presented in this article, found that although most of the elements of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> model are addressed to some extent by South African legislation and guidance, significant shortcomings still exist, especially on the higher capability levels of the model...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{auditing}} is {{an essential}} part of governance and can be a valuable asset to public sector institutions. However, for public sector internal auditing to effectively support management, the internal audit function (IAF) should be capable. The question arises as to how the capability of public sector IAFs can be measured. The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation published the <b>Internal</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model (IA-CM) in 2009 to provide a capability self-assessment tool for public sector IAFs. The main objective of the study is to determine whether the IA-CM can be used successfully to measure <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> levels, and a secondary objective is to determine whether the tool can be successfully adapted for a specific public sector organisation and/or country. To achieve these objectives, the model was applied in a South African public sector organisation by means of a case study, where the IAF of the case was ranked against the key process areas (KPAs) of the model. The ranking was conducted based on a documentary review and interviews with applicable officials within the case. The model was successfully tested in measuring the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> level of a South African public sector organisation; however, a total of eight potential feasibility hindrances or considerations have been identified that could negatively affect the implementation of seven of the KPAs of the IA-CM.

40|$|The South African {{public sector}} faces {{significant}} challenges that impact on {{its ability to}} deliver services to the public. There are several parties that can assist the public sector in addressing these challenges. One of these is the internal audit functions of government organisations. For internal auditing to support effectively the managements of the government organisations they serve, the internal audit function should be sufficiently capable. The questions remain as to whether South African public sector internal audit functions are sufficiently capable and how <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> can be measured. The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation published the <b>Internal</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model (IA-CM) in 2009. The main purpose of the model is to provide a capability self-assessment tool for public sector internal audit functions. This model {{could be used as a}} yardstick in measuring public sector <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> within South Africa, should the elements and key process areas (KPAs) of the model be applicable to the South African context. This study therefore aims to determine whether the IA-CM can be applied within a South African context. The South African public sector, the role of internal auditing within the South African public sector as well as the IA-CM as a tool of measuring public sector <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> were investigated. A literature review was conducted on these topics, as a foundation for the study. Specific data was obtained on each of the KPAs of the IA-CM through a case study design by selecting an appropriate South African national department and ranking the case against the KPAs of the IA-CM. The ranking was conducted based on a review of relevant documents and interviews with applicable internal audit and management staff and audit committee members of the selected case. The study concludes that 82. 9 % of the KPAs of the IA-CM appear to be applicable within a South African context and that, in essence, the model can be applied within a South African context. However, eight hindrances that may negatively affect the feasibility of implementing the remaining 17. 1 % of the KPAs or certain components of these KPA’s, have been also been identified.

40|$|Internal {{auditing}} {{has been}} called upon to enhance its value proposition for organisations and one way of doing this is to demonstrate its effectiveness. By using the responses of participants from the BRICS countries on the 2010 global Common Body of Knowledge survey of the Institute of Internal Auditors {{in conjunction with the}} elements of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model this study examines the convergence towards internal audit effectiveness by the BRICS countries. The study uses a neo-institutional perspective to demonstrate how internal auditing in the BRICS countries has responded to coercive, normative and mimetic pressures to demonstrate effectiveness. The study shows that coercive pressures for internal auditing exist in all the BRICS countries, but owing to the voluntary internal audit structure in Russia, such pressure appears to be lower in that country. Using professionalism to demonstrate normative pressures, the emphasis on internal audit in the King III report of South Africa was evident. The results of this study seem to indicate that South Africa has responded more to mimetic pressures in relation to people management, professional practices and organisational relationships than other BRICS countries.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{managerial}} reforms in the Belgian public sector since the 1990, the internal audit function {{is viewed as a}} new managerial instrument to reinforce the reliability of an organization’s internal control system. It has spread sporadically amongst public entities. At the same time, recent research on internal auditing has shown that the professional boundaries of the internal audit continue to evolve, driven primarily by increased attention to “good governance” and the resulting regulations, codes of good governance, guidelines, and internal control standards. Bearing all this in mind, the main research question addressed here was to identify to what extent the institutional theory explained the choices of Belgian public entities to adopt IA programs and to professionalize them. The theoretical framework of this study argued that the institutional pressures are necessary but not sufficient conditions to explain IA outcomes. To complete the institutional framework of DiMaggio and Powell, an autonomy perspective of public entities has been suggested to explain IA administrative behaviour with regard to IA programs in the public context. The study examines the influence of the six conditions: the coercive pressure, the normative pressure, the managerial autonomy, the structural autonomy, the financial dependence and a strong external control environment. Their influence is examined on two phenomena: first on IA adoption; second on IA professionalization. IA professionalization is based on the maturity scale levels taken from the <b>Internal</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model (IIA, 2009); then simplified into three maturity states: unsustainable, sustainable and professional. Configurational hypotheses have been formulated combining both institutional pressures and autonomy attributes, assuming that various configurations of conditions lead to similar IA outcomes while some conditions are more powerful than others, depending on their interaction with each other. Consequently, this research design is not a single causal model but one of multiple causes. The hypotheses have been tested in the Belgian public context through a quantitative national survey from which a population of cases has been extracted. These included public entities of various autonomy scales at the same governmental level and where IA programs are managed at the entity level (excluding Flanders). A configurational analysis based on fsQCA has been conducted: first with 66 public entities at the federal, regional and local levels to test IA adoption; second, with 29 IA programs pertaining to the same population of cases to test IA professionalization. Quantitative findings have been completed by a qualitative study following a triangular approach, with 21 cases from our population of cases, to examine further the main trends and issues highlighted by the quantitative test, plus mimetism.

This study provides empirical evidence as to the main factors influencing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness can be only enhanced through its independence; there are various factors that contribute to autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. These factors are namely competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> the size of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department, the relationship between internal and external auditors, management support for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. The results suggested that management should support the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and promote <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> autonomy from political interference. This would bring effectiveness of both the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and management. In this context, literature was also reviewed whereby different views were given towards autonym of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> was defined, forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> that <b>internal</b> auditors comply with such as Financial audit, Risk management and system controls, Advisory and investigative service and Performance audit.

The sample population is 50 and it constitutes 25 from the general lower level employees, 7 from the top management, 10 from councillors, 4 from <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees and 4 from the workers committee. The research tools used were interviews and questionnaires which had both open-ended and closed questions. Sampling techniques used are purposive, stratified and simple random sampling.

The literature review discussed the evolution of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> profession {{and its impact on the}} competency requirements of internal auditors. The dimensions of workplace learning were explored. In addition, workplace learning in the accounting and auditing professions was examined globally, and in South Africa, with reference to different professional bodies competency frameworks, and the workplace learning component of these frameworks. Data were collected from focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews held in South Africa with 65 participants, including <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employers, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees, presenters and assessors of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning, and members of the IIA (SA) Education and Training Committee to determine their views on <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning.

40|$|South Africa’s {{successive}} {{corporate governance}} codes have progressively increased {{their emphasis on}} <b>internal</b> <b>auditing.</b> This article had two aims, both resulting in specific contributions to the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> literature in South Africa. Firstly, it aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of factors that could affect <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> standing, based on the references to <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in the King report on governance for South Africa 2009 (King III). Secondly, questionnaire data collected from relevant stakeholders were aligned with {{the review of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function standing obtained from King III in a comparative analysis of the standing of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> functions of national government departments. The main finding of this article is that <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in government departments lacks the standing that is envisaged in King III. Regular communication between chairpersons of audit committees (CACs), accounting officers (AOs) and the heads of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> (CAEs) of each department should clarify the role that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> functions are expected to fulfil using the resources available. The agreed role should be reflected in the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> charter of each department. The National Treasury should play a prominent role in evaluating the reasonable nature of and compliance with government departments’ <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> charters. am 201...|$|R

I am describing the process of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> on a company providing services. Particular steps of this <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> are being described in this thesis while the final report of the internal auditor is included.

The methodology includes a comparative study of 5 European countries’ public sector <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> methodologies, by carrying out a documents analysis and evaluation of the existing normative acts, analysing cases and other scientific findings of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> methodology and legislation.
