5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an <b>inducer</b> of apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhile {{luminance}} contrast helps {{determine what}} is likely to stand out as figure against ground in complex patterns, the influence of color saturation on figureground organization is unclear. We investigated the effects of saturation on figureground organization and apparent background field brightness in configurations of colored <b>inducers</b> (blue, green, yellow, or red) on achromatic backgrounds. The stimuli and psychophysical forced-choice procedures have been described previously (Dresp-Langley & Reeves, 2012). Here, we varied the saturation level (weak or strong) and the luminance contrast of the colored <b>inducers.</b> We find that strongly saturated <b>inducers,</b> regardless which color, yield significantly higher probabilities of subjective background contrast than weakly saturated <b>inducers,</b> which yield higher probabilities of background assimilation. A significant interaction between saturation and luminance contrast (Michelson) is observed. Moreover, strongly saturated <b>inducers</b> or <b>inducers</b> with a strong luminance contrast yield significantly higher probabilities to stand out as figure against the background than weakly saturated <b>inducers</b> or <b>inducers</b> with a weak luminance contrast. We found significant interactions between luminance contrast polarity and saturation levels on the depth effects. The results point towards a functional role of color saturation as a cue to figureground. [This work is supported by CNRS, PICS 05971 'QUALIA'...|$|R

40|$|An {{intriguing}} {{paradox is}} created by the phenomena of lightness contrast, in which the difference in lightness between targets and <b>inducers</b> is over-estimated, and assimilation, in which this difference is under-estimated. Inducers’ spatial frequency is an important factor: <b>inducers</b> with low-spatial frequency seem to induce contrast whilst <b>inducers</b> with highspatial frequency seem to induce assimilation. The interaction of this factor with depth is less clear. Wolff (1934) found that contrast disappears when low-spatial frequency <b>inducers</b> are non-coplanar with targets, while Soranzo at al. (2010) found that contrast persists even with high-spatial frequency <b>inducers</b> when they are non-coplanar with the targets. The {{difference between these two}} studies is that Wolff manipulated actual depth, whilst Soranzo et al. manipulated stereoscopic depth. This study manipulated the actual distance between target and <b>inducers,</b> as well as Inducers’ Spatial frequency and Intensity. Participants indicated the target lightness by choosing the correspondent chip in a Munsell scale. Results suggest that high spatial-frequency <b>inducers</b> generate assimilation effects only when they are coplanar with the targets, but contrast effects when they are non-coplanar. Low-spatial frequency <b>inducers</b> generate contrast effects both when they are coplanar and at distance. We conclude that assimilation is more affected by distance than contrast...|$|R

40|$|The {{heat shock}} protein (Hsp) {{response}} is induced by heat shock and a large variety of different chemicals. Searching for a common denominator of these different <b>inducers,</b> we and others developed the notion that all <b>inducers</b> may generate abnormally folded, i. e. non-native, proteins, and that such non-native proteins may trigger the Hsp response. Experimentation prompted by this notion resulted, for example, in the demonstration that chemically denatured proteins, introduced in cells by microinjection, can activate the response. Based on the chemical nature of <b>inducers</b> and on results reported from several studies, we hypothesized that <b>inducers</b> of the Hsp response may be generally capable of triggering oxidation of non-protein thiols, particularly glutathione. Such oxidation is known to lead to formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and protein-protein disulfides. Presumably, thiol adduction and cross-linking would affect the structure of proteins involved, resulting in unfolding of a fraction of these proteins, causing heat shock factor (Hsf) activation. To test the feasibility of this hypothesis, thirteen different <b>inducers</b> were selected, and it was shown that all chemical <b>inducers</b> as well as heat shock cause drastic oxidation of glutathione under conditions under which they induce HSE DNA-binding activity. Under the same conditions, all chemical <b>inducers</b> and heat shock also cause trimerization of Hsf 1. For several <b>inducers,</b> it was also shown that they enhance thiol oxidation of proteins. Finally, in vitro experiments {{support the notion that}} activation of Hsf 1 does not require oxidation of the factor itself or of its coregulators.

25|$|Primidone, carbamazepine, {{phenobarbital}} and phenytoin {{are among}} the most potent hepatic enzyme inducing drugs in existence. This enzyme induction occurs at therapeutic doses.

40|$|A {{number of}} genes that are induced by type‐I interferons are also {{activated}} {{by one or}} more other <b>inducers,</b> including double‐stranded RNA, viruses, interferon‐γ, interleukin‐ 1 and tumor necrosis factor. However, these <b>inducers</b> can also activate the expression of type‐I interferons. Thus, the activation of type‐I interferon‐inducible genes by these other <b>inducers</b> could be direct, or a secondary consequence of the induction of interferon. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have used cell lines lacking all type‐I interferon genes to study the direct effect of potential <b>inducers</b> on the expression of 14 interferon‐inducible human genes. We show that double‐stranded RNA, virus, interferon‐γ or tumor necrosis factor‐α can act directly to induce specific subsets of type‐I interferoninducible genes {{in the absence of any}} possible type‐I interferon involvement. The cis‐acting element which confers inducibility by type‐I interferon has been shown in some cases to confer inducibility by interferon‐γ, double‐stranded RNA or virus as well. However, not all promoters containing such an element respond to both interferon and other <b>inducers.</b> Thus, the ability of a given gene to respond to different <b>inducers</b> most likely depends on the exact nature and specific combination of cis‐acting elements present in its promoter.

Using event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} we examined the time courses of neural activations provoked by shapes defined by (1) lines, (2) illusory contour <b>inducers,</b> and (3) reversed <b>inducers.</b> SPM 99 was used to analyze the common and differential neural responses associated with the stimuli and their temporal derivatives. Illusory figures versus reversed <b>inducers</b> activated extrastriate cortex. Reversed <b>inducers</b> versus illusory figures activated the right parietal cortex. For both illusory and line contours versus reversed <b>inducers,</b> analysis of the temporal derivatives showed earlier activations in extrastriate and left parietal cortex and for line contours also in the extrastriate cortex bilaterally and in the right parietal cortex; these earlier activations were mirrored by differences in reaction times with subjects responding more slowly to shapes defined by reversed <b>inducers.</b> The results show substantial bottom-up effects (in occipital cortex) in the recognition of illusory and explicit shapes. By contrast, in stimuli where the shape must be inferred, there is greater reliance on right parietal cortex, consistent with increased attentional demands and top-down processing. The temporal derivatives provide useful information on the differential timing of the associated hemodynamic responses in occipital, parietal, and motor cortex. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).
