For several decades it has been the home of India's main financial services, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment. <b>From</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry.|$|E

5|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj {{is seen to}} have {{a spiritual}} merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
