40|$|The {{feasibility}} of incorporating an onboard battery charger into the inverter previously developed under a NASA contract is successfully demonstrated. The {{rated output power}} of the resulting <b>isolated</b> <b>battery</b> charger is 3. 6 kW at 220 Vac with an 86 percent efficiency and a 95 percent power factor. Also achieved are improved inverter efficiency (from 90 to 93 percent at 15 kW motor shaft power), inverter peak power capability (from 26 to 34 kW), and reduced weight and volume of the combined inverter/charger package (47 kg, 49 x 44 x 24 cm). Some major conclusions are that using the inverter commutation circuitry to perform the battery charging function is advantageous, and that the input-commutated thyristor inverter {{has the potential to}} be an excellent inverter and battery charger for use in electric vehicle applications...|$|E
40|$|Plug-in vehicles, {{electric}} vehicles or plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}}, use grid power {{to charge the}} battery. The components in the traction circuit, like the electric motor and the inverter, are not used during the battery charging, {{so there is a}} possibility to use them in the charger circuit to reduce the size, weight and price of the on-board charger; that is called an integrated motor drive and battery charger or simply an integrated charger which can be galvanically isolated or non-isolated from the utility grid. Different examples of integrated chargers reported by academia or industry, isolated or non-isolated, are reviewed and compared in terms of circuit configuration, control strategy, degree of integration, and efficiency. Moreover some new isolated and non-isolated solutions are presented and explained. A patented integrated motor drive and <b>isolated</b> <b>battery</b> charger based on a split-phase permanent magnet (PM) motor is described where the motor windings are reconfigured for the traction and charging mode by using a relay-based switching device. To reduce the magnetization current due to the motor airgap, the motor rotates at synchronous speed during the battery charging. So, an extra clutch is used in the system to disconnect the motor from the vehicle transmission during the charge operation. The mathematical model of the split-phase PM motor based on a double $dq$ approach, the developed controllers, and the system functionality are explained. Moreover, simulation and experimental results show that the system has a good performance in terms of system efficiency and dynamic response with two PM motor alternatives in two separate practical systems. Two new categories of integrated motor drives and non-isolated battery chargers are presented and explained. The first scheme is based on the winding's reconfiguration of a split-phase PM motor which simulation and practical results are provided. The second scheme is a single-phase solution that a split-phase PM motor and two inverters enable battery charging. Based on the double $dq$ model of the split-phase PM motor that provides the theoretical framework, a modal filed-oriented controller is proposed for a drive system that utilizes two identical inverters and a split-phase PM motor. A decoupling strategy is proposed based on the eigenvalue decomposition to impart a systematic methodology for the current controllers design. Moreover, a maximum torque per ampere strategy is derived to reach an optimal torque development in the drive system. Simulation results are provided to show the system performance in the steady-state and dynamic for a speed control system. For a reference speed profile, the drive system has a fast speed response while the torque and currents are tracking the optimal trajectories...|$|E

50|$|Parallel configuration: If {{the goal}} is to {{increase}} capacity and prolong the runtime of the inverter, batteries can be connected in parallel. This increases the overall ampere-hour (Ah) rating of the battery set. If a single battery is discharged though, the other batteries will then discharge through it.

To avoid this, large paralleled batteries may be connected via diodes or intelligent monitoring with automatic switching to <b>isolate</b> an under-voltage <b>battery</b> from the others.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 95 - 99. The aim of {{this project}} was to characterise an early histone gene <b>battery</b> <b>isolated</b> from Parenchinus angulosus. An early histone gene battery (named H 27) which was {{believed}} to have been isolated from Parenchinus angulosus, appeared by restriction enzyme mapping and partial sequencing to be identical to H 22, an early histone gene <b>battery</b> <b>isolated</b> from Psammechinus miliaris. (This latter gene was obtained from M. Birnstiel.) This was further confirmed by electron microscopy, and proved to be a convenient testing ground for the electron microscopic techniques of denaturation mapping and heteroduplex anlysis. Another gene battery (named SU 1) isolated fromParenchinus angulosus, was then characterised using the techniques developed whilst studying H 27. The restriction enzyme map of this clone is different to that of H 22, indicating that differences do indeed exist between these two early histone gene batteries. SU 1 also showed the expected order of the five histone genes, as determined by hybridization against the coding regions of H 22. The denaturation map of SU 1 showed AT rich spacer regions and GC rich coding regions. Heteroduplex analysis indicated that the spacer regions between the Hl and H 2 A, the H 2 A and H 3, and the H 3 and the H 2 B gene coding areas are essentially nonhomologous. The H 4 structural gene and corresponding spacer regions were not included in this analysis. Because it is known that all the five histones are coded for on the same strand of DNA in H 22, and that each of the genes is transcribed in the same direction, it follows that, the same holds for, at least, the Hl, H 2 A, H 3 and H 2 B genes of SU 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{successful}} {{in the implementation of}} wind turbines depends on several factors, including: the wind resource at the installation site, the equipment used, project acquisition and operational costs. In this paper, the production of electricity from two small wind turbines was compared through simulation using the computer software HOMER - a national model of 6 kW and an imported one of 5 kW. The wind resources in three different cities were considered: Campinas (SP/BR), Cubatão (São Paulo/BR) and Roscoe (Texas/ USA). A wind power system connected to the grid and a wind <b>isolated</b> system - <b>batteries</b> were evaluated. The results showed that the energy cost ($/kWh) is strongly dependent on the windmill characteristics and local wind resource.

General Simmons recommended that the old Knights’ entrenchments located along the line of the escarpment at Tarġa and Naxxar were to be restored and incorporated into the defences. He also recommended that good communication roads should be formed {{in the rear of the}} lines and that those that already existed be improved.

This study evaluated Mannitol salt agar and the deoxyribonuclease (DNase) test for improving {{the efficiency of the}} tube coagulase test in resource limited settings. The efficiency of human and sheep plasma with tube coagulase tests was also evaluated. Methods: One hundred and eighty Gram positive, Catalase positive cocci occurring in pairs, short chains or clusters were subjected to growth on Mannitol salt agar, deoxyribonuclease and tube coagulase tests. Of these, isolates that were positive for {{at least two of the}} three tests (n = 60) were used to evaluate the performance of the tube coagulase test for {{identification of}} S. aureus, using PCR-amplification of the nuc gene as a gold standard.

40|$|Citrobacter rodentium (formerly Citrobacter freundii biotype 4280 and Citrobacter genomospecies 9) was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} biochemical characterization and DNA-DNA hybridization data and is the only Citrobacter species known to possess virulence factors homologous to those of the human pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. These virulence factors are encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island required for the characteristic attaching and effacing (AE) pathology seen in infection with these three pathogens. C. rodentium, which apparently infects only mice, provides a useful animal model for studying the molecular basis of AE pathology. No work has been done to assess differences in pathogenicity between C. rodentium isolates from diverse sources. Here, we report the examination of 15 C. rodentium <b>isolates</b> using a <b>battery</b> of genetic and biochemical approaches. No differences were observed between the isolates by repetitive-element sequence-based PCR analysis, biochemical analysis, and possession of LEE-specific virulence factors. These data suggest that members of the species are clonal. We further characterized an atypical E. coli strain from Japan called mouse-pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) that, in our hands, caused the same disease as C. rodentium. Applying the same battery of tests, we found that MPEC possesses LEE-encoded virulence factors and is indistinguishable from the previously characterized C. rodentium isolate DBS 100. These results demonstrate that MPEC is a misclassified C. rodentium isolate and that members of this species are clonal and represent the only known attaching and effacing bacterial pathogen of mice...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a rapid and simple novel phenotypic assay for drug susceptibility of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type- 1 (HIV- 1) using a CCR 5 -expressing HeLa/CD 4 + cell clone 1 - 10 (MAGIC- 5). MAGIC- 5 cells produced large amounts of HIV- 1 in culture supernatants, which enabled us to perform the phenotypic resistance assay. Determination of HIV- 1 susceptibility to various protease inhibitors (PI) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was completed within 15 days in T-cell-tropic (X 4) and macrophage-tropic (R 5) viruses using fresh plasma samples containing at least 104 copies/ml. The nucleotide sequence of the envelope V 3 region of HIV- 1 in plasma was almost identical {{to that of the}} virus isolated by MAGIC- 5 cells, suggesting a lack of selection bias in our assay. The assay variability was confined to within five-fold in all drugs examined. Accordingly, we used a 10 -fold increase in the 50 % inhibitory concentration as the cutoff value for viral resistance in the present assay. HIV- 1 resistant to lamivudine, which was not detected by conventional genotypic assays, was isolated. In HIV- 1 with PI-associated primary amino acid substitutions, our assay showed that drug resistance profiles correlated well with previously reported genotypic-assay data. Furthermore, our assay provided comprehensive results regarding PI resistance in the presence of multiple mutations. The novel assay successfully quantified the level of resistance of clinical HIV- 1 <b>isolates</b> to a <b>battery</b> of anti-HIV drugs, indicating its clinical usefulness, particularly in patients who failed to respond to antiretroviral chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{designer}} of the battery monitoring system faces {{the difficult task of}} choosing the technology that will allow the extraction of information for the state of health of the battery while the battery is online. For the purpose of assessing the battery internal ohmic value, some battery monitoring manufacturers inject AC signals in to the battery strings, while others periodically apply a load pulse. Unfortunately, those signals are not always welcomed by the battery user or battery manufacturer. The authors will present a passive method to measure and pinpoint a suspicious cell and extract battery performance information without injecting any signals to the battery by using the normally unwelcomed signals produced by charger/UPS equipment. Any AC power converter using the battery for the backup power source does inversely introduce the AC signals (often referred as the ripple and noises) across the DC link. The amplitude and frequency of these signals vary with UPS architecture. The authors will classify the source and properties of such signals in standby, on-line, 12 -step, and PWM power conversion, with <b>isolated</b> and nonisolated <b>battery</b> placement. The information should show performance down to individual cells without injecting any external signals to the battery link. The possibility of using the existing signals, in the form of ripple or white noise, will be discussed; however, AC signals across a battery are usually in low or very low amplitude; therefore a special noise elimination technique must be applied. The concept of an instrument capable of measuring the signal below noise level, the technical obstacles, and results of the online test will be presented and discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} of Staphylococcus aureus in human and veterinary medicine {{is a serious}} worldwide problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in commercial broiler chickens as well as to establish antimicrobial susceptibility and the distribution of genetic determinants conferring resistance and virulence. One hundred and ninety-four samples were aseptically collected from broiler chicken slaughterhouses and retail outlets around the Durban metropolitan area in South Africa. Microbiological and molecular methods were used to detect the presence of S. aureus as well as its resistance- and virulence-associated genes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the presence of S. aureus by amplifying the nuc gene. Approximately 54 % of 194 samples were positive for S. aureus. The disc diffusion technique was used to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the S. aureus <b>isolates</b> to a <b>battery</b> of 10 antimicrobial agents, namely ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and trimethoprim. The results demonstrated that S. aureus isolates of abattoir origin had a high level (79. 4 %) of resistance to tetracycline, followed by ampicillin, vancomycin, cefoxitin, trimethoprim, erythromycin and streptomycin with resistance rates of 65. 1 %, 61. 9 %, 60. 3 %, 58. 7 %, 57. 1 % and 46. 0 %, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates of retail origin exhibited higher antimicrobial resistance prevalence rates than those of abattoir origin. Tetracycline had the highest resistance rate (100 %), followed by cefoxitin (91. 7 %), erythromycin (83. 3 %), streptomycin (83. 3 %) and kanamycin (66. 7 %). All isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. Out of the four virulence genes that were screened, only two were detected (coagulase and protein A); however, their prevalence rates were very low.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 36) The California State University of Northridge CubeSat, code named CSUNSat, {{will test}} a new low-temperature capable, battery/ultra capacitor power {{system with a}} low voltage/low power spacecraft bus. The spacecraft bus ranges from 3 V to 4. 2 V with a max power of 5 W. The requirements demanded a custom power system design with two <b>isolated</b> but switchable <b>battery</b> sources; the low temp battery, and an industry standard lithium ion battery. A simplistic topology is desired to minimize cost, area, and risk of design problems. The spacecraft uses an unregulated direct energy transfer (DET) system with a shunt regulated bus. The power system is comprised of three sub-systems; the Shunt Regulator, Battery Controller, and Power Processing Unit. The Shunt Regulator shunts the excess energy of the spacecraft bus to prevent the bus voltage from exceeding the maximum voltage specification of either battery. The Battery Controller controls the switching between the two batteries. And the Power Processing Unit provides regulated 3. 3 V, 5 V, and 12 V supplies for the spacecraft. The power supplies are low voltage switch mode DCDC converters and include the SEPIC for the 3. 3 V and 5 V supplies and a BOOST for the 12 V supply. Theses topologies have been designed and prototyped to yield an overall system efficiency of 87 % across the input voltage range for the CSUNSat at 5 W. With such a high efficiency, thermal management {{of the system is}} minimized. Only a 10 ??C thermal rise was measured with an IR camera.
