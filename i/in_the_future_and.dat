5|$|After {{the release}} of Magnolia, Anderson stated {{that he would like}} to work with comedic actor Adam Sandler <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> that he was {{determined}} to make his next film a comparatively shorter length of just 90 minutes. The resulting feature was the romantic comedy-drama film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), starring Sandler, with Emily Watson portraying his love interest. The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner (Sandler) with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters. A subplot in the film was partly based on David Phillips (also called The Pudding Guy). Sandler received critical praise for his role in his first major departure from the mainstream comedies that had made him a star. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.|$|E

He still works behind the scenes for his party, occasionally commenting on issues in the national media. He did not rule out a return to national politics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>and</b> in late 2008 he was selected by his party as the top candidate on the party's ticket in Akershus county.

5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E

5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. Until the freeway is complete, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>and</b> the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) is {{organizing}} {{the making of}} a time capsule, meant to be opened 50 years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> filled with items that encapsulate the spirit of Pawnee. A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he ever gets past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E
