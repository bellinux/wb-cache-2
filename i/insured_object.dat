The results and discussion of the data obtained that report received and forwarded to police investigators Sub Directorate Reskrimsus I Indagsi (Industry, Trade and Investment) Bengkulu Police, followed up in the investigation based on the lessee's statement of material losses in terms of money on insurance claims incurred PT Son Jasarharja Bengkulu. In this case the unlawful act committed party lessor PT Mandiri Tunas Finance in the implementation of the insurance agreement that has not been registered fiduciary against a vehicle leasing object in it and also to the lease agreement. Conclusion on this issue (1) that the agreement is carried out by PT Mandiri Tunas Finance lessor to the lessee is legally flawed. Because the lease agreement has not been registered and <b>insured</b> <b>object</b> fiduciary, in this case the investigator may conduct an investigation in this case the alleged right violated Law No. 42 of 1999 on Fiduciary and / or 372 of the Criminal Code of embezzlement.

Insurers make exceptions in coverage of excessive claims. Property, health and lives are excluded from protection of commercial insurance products. In order to look for an effective solution of uninsurable risk we have focused our interest in uninsurable risk of flood, which is significant non-life insurance risk in the Czech Republic. Main aim is to describe multi-sourcing system based on cooperation between the state, insurers and <b>insured</b> <b>objects.</b> The system {{as a result of}} the research includes features of foreign approaches to uninsurable flood risk and is adjusted according to specific conditions of the Czech insurance market.

40|$|Accidental {{damage is}} a typical {{component}} of motor insurance claim. Modeling of this nature generally involves analysis of past claim history and different characteristics of the <b>insured</b> <b>objects</b> and the policyholders. Generalized linear models (GLMs) have become the industry's standard approach for pricing and modeling risks of this nature. However, the GLM approach utilizes a single "best" model on which loss predictions are based, which ignores the uncertainty among the competing models and variable selection. An additional characteristic of motor insurance data sets {{is the presence of}} many categorical variables, within which the number of levels is high. In particular, not all levels of such variables may be statistically significant and rather some subsets of the levels may be merged to give a smaller overall number of levels for improved model parsimony and interpretability. A method is proposed for assessing the optimal manner in which to collapse a factor with many levels into one with a smaller number of levels, then Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used to blend model predictions from all reasonable models to account for factor collapsing uncertainty. This method will be computationally intensive due to the number of factors being collapsed as well as the possibly large number of levels within factors. Hence a stochastic optimisation is proposed to quickly find the best collapsing cases across the model space...|$|R

The approach presented here brings a solution to manage the diversity and the complexity of 3 D data in a Geographical Information System. Our approach is not to use one unique model but 2 levels of modeling in order to describe the whole 3 D scene. The first level uses a 3 D topology composed of nodes, edges, and faces. A volume is defined by its shell. This model <b>insures</b> <b>object’s</b> consistency. Each object is composed of constructive structure, e. g. a house is a set of three constructive structure which are the roof, the wall and the floor. Each constructive structure is made of structural primitives. Several components of one object or several objects could share the same topological primitive. networks. Road network is an example of physical networks in which road sections are classed as arc and crossroad or buildings are classed as node. Abstract networks allow creating a link between objects, which are possibly physically independent ones from the other. Buildings sharing the same Intranet network could illustrate those “abstract networks”. This level is very useful to support queries on classical networks or to materialize dependencies between objects. Computation of optimal path on graph is also related with this level of structuring...|$|R

These gain modulations are thought to support a mechanism involved in the spatial localization of objects. In the present study, we show that part of them may reflect an additional function: enhancing the visual processing of the objects located straight ahead. Using single- and multiunit recordings in behaving macaques, we found that in peripheral V 1, the gain of most neurons increases as their receptive fields (RF) are brought closer to the straight-ahead direction by changing the direction of gaze. No such tendency was observed in central V 1, although the influence of gaze direction is similar in term of strength. This previously unknown organization of the gaze-related gain modulations might <b>insure</b> that <b>objects</b> located straight ahead still receive a privileged processing during eccentric fixation, reflecting the ecological importance of this particular egocentric direction...|$|R

One of them is commerce of equipment of transportation namely the many motor vehicles imported merchant and in Indonesia. This vehicle commerce business hardly {{to the advantage of}} investor playing at in this business, in execution of commerce using transportation media to earn is just happened things/risks/event undesirable dicey by the owner of vehicles. Dicey event of that is for example vehicle theft, vehicle damage caused by accident, fire, natural disaster (earthquake, floods, mount erupts, tsunami), riot and others. One of way done by owner of motor vehicle to transfer all the risks is by the way of transferring risk to party giving security and safety guarantee or compensatory to itself vehicle. In this case, the guarantor is the side of insurance. The many emulations of effort for insurance service giver the party’s insurance races give a real guarantee promises. Insurance product which now hardly enthused by the insurance service users be releasing the extension of guarantee to all risks which possibly will befall the vehicle. The famous product by the name of insurance All Risk, is insurance giving all risks to small risk (for example breakdown mirror, destruction of body car and others) and risk that is weight (breakdown car because collision, or stolen by people) as well as responsibility to third party. Financial loss to vehicle experiencing accident, theft and responsibility to other party harmed by vehicle of itself is heavy burden for the owner, which {{might not be able to}} be shouldered self. Therefore, now the insurance service users can choose insurance company thinking it precise to insure the vehicle. Purpose of this research is to know about execution procedure of payment of insurance claim All Risk by underwriter to the insured in PT. Asuransi Jiwa Bersama Bumi Putera (AJB BP). Besides, to know protection of law what given to the <b>insured</b> if <b>object</b> <b>insured</b> with All Risk to experience evenemen, and law responsibility what given by underwriter if <b>object</b> <b>insured</b> by All Risk to entangle third party. Research method applied is yuridist sociologies, that is explains facts obtained from result of research in field and or through documentation and bibliography study then for pulled conclusion. Based on result of research is got result as follows. That execution of execution of agreement of insurance All Risk to motor vehicle in PT. AJB BP divided to become three steps. Firstly is field officer from insurance visits client candidate and surveys vehicle which will be insured. Second, that is field officer offers product released by company and additional guarantees and liability insurance closing type. Third is accomplishment of condition of agreement where agreement of motor vehicle insurance can happen after agreement between both parties that is underwriter and the insured. While replacement mechanism/payment insurance claims All Risk the side of insurance gives two options, that is payment of claim and rejection of claim. Then from protection side of law to the insured and third party becoming victim which caused by <b>object</b> <b>insured</b> with All Risk. Firstly, protection of law given by underwriter to clause owner the insured All Risk hence protection to the insured is the absolute existence. Second is protection of law given by the side of insurance entangling third party, hence the side of PT. AJB BP will pay attention to authenticity from policy applied and concordance in clause found on policy All Risk.

60|$|These reasons {{make the}} word Progress as unapt as the terms Order and Permanence {{to become the}} basis for a {{classification}} of the requisites of a form of government. The fundamental antithesis which these words express does not lie in the things themselves, so much as in the types of human character which answer to them. There are, we know, some minds in which caution, and others in which boldness, predominates; in some, the desire to avoid imperilling what is already possessed is a stronger sentiment than that which prompts to improve the old and acquire new advantages; while there are others who lean the contrary way, and are more eager for future than careful of present good. The road to the ends of both is the same; but they are liable to wander from it in opposite directions. This consideration is of importance in composing the personnel of any political body: persons of both types ought to be included in it, that the tendencies of each may be tempered, in so far as they are excessive, by a due proportion of the other. There needs no express provision to <b>insure</b> this <b>object,</b> provided care is taken to admit nothing inconsistent with it. The natural and spontaneous admixture of the old and the young, of those whose position and reputation are made and those who have them still to make, will in general sufficiently answer the purpose, if only this natural balance is not disturbed by artificial regulation.|$|R

5000|$|Once the 1833 Act was passed, the {{evidence}} taken by Sadler of practices in unregulated mills was strictly speaking irrelevant to any further factory legislation. In 1836, another Ten Hours' Bill was mooted. The Blackburn Standard - a Conservative paper {{published in a}} Lancashire milltown - declared its support (and hence implicitly a view that the Factory Commission recommendations had not gone far enough). However, the Standard did not base its support on Sadler's report and was scathing on about those whose arguments for the new Bill relied heavily on the more lurid evidence in Sadler's report: …However true {{it may be that}} the barbarities which it so pathetically and powerfully deplores were practised some years ago in the woollen mills of Yorkshire, they are altogether unknown in the present day in the cotton mills of Lancashire, and the operative classes of society are of course not so degraded and oppressed as insinuated.

A possible solution would involve visiting a deployment site on short notice and randomly selecting a given number of warheads for dismantlement. The warheads would then be placed in tagged, sealed containers for transport to the dismantlement facility, where the integrity of the tags and seals would be verified. If the number of warheads to be dismantled is {{a small fraction of the}} entire inventory, then the monitoring party would be reasonably sure that the warheads are genuine, for the only way the monitored party could defeat the scheme would be to deploy large numbers of fake warheads. Still, the process of on-site tagging and sealing for each warhead is tedious, and the monitored party would have no assurance that all the warheads were genuine, since the monitored party could easily replace 10 or 20 percent of the warheads slated for dismantlement with decoys. A much better solution would involve gathering only a small sample of warheads during an initial random on-site inspection and establishing a unique “fingerprint” or signature for this warhead type...|$|R

A pesquisa de metodologia qualitativa analisou {{material}} empírico composto por amostra de registros da Ouvidoria da Previdência Social contendo reclamações sobre o atendimento médico-pericial. A Previdência integra o campo da seguridade social e tem a vida e suas intercorrências na população de segurados como seu objeto de cuidados e controles. O benefício auxílio-doença é o mais frequentemente concedido entre todos os benefícios da Previdência sendo devido somente a seus segurados em dupla condição de vulnerabilidade, doentes e incapazes para o trabalho. A verificação da condição de incapacidade para o trabalho é realizada pelos médicos peritos da Previdência Social como pré-requisito para acesso ao benefício e funciona como mecanismo de controle de custos. Os resultados do estudo evidenciam que a tarefa de controle de acesso, realizada na interface com o segurado, exige um deslocamento da atividade médica da função assistencial para a pericial em decorrência da natureza da tarefa médico-pericial, onde o lugar do controle é o da exceção beneficente. Tal atribuição condiciona um risco da atividade médico-pericial que entendemos ser de ordem moral. As reclamações sobre o atendimento médico na perícia previdenciária foram compreendidas como índices de disfunções nesta interface, assim como os registros de violência em torno desta atividade. Resultantes da prática de limites de acesso ao benefício, na forma em que estes limites estão colocados. A análise desta interface coloca em relevo o paradoxo da proteção securitária que funciona retirando da proteção partes de sua população e caracteriza a relação médico-paciente na perícia médica da Previdência Social como moralmente conflituosa. A pesquisa na linha de uma bioética crítica, que enfatiza as políticas públicas que afetam a vida, entendeu Previdência Social como biopolítica e a atividade médico-pericial como expressão de biopoder, nos termos da filosofia política de Michel Foucault. Cabe à sociedade refletir seriamente sobre essas práticas de controle e definir o alcance e a forma da proteção securitária tendo em vista que esta proteção tensiona necessidades individuais e coletivas. Cabe a todos e a cada um ter em mente a dimensão ética da política previdenciária.

The qualitative methodology research analyzed empirical material composed sample records of the Ombudsman of Brazilian`s Social Security System containing complaints about the medical examinations. The Social Security System has life and its complications in the population of <b>insured</b> persons as <b>object</b> of care and controls. The sick leave benefits is the most often granted between all social security benefits being due only to its policyholders in double condition of vulnerability, disease and work disability. The verification of incapacity to work is carried out by medical experts of Social Security as prerequisite for access to benefit {{and serves as a}} cost-control mechanism. The results of the study show that the task of access control, held at the interface with insured, requires an offset of medical care function {{as a result of the}} nature of medical-legal examinations, where place of the control is the beneficent exception. Such attributions determine a specific risk to the medical-legal examinations that we understand to be of moral order. The complaints about the medical work in Social Security were understood as dysfunctions index on this interface, as well as the records of violence around this activity. As results of the limits to access the benefits, in the form in which of these limits are placed. The analysis of this interface puts into sharp relief the paradox of social security protection that works by removing parts of its population under protection and characterizes the medicalpatient relationship in Medical Social Security expertise as morally conflictive. The research, in accordance with a critical bioethics approach, that emphasizes the public policies that affect the life, understands Social Security as Biopolitics and medical expertise as an expression of Biopower according political philosophy of Michel Foucault. Its up to society reflect seriously on these control practice and define the scope and form of social security protection considering that this protection produces tension between individual and collective needs. Its up to each and every one to keep in mind the ethical dimension of the social security policy...|$|R
