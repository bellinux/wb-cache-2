500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's {{the kind of music}} that plants a seed in your mind {{and then you have to}} hear it several times. And as you <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Rolling Stone list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" [...] ranked [...] "Highway 61 Revisited", [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] at number373, number187, and numberone, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. It was also included in Robert Christgau's [...] "Basic Record Library" [...] of 1960s music and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structure}} of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and {{there was even a}} text book entitled ALM [...] ) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was [...] "pattern practice," [...] which were drills expecting [...] "automatic" [...] responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as [...] "mimicry-memorization." [...] 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. [...] 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{course he}} could not get the {{materials}} for his lengthy discourses [...] "all out of his own head" [...] but he knew whence there was a perfect mine of such matter, and thence he provided himself with supplies. He brought into the House from the Library bundles of parliamentary papers and Blue Books, and from these he proceeded to read copious extracts. Once when he had been at his work for more than two hours, without a pause – except to take an occasional sip of water – the chairman (the House being in Committee), thought to get him to resume his seat by telling him that his observations had become almost inaudible and unintelligible to the chair. Mr. Biggar tendered respectful apologies, said he felt conscious that his voice was growing somewhat indistinct, remarked that he was at rather too great a distance from the chair, but said he would be happy to improve matters by drawing nearer. Thereupon he gathered up his books and papers and moved up, with all the ease and confidence in the world, to the front bench on the opposition side, facing the table of the house – a place reserved by immemorial custom for ex-ministers and their leading supporters. Then, before resuming the thread, or rather the chain-cable- of his discourse, he informed the astonished functionary that if there was any part of his argument which had not reached his ears, he was quite willing to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E

60|$|That is {{the plan}} he always pursued himself. The list made, he would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> carefully, as he always advised, {{to see that he}} had {{forgotten}} nothing.
