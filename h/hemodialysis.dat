5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of <b>hemodialysis.</b> <b>Hemodialysis</b> is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. <b>Hemodialysis</b> also has the added benefit of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. <b>Hemodialysis</b> is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and <b>hemodialysis</b> are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because <b>hemodialysis</b> will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If <b>hemodialysis</b> is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with sodium bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard <b>hemodialysis</b> or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing <b>hemodialysis,</b> and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|Early {{treatment}} {{increases the}} chance of a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. <b>Hemodialysis</b> may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need <b>hemodialysis</b> {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a kidney transplant is found {{for a patient}} on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: <b>hemodialysis,</b> continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. <b>Hemodialysis,</b> which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as <b>hemodialysis,</b> hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. <b>Hemodialysis</b> and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo <b>hemodialysis,</b> there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through <b>hemodialysis</b> as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on <b>hemodialysis.</b> Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring <b>hemodialysis,</b> care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including <b>hemodialysis</b> may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. <b>Hemodialysis</b> can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|Home <b>hemodialysis</b> (HHD), is the {{provision}} of <b>hemodialysis</b> to purify the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally, in their own home.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy, such as with <b>hemodialysis,</b> may be instituted in {{some cases}} of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic {{review of the literature}} in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of intermittent <b>hemodialysis</b> and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) (a type of continuous <b>hemodialysis).</b> Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent <b>hemodialysis.</b> However, other studies demonstrated that compared with IRRT, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis.|$|E
25|$|Two {{modalities}} of dialysis {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of ADPKD patients: peritoneal dialysis and <b>hemodialysis.</b> Epidemiological data shows that ADPKD affects 5-13.4% of patients undergoing <b>hemodialysis</b> in Europe and in the United States, and about 3% in Japan. Peritoneal dialysis has usually been contra-indicated in ADPKD patients with large kidney and liver volumes, due to expected physical difficulties in the procedure and possible complications; however, recent studies suggest there is no difference in long term morbidity between <b>hemodialysis</b> and peritoneal dialysis in ADPKD.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, Kt/V is {{a number}} used to {{quantify}} <b>hemodialysis</b> and peritoneal dialysis treatment adequacy.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and their}} severities are unknown, because {{flucytosine}} is used under close medical supervision, but {{expected to be}} an excess of the usually encountered side effects on the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney function. Vigorous hydration and <b>hemodialysis</b> may be helpful in removing the drug from the body. <b>Hemodialysis</b> is particular useful in patients with impaired renal function.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic ghrelin {{administration}} for cachexia of any cause and for <b>hemodialysis</b> patients is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Hemodialysis: <b>Hemodialysis</b> {{will not}} {{significantly}} alter drug levels or change clinical effect of atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of mild {{caffeine}} intoxication {{is directed}} toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, <b>hemodialysis,</b> or hemofiltration.|$|E
25|$|Short daily home <b>hemodialysis</b> (SDHHD) - done five {{to seven}} {{times a week for}} two to four hours per session.|$|E
25|$|While renal {{replacement}} therapies {{can maintain}} people indefinitely and prolong life, {{the quality of}} life is negatively affected. Kidney transplantation increases the survival of people with stage 5 CKD when compared to other options; however, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. Transplantation aside, high-intensity home <b>hemodialysis</b> appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life, when compared to the conventional three-times-a-week <b>hemodialysis</b> and peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal home <b>hemodialysis</b> (NHHD) - done {{three to}} seven {{times per week}} at night during sleep, for six to ten hours.|$|E
25|$|Patient has {{a mass of}} 70kg (154lb) {{and gets}} a <b>hemodialysis</b> {{treatment}} that lasts 4 hours where the urea clearance is 215 ml/min.|$|E
25|$|The 7/3 is used {{to adjust}} the Kt/V value {{so it can be}} {{compared}} to the Kt/V for <b>hemodialysis,</b> which is typically done thrice weekly in the USA.|$|E
25|$|Frequent nocturnal <b>hemodialysis</b> {{can improve}} left {{ventricular}} mass measures, {{reduce the need}} for blood pressure medications, improve some measures of mineral metabolism, and improve selected measures of quality of life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of an acute overdosage, {{authorities}} recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by <b>hemodialysis</b> or peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
25|$|Training {{is usually}} done during {{business}} hours, {{as often as}} five times a week. Training can take from 2 to 8 weeks at which time one is dialyzed incenter, often in a separate home <b>hemodialysis</b> training unit.|$|E
25|$|He died in {{his city}} of birth, Marília, on October 1, 2007, due to heart and {{respiratory}} failure, caused by long-standing kidney problems which forced him to have frequent <b>hemodialysis</b> {{in the last years}} of his life.|$|E
25|$|Severe cases require <b>hemodialysis</b> or hemofiltration, {{which are}} the most rapid methods of {{removing}} potassium from the body. These are typically used if the underlying cause cannot be corrected swiftly while temporizing measures are instituted or there is no response to these measures.|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} {{elimination of the}} poison can be enhanced using diuresis, <b>hemodialysis,</b> hemoperfusion, hyperbaric medicine, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusion or chelation. However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{an episode}} of {{cholesterol}} emboli is generally symptomatic, i.e. it deals with the symptoms and complications but cannot reverse the phenomenon itself. In kidney failure resulting from cholesterol crystal emboli, statins (medication that reduces cholesterol levels) {{have been shown to}} halve the risk of requiring <b>hemodialysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thus an NHHD {{schedule}} {{results in}} a larger dose of <b>hemodialysis</b> per week, as do some SDHHD. More total time dialyzing, shorter periods between treatments {{and the fact that}} fluid removal speeds can be lower (thus reducing the symptoms resulting from rapid ultrafiltration), accounts for the advantages of these schedules over conventional ones.|$|E
25|$|In most {{children}} with postdiarrheal HUS, {{there is a}} good chance of spontaneous resolution, so observation in a hospital is often all that is necessary, with supportive care such as <b>hemodialysis</b> where indicated. If a diagnosis of STEC-HUS is confirmed, plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is contraindicated. However, plasmapheresis may be indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty between HUS and TTP.|$|E
