Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
