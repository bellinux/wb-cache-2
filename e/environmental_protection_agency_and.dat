5|$|After bee populations dropped 23% in {{the winter}} of 2013, the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>and</b> Department of Agriculture formed a task force to address the issue. In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. However, according to Syngenta and the F.A.O., the total number of beehives worldwide continues to grow. An insecticide produced by Syngenta was banned by the European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E
5|$|The March for Science Portland (also {{known as}} the March for Science PDX and Portland March for Science) was a protest held in Portland, Oregon. This local protest {{was part of the}} March for Science, a series of rallies and marches in Washington, D.C. and over 600 cities across the world on April 22, 2017 (Earth Day). Portland Science Advocates {{organized}} the march in support of science and to protest President Donald Trump's plan to cut funding for the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>and</b> the National Institutes of Health. Funding for the event, which cost approximately $30,000, was crowdsourced.|$|E
5|$|Dissolved {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>and</b> the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Like in Texas, a {{mosquito}} outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides {{acceptable to the}} US <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>and</b> the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners {{of the dangers of}} floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110million (2001USD, $143million 2012USD). $25million (2001USD, $32million 2012USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29million (2001USD, $1.5million 2007USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5million (2001USD, $14.3million 2012USD). $3.4million (2001USD, $4.4million 2012USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.|$|E
