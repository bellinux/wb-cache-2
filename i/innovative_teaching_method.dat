40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} an <b>innovative</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>method</b> that effectively integrates IT technology into {{teaching and learning}} process. The new method uses adaptive technique to trace learners ’ performance during and after a lecture so that the educator is able to quickly adjust course contents to suit the needs of learners. The success of the method is based on two feedback loops established between learners and educator. The in-class feedback is created by a SMS message based quiz system and the after-class feedback is realized by an Educator-to-Learner Portal, e-Learning Hub [1], which provides information on learners ’ progress after a lecture. The intelligence of e-Learning Hub greatly reduces the workload of educators when deals with large number of learners. The new method brings a new learning experience to students in a learner centered environment...|$|E

After many years of teaching a course about ceramic and composite materials in the Integrated Master in Mechanical Engineering of Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Portugal, the authors used the Bologna reformulation of the mechanical engineering course to introduce new teaching methodologies based on a project based learning methodology. One of the main innovations is a practical work that comprises the study of a recent ceramic scientific paper, using all the actual available tools, elaboration of a scientific report, work presentation and participation in a debate.
