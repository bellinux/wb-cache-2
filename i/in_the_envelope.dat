5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent carbon burning, {{it may have}} a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.|$|E

As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
50|$|But {{the problem}} {{can also be}} {{resolved}} mathematically without assuming a maximum amount. Nalebuff (1989), Christensen and Utts (1992), Falk and Konold (1992), Blachman, Christensen and Utts (1996), Nickerson and Falk (2006), pointed out that if the amounts of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>envelopes</b> have any proper probability distribution representing the player's prior beliefs about the amounts of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>envelopes,</b> then it is impossible that whatever <b>the</b> amount A=a <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>envelope</b> might be, it would be equally likely, according to these prior beliefs, that the second contains a/2 or 2a.

25|$|Batken {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} from hard-bodied ticks {{of the species}} Hyalomma plumbeum plumbeum infesting sheep {{near the town of}} Batken, Kirghizia, now in Kyrgyzstan, in 1970. It has also been found to infect mosquitoes of the species Aedes caspius Pallas and Culex hortensis Ficalbi, also in Kyrgyzstan. Its geographical range is limited to Central Asia, Transcaucasia and the area {{to the north of the}} Caspian Sea. In the laboratory it is highly pathogenic for mice, hamsters and chickens. The virion is variable in shape, with spherical and filamentous forms being observed; it has a diameter of 50–100nm. Batken is considered a DHOV subtype; the viruses have a high degree of sequence identity (90% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> glycoprotein; 96–98% in other proteins), and their antibodies crossreact.|$|E

500|$|Three {{groups of}} HIV-1 have been {{identified}} {{on the basis of}} differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> (env) region: M, N, and O. Group M is the most prevalent and is subdivided into eight subtypes (or clades), based on the whole genome, which are geographically distinct. The most prevalent are subtypes B (found mainly in North America and Europe), A and D (found mainly in Africa), and C (found mainly in Africa and Asia); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1. Coinfection with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs. Most HIV-1 research is focused on subtype B; few laboratories focus on the other subtypes. The existence of a fourth group, [...] "P", has been hypothesised based on a virus isolated in 2009. The strain is apparently derived from gorilla SIV (SIVgor), first isolated from western lowland gorillas in 2006.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{glycoprotein}} gB of herpes simplex virus type 1 (gB- 1), which buds from the inner nuclear membrane, as a model protein to study localization of membrane proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope.</b> To determine whether specific domains of gB- 1 glycoprotein are involved <b>in</b> localization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope,</b> we have used deletion mutants of gB- 1 protein as well as chimeric proteins constructed by replacing the domains of the cell surface glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus with the corresponding domains of gB. Mutant and chimeric proteins expressed in COS cells were localized by immunoelectron microscopy. A chimeric protein (gB-G) containing the ectodomain of gB and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of G did not localize <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope.</b> When <b>the</b> ectodomain of G was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gB, however, the resulting chimeric protein (G-gB) was localized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope.</b> Substitution of <b>the</b> transmembrane domain of G with the 69 hydrophobic amino acids containing the membrane anchoring domain of gB allowed the hybrid protein (G-tmgB) to be localized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope,</b> suggesting that residues 721 to 795 of gB can promote retention of proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope.</b> Deletion mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hydrophobic region further showed that a transmembrane segment of 21 hydrophobic amino acids, residues 774 to 795 of gB, was sufficient for localization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope.</b> Since wild-type gB and the mutant and chimeric proteins that were localized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclear <b>envelope</b> were also retained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endoplasmic reticulum, the membrane spanning segment of gB could also influence retention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endoplasmic reticulum.

2500|$|Some {{special-purpose}} {{tubes are}} constructed with particular gases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope.</b> For instance, voltage-regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon, helium or neon, which will ionize at predictable voltages. The thyratron is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, {{it contains a}} hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube [...] "latches" [...] into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state.|$|E

2500|$|A {{black light}} lamp emits long-wave UVA {{radiation}} and little visible light. Fluorescent {{black light lamp}}s work similarly to other fluorescent lamps, but use a phosphor on the inner tube surface which emits UVA radiation instead of visible light. Some lamps use a deep-bluish-purple Wood's glass optical filter that blocks almost all visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nanometres. Others use plain glass instead of the more expensive Wood's glass, so they appear light-blue to the eye when operating. A black light may also be formed, very inefficiently, by using a layer of Wood's glass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> for an incandescent bulb. Though cheaper than fluorescent UV lamps, only 0.1% of the input power is emitted as usable ultraviolet radiation. Mercury-vapor black lights in ratings up to 1kW with UV-emitting phosphor and an envelope of Wood's glass are used for theatrical and concert displays. Black lights are used in applications in which extraneous visible light must be minimized; mainly to observe fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances give off when exposed to UV light. [...] UVA/UVB emitting bulbs are also sold for other special purposes, such as tanning lamps and reptile-keeping.|$|E
2500|$|To prevent gases from {{compromising the}} tube's vacuum, modern tubes are {{constructed}} with [...] "getters", {{which are usually}} small, circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly, barium being the most common. While the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by RF induction heating to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited {{on the inside of}} the glass envelope, leaving a silver-colored metallic patch which continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric oxygen. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as zirconium. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus-based getters, and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short-lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters. Unlike the barium getters, the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired.|$|E
