40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} proposed a "microcanonical functional integral" {{representation of the}} <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> of the gravitational field. The phase of this real-time functional integral is determined by a "microcanonical" or Jacobi action, the extrema of which are classical solutions at fixed total energy, not at fixed total time interval as in Hamilton's action. This approach is fully general but is especially well suited to gravitating systems because for them the total energy can be fixed simply as a boundary condition on the gravitational field.

40|$|The steric and {{pressure}} effects {{associated with the}} recombination of free radicals both depend {{on the nature of}} the activated complex, and are therefore intimately related. From a consideration of the reverse process of unimolecular dissociation, some equations are derived for these properties using an extension of earlier transition state and quasi-unimolecular theories. The present formalism differs from previous formulations of the latter in a number of ways, particularly in the expression used for the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> of the high energy molecules. Subsequent applications of the theory tentatively suggest that essentially all vibrational degrees of freedom of these molecules can contribute their energy to the vibrationally excited molecules.

40|$|Some {{isolated}} {{neutron stars}} show harmonically spaced absorption features in their thermal soft X-ray spectra. The {{interpretation of the}} features as a cyclotron line and its harmonics has been suggested, but the usual explanation of the harmonics as caused by relativistic effects fails because the relativistic corrections are extremely small in this case. We suggest that the features correspond to the peaks in the energy dependence of the free-free opacity in a quantizing magnetic field, known as quantum oscillations. The peaks arise when the transitions to new Landau levels become allowed with increasing the photon energy; they are strongly enhanced by the square-root singularities in the phase-space <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> in the case when the free (non-quantized) motion is effectively one-dimensional. To explore observable properties of these quantum oscillations, we calculate models of hydrogen neutron star atmospheres with B ∼ 10 ^ 10 - 10 ^ 11 G (i. e., electron cyclotron energy E_c,e = 0. 1 - 1 keV) and T_eff = 1 - 3 MK. Such conditions {{are thought to be}} typical for the so-called central compact objects in supernova remnants, such as 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209 in PKS 1209 - 51 / 52. We show that observable features at the electron cyclotron harmonics form at moderately large values of the quantization parameter, b_eff = E_c,e/kT_eff = 0. 5 - 20. The equivalent widths of the features can reach 100 - 200 eV; they grow with increasing b_eff and are lower for higher harmonics.
