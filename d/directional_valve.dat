5000|$|Open-loop: Pump-inlet and motor-return (via the <b>directional</b> <b>valve)</b> are {{connected}} to the hydraulic tank. The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed [...] "circuit". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is returned to tank through the control valve's open center; that is, when the control valve is centered, it provides an open return path to tank and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if the control valve is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid returns to tank through a pressure relief valve. Multiple control valves may be stacked in series. This type of circuit can use inexpensive, constant displacement pumps.|$|E

50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No <b>directional</b> <b>valve</b> and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|E

Moreover, the numerical model of the working fluid is modified in order to account also for the non-Newtonian fluids. The effects of the shear rate on the shear stress are accounted for both by using experimental measurements and correlations available in literature, such as the Herschel-Bulkley model.

The main focus {{of this study is}} on revealing the dynamic properties of the priority control system for a developed high-speed on–off digital valve. In this article, a detailed introduction to the high-speed on–off digital valve and its priority control system is performed first, which includes the system function, structural composition, and operation principle. Thereafter, a simulation model of the priority control system is established using the AMESim software and the dynamic characteristics are simulated. Simulation results including the variations in the pulse-width modulation signal, coil current, and the main spool displacement of the <b>directional</b> <b>valve</b> are presented and discussed. They indicate that the opening time of the main spool increases with the duty ratio of the voltage signal. Moreover, the main spool displacement is basically equal in one single pulse-width modulation signal cycle, and thus, it is proportional to the cycle number of the pulse-width modulation signal. As a consequence, the priority control system possesses a good dynamic characteristic for the high-speed on–off digital valve as a pilot valve to achieve proportional control of main spool displacement for the <b>directional</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{different}} loads on the individual bending actuators during gait as well as manufacturing inaccuracies, the same curvature of the bending actuators does not necessarily correspond to the same pressure level. For this reason, the pressure of each bending actuator is individually controlled by a proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valve,</b> and the valves are connected in parallel to a constant positive pressure source. Since the suction cups have only two states, namely vacuum on and vacuum off, we use direct acting solenoid valves that are parallel connected to a constant negative pressure source for their control. In order to obtain information about the pressure states in the bending actuators, digital pressure sensors are connected to all outputs of the proportional directional valves. A processing unit compares the measured data with the current reference values and then generates the corresponding control signals.|$|E

Firstly, the sound-gas pressure converter is proposed and improved so that self-excited vibration can be suppressed. Secondly, the basic characteristic of the sound-gas pressure converter is investigated to show that the back pressure is different depending on whether the sound of specific frequency is added or not. Furthermore, a pilot valve is developed. Because the pilot pressure change of the pilot valve developed is only 20 kPa, a main valve is proposed and developed.

Valve control has a high bandwidth, but the throttling loss is high. A novel approach has been proposed to distribute the control efforts between the pump and the proportional valve considering both control bandwidth balancing and throttling loss reduction. The proportional valve will follow a high frequency opening profile, while the nominal valve opening is large, and the pump output flow will follow a low frequency demand. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{hydraulically}} driven wheel loader, {{which has a}} flexible crane mounted {{in front of the}} machine, has been under research. Flexible boom was excited with a operator given commands, which caused the system vibrate due to different sources of flexibility. The goal was to test cylinder load pressure as a estimate of boom vibrations {{and use it as a}} feedback signal to suppress the system oscillations. Therefore, a simulation of wheel loader was created, which replicates real four wheel loader located at the facilities of Laboratory of Automation and Hydraulics. The first simulator represents a traditional hydraulical system, which has proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valves</b> and variable displacement pump with load sensing functions. A simple controller with pressure feedback vibration damping was designed and tested with different scenarios. After promising results, another simulator was created, which emulates the existing wheel loader better.

As a power source, IHA-machine has a variable displacement pump-motor, which has a possibility to collect energy from hydraulic system. Updated simulation version was tested with a controller, which was able to control flow and supply pressure. Vibration damping was added to the flow controller and tested in simulator. After this, the same controller was also tested in real IHA-machine. The results showed, that load pressure as an estimate of system vibrations is a promising way to damping the oscillations that exist in the application. However, the simulation results couldn't be repeated at the same level in the real machine.
