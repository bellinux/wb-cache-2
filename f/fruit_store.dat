40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Cold {{storage is}} {{needed in order to}} delay {{senescence}} and achieve a longer commercial life of tropical fruits like mamey sapote (Pouteria sapota), therefore, the physiological and biochemical responses of this fruit to cold storage were evaluated. Approach: Samples from different storage temperature (20, 10 and 2 °C) were taken at five-day intervals and Chilling Injury Index (CII), decay (%), pulp firmness, weight loss (%), sucrose, fructose and glucose contents, electrolyte leakage (%), ethylene and carbon dioxide production rates and the activities of Peroxidase (POD), Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasa (PAL), were evaluated. Results: CII of <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> at 2 and 10 °C was similar and symptoms included abnormal ripening into trimming zones close to the skin and pulp. Development of CI symptoms was more evident after 10 days of storage at 2 and 10 °C. This trend may be associated with decrease of sucrose content but not with fructose that increased on <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> at 2 °C (p< 0. 05). For mamey <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> at 2 °C, the PAL activity was significant lower than in the <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> at 10 °C, but it did not increase in response to the chilling temperature.

The experiment was conducted with eight treatments and four replications. The data were analyzed by adopting Completely Randomized Design. The study revealed that the fruits in refrigeration storage with ventilated polythene bags showed good shelf life compared to <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> in ambient condition with ventilated polythene bags.

The <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> without polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration had lowest shelf life and shrunk compared to ventilated polythene bag storage.

In this study, no pericarp browning was evident at out-turn on litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> for 10 and 20 days at cold temperature of 3 – 5 °C, but <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> for 10 days at 3 – 5 °C gradually browned after 12 h of shelf time {{at ambient temperature}} of 25 °C, with the browning index (BI) being elevated to 2. 5 at 24 h of shelf life. Furthermore, <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> for 30 days began to rot and had a decay incidence of about 30 % after 24 h on the shelf. The temperature increment from 3 – 5 to 25 °C induced marked increases in activities of lipase, phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> for 10 days at 3 – 5 °C followed by the shelf time at 25 °C had lower activities of lipase, PLD and LOX, and also lower levels of membrane permeability, than did <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> for 20 and 30 days. Energy level of the pericarp tissue of cold-stored litchi fruit was similarly dependent on storage time at 3 – 5 °C plus shelf time at 25 °C.

Therefore, colourless, blue, red and yellow polyethylene bags impregnated with or without sawdust were used for storing green mature plantain fruits. Control treatment was fruits lined on laboratory bench. Sample fruits enclosed in polyethylene were sealed under ambient laboratory conditions and thereafter opened weekly to assess postharvest changes. Inclusion of sawdust was {{not in any way}} more beneficial than without it. Relative light transmission through the four colours was expectedly different. Light intensity reduction by the colourless polyethylene was 3. 6 %, compared to 30 - 35 % reductions by blue and yellow polyethylene. Variation in light intensity transmitted explained about 90 % of weight loss in fruits. After three weeks of storage, weight loss from <b>fruit</b> <b>stored</b> in blue polyethylene was about 7 % compared to about 45 % in the control. Colour of polyethylene also significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced ripening pattern. Whereas 67 % of <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> in colourless, yellow and red polyethylene were still green after two weeks of storage, only 8 % of the control samples was still green. Organoleptic assessment of steamed boiled fruits after two weeks of storage revealed that <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> in blue and red polyethylene combined relatively high textural and general acceptability ratings, while <b>fruits</b> <b>stored</b> in yellow polyethylene had the highest textural rating.
