500|$|The {{function}} of theta {{has not yet}} been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed. [...] The most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory. An example would be the phase with which theta rhythms, at the time of stimulation of a neuron, shape the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stimulation upon its synapses. What is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity. [...] It is well established that lesions of the medial septum—the central node of the theta system—cause severe disruptions of memory. [...] However, the medial septum is more than just the controller of theta; it is also the main source of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. [...] It has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating the theta rhythm.|$|E
500|$|The Huaorani {{arrived at}} Palm Beach around 3:00p.m., {{and in order}} to divide the foreigners before attacking them, they sent three women {{to the other side of}} the river. One, Dawa, {{remained}} hidden in the jungle, but the other two showed themselves. Two of the missionaries waded into the water to greet them, but were attacked from behind by Nampa. Apparently attempting to scare him, Elliot, the first missionary to be speared, drew his pistol and began firing. One of these shots mildly injured Dawa, still hidden, and another grazed the missionary's attacker after he was grabbed from behind by one of the women. Accounts differ on the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> bullet. Missionaries interpreted the testimonies of Dawa and Dayuma to mean that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, but others, including missionary anthropologist James Yost, came to believe that his death was a result of the bullet wound. [...] Rachel Saint did not accept this, holding that eyewitnesses supported her position, but researcher Laura Rival, a critic of the expedition, suggests that it is now commonly believed among Huaorani that Nampa died of the wound. The other missionary in the river, Fleming, before being speared, desperately reiterated friendly overtures and asked the Huaorani why they were killing them. Meanwhile, the other Huaorani warriors, led by Gikita, attacked the three missionaries still on the beach, spearing Saint first, then McCully as he rushed to stop them. Youderian ran to the airplane to get to the radio, but he was speared as he picked up the microphone to report the attack. The Huaorani then threw the men's bodies and their belongings in the river, and ripped the fabric from their aircraft. They then returned to their village and, anticipating retribution, burned it to the ground and fled into the jungle.|$|E
