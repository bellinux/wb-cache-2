3000|$|Most Cost Effective {{scenarios}} (Scenarios 2 A, 4 A and 4 B – <b>Investment</b> and Operational <b>Grants</b> with {{or without}} Price Cap and only operational grant without price cap): The most cost effective scenarios in terms of budget spent per child enrolled {{as a result of}} these policies, are represented by Scenarios 2 and 4 where the operational and <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> are provided together. When a price cap is introduced, the benefit incidence accrues more to the poor households. Hence Scenario 4 B where operational grants are provided together with <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> and with a price cap is the most cost-effective and pro-poor scenario in terms of benefit incidence. Overall, these are the most cost effective and hence most recommended scenarios in the simulation – whereby the twin goals of attaining higher capacity and enrollments are also matched with a concern for lower costs per child and a pro-poor distribution.|$|R

5000|$|Banks are public, not private, {{institutions}} that make grants, not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants {{do not represent}} [...] "free money", since an <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring interest payments but no repayment of principal.|$|E

A political economy model for the allocation of public infrastructure <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> is formulated. Our empirical findings, using a panel of large German cities for the years 1980, 1986, and 1988, suggest that cities ruled by a council sharing the State (‘Bundesland’) government’s current political affiliation were particularly successful in attracting infrastructure <b>investment</b> <b>grants.</b> With regard to the contribution of infrastructure accumulation to growth, we find that public capital is {{a significant factor in}} private production. Moreover, at least for the sample studied, we find that simultaneity between output and public capital is weak; thus, feedback effects from output to infrastructure are negligible...|$|R

50|$|The {{education}} in the parish {{has a long history}} from 1686 with the St. Michaels School being first introduced as a private paid school, however it then got endowed and become a free public school. This was done by the lord of the manor, Henry Salkeld with an investment of 50 shillings. In 1896, the school got a local <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> from the local parish community of £180 for a new classroom, which can be linked with the rise of population during this time within the area. However, in 1989, the schools in the area of Fletchertown and Torpenhow had the schools removed and then Bothel School was built in its place and a district school and saw the St. Michaels School turned into a private house.|$|E

40|$|Grants are {{important}} part of municipal budgets. Due to horizontal and vertical imbalance, there are no possibility to resign from this source of financing local governments. According to theoretical model, which is discussed in this paper the impact of grants on municipal spending depend on income and price effect.

30|$|When an <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> is {{provided}} alone (Scenario 1), {{there is a}} small increase in capacity, while the impact on capacity of only providing operational grants is projected to be higher (Scenario 2 A and 2 B). With a one-time <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> and without operational grants, the capacity increase is estimated to be about 6 %. The one-time <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> does not create enough incentive in the model to expand capacity for child care centers, rather the operational grants seem to have a more convincing impact: when operational grants—with or without a price cap—are provided per child per month for 5  years, the impact on capacity is estimated to be 17 % with price cap and 24 % without the price cap (an estimated 2394 and 3306 new centers, respectively).|$|E

30|$|In the {{scenarios}} {{where there are}} no price caps, the newly created capacity accrues regressively and benefits the higher income quintiles disproportionately.

For instance, in {{the scenarios}} with the operational and <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> implemented together (scenario 4 A) without the price cap, 30.3 % of capacity generated is utilized by children in the bottom 40 % of the distribution. When there is a price cap in the scenarios with operational grants, the utilization of new capacity becomes more equitable. Looking at Scenario 4 B where the operational and <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> are provided together, we find that with the price cap imposed at 750 TL per child, the new capacity generated accrues more to the poor—with 39.9 % of capacity being utilized by children in the bottom 40 % of the income distribution.|$|R
