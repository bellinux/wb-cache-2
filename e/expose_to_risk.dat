40|$|Higher feeding {{costs and}} {{shortage}} of animal feed-stuffs {{in many parts}} of the word have increased the number of studies on agricultural by-products used as feeds for ruminants (Lashkari & Taghizadeh, 2013). Some of those by-products derive from industrial extraction and processing of fruits, vegetables and crops (Lashkari et al., 2014). The annual amount of produced agricultural by-products in Iran is high, e. g. production of apple (Malus domestica) pomace exceeds 2. 7 million tonnes year– 1. Apple pomace is a palatable raw material and has considerable attention as a source of sugar, pectin, and phenolic component (Sato et al., 2010). In fact, apple pomace is a suitable source of energy for ruminant, but its crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration are low (Pirmohammadi et al., 2006). However, high moisture content is the main problem in storage of agricultural by-products because of its susceptibility for spoiling, fungi and mold can <b>expose</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> human and animal health (Lashkari et al., 2014). Therefore, usage of apple pomace as feedstuff requires its preservation by dehydration or ensiling (Pirmoham-madi et al., 2006). Drying of apple pomace is costly; whereas its ensilage is cheaper and more practical for farmers. Apple pomace silage has been successfully used as a feed for ruminants. Rumsey (1979) showed that all of the beef cattle diet forage can be replaced by apple pomace without any adverse effect on the performance. Using of apple pomace in fattening lambs ration improved average daily gain, dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio (Karami et al., 1996). Broiler litter has been also successfully used as a cattle feed around the world for a long time (Kwak et al., 2004). Broiler litter is composed of poultry excreta, bedding, feathers, spilled feed, etc. Broiler litter contains 25 - 30 % CP kg of dry matter (Ruffin & McCaskey, 1990) and approximately 50 % of that is made up by true protein. The remainder is nonprotein nitrogen, which is primarily composed by uric acid (Bhattacharya & Taylor, 1975). Poultry litter has been Milk yield and composition, dry matter intake and blood parameters of Holstein cows fed ensiled apple pomace co-ensiled with broiler litte...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Risk-driven {{testing is}} a testing {{approach}} that aims at focus-ing the testing process on the aspects or {{features of the}} system under test that are most <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk.</b> Current risk-driven testing approaches suc-ceed in identifying the aspects or features that are most <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risks,</b> and thereby support testers in planning the testing process accordingly. However, they fail in supporting testers <b>to</b> employ <b>risk</b> analysis <b>to</b> sys-tematically design test cases. Because of this, there exists a gap between risks, which are often described and understood {{at a high level}} of abstrac-tion, and test cases, which are often defined at a low level of abstraction. In this paper, we bridge this gap. We give an example-driven presen-tation of a novel method, intended to assist testers, for systematically designing test cases by making use of risk analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to examine the}} different types of risk embedded in the various maturity periods of sukuk structure and to determine the relationship between the risks and the returns of sukuk. Data were collected from the sukuk market period from 2005 to 2015 on a periodic monthly basis and analyzed using descriptive, correlation and multiple regressions analysis. The test results confirm Dow Jones maturity base confirmed that four models explain 60 % to 86 % of variation at 5 % significance level. Dow Jones M 3 T sukuk return, Dow Jones M 5 T sukuk return, Dow Jones M 7 T sukuk return and Dow Jones M 10 T sukuk return are 60 %, 69 %, 72 % and 86 % <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> respectively. The significant influence of market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk on the sukuk returns in different ways. Further, the results of the analysis on the basis of maturity indicate that, long period of maturity based sukuk market, i. e. Dow Jones M 10 T sukuk return is highly <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk.</b> Conversely lowest maturity period sukuk is less <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk.</b> As such, it is possible to conclude that when the maturity period is increasing the risk impact also get increased in the sukuk structure.

Regarding risk, Table  2 shows that the self-employed are indeed more often <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> than paid employees, and that the share of those being <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> that actually feel strained by risk is also higher among the self-employed than among paid employees (indicating that the self-employed indeed have to bear the consequences of their mistakes, i.e., the “big financial losses,” themselves, while this may only partly be true for paid employees).

This study used an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that providing information about the risks of BM donation to allay unsubstantiated fears would reduce male and female participants' perceptions of risk for donation and joining the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (ABMDR). Males' and females' intentions to register on the ABMDR and their attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control (efficacy) in relation to registering were also explored. Participants were allocated randomly <b>to</b> either a <b>risk</b> (<b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> information about BM donation) or no-risk (not <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> information) condition. In partial support of hypotheses, exposure <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> information did reduce perceived risk for registering on the ABMDR for males only. Participants in the risk condition also demonstrated lower scores on attitude (males only) and intention compared with participants in the no-risk condition. These findings highlight the complex role of risk perceptions and gender differences in understanding people's decisions to join a BM registry. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|International {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} about advertising for cosmetic surgery (British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons [BAAPS], 2005, 2008). A recent study showed that exposure to such advertising resulted in a more negative body image and attitudes toward surgery among women living in the UK (Ashikali, Dittmar, & Ayers, 2015). This study investigates the impact of cosmetic surgery advertising on women living in Switzerland, a country with relatively little advertising for cosmetic surgery. A group of 145 women (mean age 23. 07) were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> advertising for cosmetic surgery containing either discount incentives, risk information, no additional information, or to the control condition. Exposure to advertising for cosmetic surgery resulted in increased dissatisfaction with both bodyweight and appearance. Highly materialistic women perceived such surgery as being less beneficial to their image when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> advertising for cosmetic surgery as well as when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> information rather than discount incentives. Moreover, appearance-dissatisfied women considered surgery {{to a lesser extent}} when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> information compared <b>to</b> discount incentives.
