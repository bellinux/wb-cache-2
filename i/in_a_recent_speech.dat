40|$|Neighborhood {{preservation}} from input {{space to}} output space {{is an essential}} element of selforganizing feature maps like the Kohonen-map. However, a measure for the preservation or violation of neighborhood relations, which is more systematic than just visual inspection of the map, was lacking. We show, that a topographic product P, first introduced in nonlinear dynamics, is <b>an</b> appropriate measure <b>in</b> this regard. It is sensitive to large scale violations of the neighborhood ordering, but does not account for neighborhood ordering distortions due to varying areal magnification factors. A vanishing value of the topographic product indicates a perfect neighborhood preservation, negative (positive) values indicate a too small (too large) output space dimensionality. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> simple example of maps from a 2 D input space onto 1 D, 2 D and 3 D output spaces we demonstrate how the topographic product picks the correct output space dimensionality. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> second example we map 19 D speech data onto various output spaces and find, that a 3 D output space (instead of 2 D) seems to be optimally suited to the data. This is <b>in</b> agreement with <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>speech</b> recognition experiment on the same data set...|$|R
