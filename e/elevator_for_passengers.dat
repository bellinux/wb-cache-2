50|$|Starting October 2013 {{works were}} {{initiated}} on both {{levels of the}} station to build two interconnecting <b>elevators</b> <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> with reduced mobility. Another, third elevator, is also being constructed connecting the upper level with the surface entrance. The only vestibule of the station is also under reconstruction. Once built, the surface elevator will feature the longest shaft in Montreal Metro, with the pit depth of about 25 meters. Works are expected to conclude by January 2016.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two levels: the upper, elevated level supports a ticketing concourse and faregates, while the lower ground level contains fully covered platforms linked from the upper level via staircases or <b>elevators</b> <b>for</b> handicap <b>passengers.</b> Breaking from the norm of older KTM Komuter stations, the Mid Valley station features high arched canopies and steel support frames, designs emulated in the Kepong Sentral station, another new KTM Komuter station opened later in 2006.|$|R
40|$|An {{elevator}} is a {{part and}} parcel of modern life in developed countries. The safety and reliability of an elevator system is of great importance as it carries people and other goods. During pick hours of the day, waiting long time in front of an elevator causes mental weariness. In this paper, we have hinted an automatic system that will estimate and display the free weight and volume of an <b>elevator</b> <b>for</b> the <b>passengers</b> using sensors and computer vision techniques. Then the passengers can make a decision and ride on their convenient elevators...|$|R
50|$|There is {{only one}} {{entrance}} to the station located on the southwestern corner {{at the intersection of}} 1st Street SE and C Street SE. A row of three escalators and a staircase brings passengers to the station's mezzanine level, where they may buy tickets from vending machines and pass through the faregates. Once passengers pass through these faregates, a pair of escalators brings passengers onto the platform. There are two <b>elevators</b> <b>for</b> handicapped <b>passengers,</b> one from street level to the mezzanine on the northwestern corner at the intersection of 1st Street SE and D Street SE and another between the mezzanine and platform.|$|R
50|$|The station's layout is {{somewhat}} {{consistent with other}} elevated Kelana Jaya Line stations, and is alike the Bangsar station. The station has three levels: The access points at street level, and the ticket area and adjoining platforms on two elevated levels.

500|$|There are a {{total of}} 32 {{elevators}} in the skyscraper, clustered into groups of six or eight. At the time of opening, 28 of these <b>elevators</b> were <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> use. Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several [...] "express" [...] elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while [...] "local" [...] elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. According to Vincent Curcio, [...] "these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is one of}} the new {{stations}} of the Ring Rail Line (Kehärata), located between the {{stations of}} Aviapolis and Leinelä. Although the Ring Rail Line opened on July 1, 2015, the airport railway station opened only on July 10, 2015, and only the Tietotie exit was accessible at this time. Because the exit was the one farther away from the terminal, a temporary shuttle bus was operated until the <b>elevators</b> <b>for</b> the <b>passenger</b> terminal-side exit were completed in December 2015. The escalators for the terminal-side exit were finally brought into use on March 17, 2016. The escalators are the longest in Finland at 72 meters length.|$|R
50|$|As an {{elevated}} station, Dato Keramat station contains two levels: The access points at street level, and the ticket area and adjoining platforms {{on the two}} elevated levels.

25|$|Throughout the Tricity, SKM {{has its own}} stops built {{only for}} its own use. The stops have high platforms, with tracks on both sides. Except at the Gdańsk Główny stop, all trains heading south stop at {{the western side of}} platform, and trains heading north on the eastern side. SKM is {{systematically}} working on improving the quality of stops, as most of them are currently in bad shape, lacking basic services such as <b>elevators</b> <b>for</b> handicapped <b>passengers</b> or proper ticket validators. The company recently launched a survey, asking visitors to its website which of the stops should be repaired first. Since January 2006 SKM decided to install video cameras at stops and stations in order to improve the security level on platforms and inside station buildings.|$|R
50|$|In April 1907, the Bellingham Herald {{announced}} that the Bellingham Bay Furniture Company, owned by T.S. Hamilton, had purchased the block for $15,000 cash and were rushing plans {{for the construction of}} the city's first skyscraper. Soon after the purchase, they dropped Teague's design in favor of one drawn by Frank C. Burns. These plans were for a largely unadorned seven-story building of all reinforced concrete crowned with false chimneys and a large wooden cornice (now gone). To maximize floor space, large pivoting windows would cover all sides of the building, eliminating the need for a lightwell {{in the middle of the}} building. Two <b>elevators,</b> one <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> and one <b>for</b> freight were included in the plans. Despite the buildings' size, it would actually only be 4000 sq ft larger than the company's previous quarters at Holly and Bay Streets.|$|R
