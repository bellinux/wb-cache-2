500|$|In 1996, Washington Post writer Bob Woodward {{reported}} that Hillary Clinton {{had been having}} [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with Eleanor Roosevelt {{from the start of}} Clinton's time as First Lady. Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent <b>Jean</b> <b>Houston.</b> Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding séances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided you choose the right person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E

40|$|In Texas: A Modem History David G. McComb, {{professor}} of history at Colorado State University, wanted to provide the 2 ̆ 2 adult reader 2 ̆ 2 with a 2 ̆ 2 brief, narrative history 2 ̆ 2 that would capture the 2 ̆ 2 ethos, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 flavor, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 rhythm 2 ̆ 2 of Texas (p. vii). He has succeeded. In seven short chapters (or 186 pages) he has spanned a myriad of historical subjects from the earliest Indian tribes, the Spanish conquest, the Alamo, and the cattle and oil industries to the present-day social, political, and 2 ̆ 2 economic complexities. At the same time he has woven into his story the humanness of Texans and Texas. Moreover, he has enhanced the narrative with anecdotes (such as the 2 ̆ 2 Bowie Knife, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Quanah Parker, 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 Astrodome 2 ̆ 2), photographs (including an offshore oil derrick, <b>Jean</b> Lafitte, and <b>Houston</b> freeways), as well as maps (such as the major state railroad systems).

500|$|Santa's Little Helper's initial {{appearance}} on The Simpsons {{was in the}} first episode of the series, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which aired on Dec. 17, 1989. Since then, he has become a recurring character. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide in 2000 that [...] "we [...] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him." [...] The name [...] "Santa's Little Helper" [...] was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same TV Guide article, [...] "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've got to use this name." [...] Although [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. <b>Jean</b> told the <b>Houston</b> Chronicle in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and [...] "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why." [...] He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.|$|R
