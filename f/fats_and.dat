40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that visceral fat releases {{free fatty acids}} and adipokines and thereby exposes the liver to fat accumulation. The authors aimed to evaluate current epidemiologic evidence for an association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. Clinical <b>and</b> epidemiologic studies with data on abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content were reviewed. Studies using waist circumference to estimate abdominal fat mass suggested a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. Studies using imaging methods suggested a direct association between intraabdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content, but not between subcutaneous abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. In conclusion, clinical and epidemiologic studies of abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content suggest a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content which is probably accounted for by visceral fat. However, results from the included studies do not allow strong conclusions regarding the temporal sequence of events. Future longitudinal studies are recommended to obtain additional information on associations and mechanisms.

5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes.

The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase. In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.|$|E

40|$|The {{principles}} of selection are reviewed {{as a basis}} for discussing selection for protein content of milk. The correlations among components of milk will cause correlated responses in all even when selection is for only one component. Selection for fractional composition of fat or protein would lead to increases in content of <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein, but the expected increases in total yields of <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein would be much less than if selection were for yield of milk, fat, or protein. Selection should be for milk, <b>fat,</b> <b>and</b> protein yield with relative economic emphasis determined by the net economic value of the components. Market prices less costs of production could be used for <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein yield and a negative transportation charge used for milk yield.

5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E

HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the incidence of cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cows was related to milk production parameters (milk yield, milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein) in early lactation with special emphasis on the negative energy balance (NEB). The diagnosis of COD was made by rectal palpation performed by veterinarians experienced in gynaecology. Data used for this field study were collected from November 1986 onwards. The dataset consisted of 6911 lactations (3891 cows) on 29 herds including 600 cases of COD (8. 7 %). Lactations in the COD group had higher average maximum productions of milk, energy corrected milk, milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein than lactations in the non-COD group. The average maximum milk fat:protein ratio did not significantly differ between the groups. Daily changes of the average maximum milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein percentage and of total milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein yield were calculated and divided into four groups depending on the day of first milk recording. No significant relations were found between changes in milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein percentage <b>and</b> total milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein yield, and the incidence of COD. It is concluded that elevated average peak milk yield, milk <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> protein yield in early lactation are risk factors for the incidence of COD, but the average milk fat:protein ratio is not. In this field study changes in milk <b>fat</b> percentage <b>and</b> milk <b>fat</b> yield, indicative for the presence of NEB, did not show a relation with the incidence of COD in early lactating cows.

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, <b>fats,</b> <b>and</b> oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E
