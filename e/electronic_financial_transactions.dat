50|$|His {{original}} idea {{was for a}} signet ring, or smart ring, embedded with a microchip as shown in his first patent filed on 25 March 1974, {{when he was just}} 29 years old. Moreno modeled the ring on the seal ring used by European nobility with an upside down microchip and external arms to transfer or read information. However, the idea proved both impractical and unpopular during the 1970s. Moreno then simplified the idea, introducing a plastic card with a microchip in 1975. He called it la carte à puce, literally the chip card in English, due to the small chip inserted into the plastic card. Moreno first demonstrated that the smart card could be used in <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> in 1976, using a machine which he held together with meccano.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} one of the first, and to our {{knowledge}} the most comprehensive, attempts to implement the strategy of surveying current users of electronic services. The study analyzes data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which included a battery of questions regarding households' use of <b>electronic</b> media for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> and decision making. Since the SCF also collects a large amount of other data on respondents' assets, liabilities, income, expenses, use of financial services, and demographic characteristics, the survey provides an extremely rich source of information on not only the current usage of electronic media, but also the socio-economic characteristics of both users and nonusers. Indeed, we believe the 1995 SCF provides the best opportunity available to establish "benchmark" statistics on households' use of <b>electronic</b> media for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> and decision making. The next section presents a brief review of the burgeoning electronic banking "literature," with a focus on demand-side concerns, and provides some aggregate perspective on the use of electronic payments instruments. Section III summarizes the 1995 SCF, and gives the definitions of electronic products and services used in this study.

In this paper, we proposed a passwordauthenticated key agreement scheme based on ECC. Our scheme provides more guarantees in security as follows: 1) the computation and communication cost is very low; 2) a user can freely choose and change his own password; 3) the privacy of users can be protected; 4) it generates a session key agreed upon by the user and the server; 5) it provides both implicit key and explicit key confirmation; and 6) it can prevent the offline dictionary attack even if the secret information stored in a smart card is compromised. And yet, our scheme is simpler and more efficient for smart card authentication...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of the Internet has contributed enormously towards the growth of e-commerce. Technological advances in mobile phones (e. g. Smartphones) have also {{made it possible to}} carry out e-commerce via mobile phones (m-commerce). M-commerce involves the use of mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDA’s in carrying out electronic transactions. Applications in this domain range from normal information consumption to high security <b>financial</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions.</b> Just like e-commerce, the security of m-commerce applications is critical, especially when it involves applications that deal with user sensitive data such as credit cards details, medical details etc. This thesis introduces a platform (e. g.

This was done by designing, prototyping and evaluating a platform-independent authentication method called OSP. An investigation and prototype implementation of how m-commerce applications can include secure payment capabilities was also presented.

40|$|Recently, {{small and}} medium {{businesses}} have lost {{millions of dollars}} from fraudulent <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> This paper reviews the threat and provides guidance for mitigating the threat. These crimes typically begin with a phishing email targeted at the comptroller or other staff in the finance department. After the comptroller's computer is compromised, sophisticated malware is used to eavesdrop on the comptroller's activity and account credentials for financial systems. Once the attackers have the required information, they begin to steal money with fraudulent transactions in amounts below $ 10, 000. These smaller amounts fly under the laundering detection mechanisms in the US Bank Secrecy Act. In many cases, repeated transactions have added up to {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} lost by individual organizations. The paper provides a number of possible ways to mitigate these types of attacks. A defense in depth approach is used to provide multiple mitigation recommendations. The number one recommended mitigation is to use a read-only bootable alternative media (ROBAM) as an isolated environment for financial transactions.

40|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in the use of currency due to the recent growth in the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions,</b> real money transactions remain very important in the global market. While performing transactions with real money, touching and counting notes by hand, is still a common practice in daily life, various types of automated machines, such as ATMs and banknote counters, are essential for large-scale and safe transactions. This paper presents studies that have been conducted in four major areas of research (banknote recognition, counterfeit banknote detection, serial number recognition, and fitness classification) in the accurate banknote recognition field by various sensors in such automated machines, and describes the advantages and drawbacks of the methods presented in those studies. While to a limited extent some surveys have been presented in previous studies in the areas of banknote recognition or counterfeit banknote recognition, this paper is {{the first of its kind}} to review all four areas. Techniques used in each of the four areas recognize banknote information (denomination, serial number, authenticity, and physical condition) based on image or sensor data, and are actually applied to banknote processing machines across the world. This study also describes the technological challenges faced by such banknote recognition techniques and presents future directions of research to overcome them...|$|E
40|$|It is {{said that}} money makes the world go round, {{but it is the}} global systems of {{communication}} that allow money to go round the world. The conjunction of deregulatory policies and the convergence of computing, telecommunications and other electronic media since the 1970 s led to a transformation in the way the global markets operate. The exponential increases in informatic processing capacity and the volume, velocity and extensity of <b>electronic</b> <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> has resulted in over $ 1. 5 trillion per day being traded through international financial exchanges. Much of this is speculative capital, constantly seeking new configurations of investment to maximise returns and responding with real- time sensitivity to minor fluctuations in prices and other market data. At the same time, the increasing volatility of contemporary financial markets is underscored by a series of recent crises and panics. Moreover, concern about capital flight and the vulnerability of domestic economies to the shifting perceptions and sentiments of offshore traders increases the pressure on governments to adopt neoliberal fiscal policies and enter into trade agreements whereby economic decision-making is delegated to supra-national forums with minimal democratic accountability.
