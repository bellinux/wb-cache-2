[...] Carrie's husband and their many children enter to fetch her—the family must {{get ready for}} the high school graduation later that day. [...] Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind [...] to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. [...] Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. [...] He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: [...] each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. [...] Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. [...] He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. [...] He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly. [...] Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy's presence ("If <b>I</b> <b>Loved</b> <b>You</b> (Reprise)").|$|E
