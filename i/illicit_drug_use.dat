This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction.

30|$|It’s {{known that}} drug {{dependency}} is a multifactorial issue which {{relies on the}} duration of <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> the {{type of the material}} used and the genetic susceptibility of the user (NIH 2007). A previous study was conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on drug users in Palestine based on personal interviews with some drug users who were found to <b>use</b> <b>drugs</b> on daily bases (UNDCP 2000). Most drug users (82.1 %) have <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> for more than 1  year, 39.3 % had <b>used</b> <b>drug</b> for more than 5  years, (47 %) were convicted of second or subsequent offenses, and (28.1 %) of the cases use two or more <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs.</b> <b>Using</b> two or more <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> is of great significance due to the potential harmful effects of some drug combinations that can lead to hazardous and sometimes deadliest results. The long duration of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and the recurrence of the arrest call for deterrent Palestinian law against drugs possession and <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> The <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> law in the West Bank was managed with the Jordanian law that was established in the West Bank in 1955 and it was modified in 1975 (Kordi 2014). This law is considered out of date regarding the new technical and pharmaceutical updates related to <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> and <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> It is also considered to be in the favor of drug users and drug dealers and always took the least harmful sentence against criminals. On the other hand, the absence of governmental rehabilitation centers and the high costs for treatment in private ones led to the absence of medical and psychosocial follow up for drug users which contributed to longer periods of <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Establishing of governmental rehabilitation centers in the West Bank that provide the psychological, social and medical care of drug addicts is recommended.|$|R
25|$|On a {{more general}} level, zero-tolerance advocates holds the aim at ridding the society of all <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and that {{criminal}} justice has {{an important role in}} that endeavor. The Swedish parliament for example set the vision a drug-free society as the official goal for the drug policy in 1978. These visions were to prompt new practices inspired by Nils Bejerot, practices later labeled as Zero tolerance. In 1980 the Swedish attorney general finally dropped the practice of giving waivers for possession of drugs for personal use after years of lowering the thresholds. The same year, police began to prioritize drug users and street-level drug crimes over drug distributors. In 1988 all non medicinally prescribed usage became illegal and in 1993 the enforcement of personal use were eased by permitting the police to take blood or urine samples from suspects. This unrelenting approach towards drug users, together with generous treatment opportunities, have won UNODC's approval, and is cited by the UN as {{one of the main reasons}} for Sweden's relatively low drug prevalence rates. However, that interpretation of the statistics and the more general success of Sweden's drug policies are highly questioned.|$|E

Richards has been tried on drug-related charges five times: in 1967, twice in 1973, in 1977, and in 1978. The first trial – the only one {{involving}} a prison sentence – resulted from a February 1967 police raid on Redlands, Richards' Sussex estate, where he and some friends, including Jagger, were spending the weekend. The subsequent arrest of Richards and Jagger put them on trial before the British courts, while also exposing them to public opinion. On 29 June 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets. Richards {{was found guilty of}} allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point: Jagger was taken to Brixton Prison in south London, and Richards to Wormwood Scrubs Prison in west London. Both were released on bail the next day pending appeal. On 1 July The Times ran an editorial entitled Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?, portraying Jagger's sentence as persecution, and public sentiment against the convictions increased. A month later the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction for lack of evidence, and gave Jagger a conditional discharge.|$|E
