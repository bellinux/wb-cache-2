40|$|We use {{three-dimensional}} hydrodynamic numerical simulations {{to study}} phase transformations occurring in a clumpy interstellar gas exposed to time-dependent volumetric heating.

A second model with n_ 0 = 1 cm^- 3 is also considered. Variations of the heating rate on a timescale of 1 - 10 Myr applied thereafter cause pressure variations in the gas and shifting of the thermal equilibrium curve in the phase plane. This stimulates mass transfer between the gas phases via thermal instability, converting 5 - 10 % of the thermal energy into kinetic energy of gas motions. The experiments demonstrate that recurrent substantial heating episodes can maintain turbulence at this level.

H I Lyman α is suspected to be the dominant component of the FUV emission from Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs), but is difficult to measure directly due to circumstellar and interstel-lar H I absorption. To better characterize the intrinsic Lyman α radiation, we present FUV spectra of 14 CTTSs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope COS and STIS instruments. H 2 fluorescence, commonly seen in the spectra of CTTSs, is excited by Lyman α photons, providing an indirect mea-sure of the Lyman α flux incident upon the warm disk surface.

The Lyman α flux correlates with total measured FUV flux, in agreement with an accretion-related source of FUV emission.

Our models provide a self-consistent treatment of the chemical and thermal balance together with the radiative transfer of the CO line emission. We present results for clouds with power-law density gradients with average hydrogen particle densities 〈n 〉 ranging from 10 4 to 10 7 cm − 3 and total average hydrogen column densities 〈N〉 between 2. 5 × 10 21 and 4. 0 × 10 22 cm − 2. We consider clouds exposed to FUV fields (χ) 10 2 to 10 4 times more intense than the mean interstellar radiation field. We find that the resulting line ratios are insensitive to the cloud conditions and reproduce the observed values of the relative CO line strengths.

40|$|Collapse and {{fragmentation}} of uniform filamentary clouds under isotropic <b>far-ultraviolet</b> external <b>radiation</b> are investigated. Especially, impact of photodissociation of hydrogen molecules during collapse is investigated. Dynamical and thermal evolution of collapsing filamentary clouds are calculated by solving virial equation and energy equation with taking into accounts non-equilibrium chemical reactions. It is found that thermal evolution is hardly {{affected by the}} external radiation if the initial density is high (n_ 0 > 10 ^ 2 cm^- 3). On the other hand, if line mass of the filamentary cloud is moderate and initial density is low (n_ 0 < 10 ^ 2 cm^- 3), thermal evolution of the filamentary cloud tends to be adiabatic owing {{to the effect of}} the external dissociation radiation. In this case, collapse of the filamentary cloud is suppressed and the filamentary cloud fragments into very massive clouds (∼ 10 ^ 4 - 5 M_) in the early stage of collapse. Analytic criterion for the filamentary clouds to fragment into such massive clouds is discussed. We also investigate collapse and {{fragmentation of}} the filamentary clouds with an improved model. This model can partly capture the effect of run-away collapse. Also in this model, the filamentary clouds with low initial density (n_ 0 < 10 ^ 2 cm^- 3) fragment into massive clouds (∼ 10 ^ 4 M_) owing to the effect of the external radiation.
