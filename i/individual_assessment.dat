There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores.

I/O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees. The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, <b>individual</b> <b>assessment</b> is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, personality tests, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, simulations, and assessment centres.|$|E

Throughout his career he never hesitated to depart from his own rules in dealing with exceptional cases, such as that of Groningen.

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, <b>individual</b> <b>assessment</b> is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

This leads to less self-awareness in the group because the team together is the only body evaluated. (Curt. 2007) ...|$|E

Method: With eight reviewers and four papers describing human-centric software engineering experiments, we used a quality checklist with nine questions.
