By geometrical methods which were an early use of calculus, he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>calculate</b> the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body.

Since his topic is complex and difficult, the poet tells his audience that they can [...] "expect truth but not beauty". The poet them discusses the third astrologically significant circle, that of lots, which are the points on a birth chart that carry special significance.

Indeed, most scholars consider the third book to be highly technical. Goold contends that it [...] "is the least poetical of the five, exemplifying for the most part Manilius's skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters."
