40|$|Hendra {{virus is}} a new virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus was first {{detected}} in Queensland, Australia, in 1994; although, {{it seems that the}} virus has infected fruit-eating bats (<b>flying-foxes)</b> for a very long time. At least 2 humans and 15 horses have been killed by this virus since it first emerged as a virus that may infect mammals other than <b>flying-foxes.</b> Hendra virus is thought to have moved from <b>flying-foxes</b> to horses, and then from horses to people. There is a reasonably strong hypothesis for horse-to-human transmission: transmission of virus via nasal discharge, saliva and/or urine. In contrast, there is no strong hypothesis for flying-fox-to-human transmission. I present evidence that the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, which has apparently only recently become a parasite of <b>flying-foxes,</b> may transmit Hendra virus and perhaps related viruses from <b>flying-foxes</b> to horses and other mammals.

40|$|The {{physiological}} stress hormone levels and physical condition of captured urban <b>flying-foxes</b> experiencing a food shortage {{were compared with}} those of free-living rural <b>flying-foxes</b> with access to supplementary food. Glucocorticoid hormone levels were determined by measuring glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) from the faeces of individual animals. The rural <b>flying-foxes</b> were in good condition with high Body Condition Indexes (BCIs) and low levels of GCMs, the range of which may be considered the baseline for this species. In comparison, urban <b>flying-foxes</b> had lower BCIs and elevated levels of GCMs: 75 % had levels that were higher than the rural range and 30 % were higher by an order of magnitude. Such elevated levels of glucocorticoid ('stress') hormones are characteristic of chronic stress. While urbanisation can cause chronic stress, given the low BCIs observed, {{it is more likely that}} food shortage was the major stressor in this study. While the rural male and female <b>flying-foxes</b> showed no significant differences in either their levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites or their BCIs, significantly different results were found between male and female urban flying-foxes: males were in relatively better condition than females but had higher levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. The autumn and winter reproductive constraints on food-restricted <b>flying-foxes</b> probably explain the differences observed. Additional droppings collected under the urban colony gave similar results to those collected from captured <b>flying-foxes</b> at the same location, and could be a useful non-invasive method for determining the levels of {{physiological stress}} in flying-fox colonies. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{survivors}} {{is a term}} {{applied to}} wild species inhabiting urban areas and successfully coping with anthropogenic pollution, including urban noise. Grey-headed <b>flying-foxes</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus) are highly vocal mammals inhabiting {{urban and rural areas}} in NSW, Australia. Understanding the strategies used by this urban species to communicate in spite of anthropogenic noise may reveal why other species are unsuccessful. We investigated if, similar to songbirds, <b>flying-foxes</b> in urban areas would use vocalizations with acoustic structures that differ from <b>flying-foxes</b> inhabiting rural areas. We recorded <b>flying-foxes</b> in five urban and rural camps over 12 wks. Analysis of soundscapes and individual vocalizations revealed no differences in dominant frequencies, syllable rates or amplitude. Only when anthropogenic noise exceeded 66 dBA – from low aircraft overflights in urban camps – were the <b>flying-foxes</b> affected. In these cases, the animals ceased vocalizing until the aircraft noise had abated. SPL of the camps is 55 - 57 dBA from the flying-foxes’ calls, in short, these are extremely loud animals. Thus, they are urban survivors partly because they are as noisy as their human neighbors. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Hendra virus (HeV) is {{a lethal}} {{zoonotic}} agent {{that emerged in}} 1994 in Australia. Pteropid bats (<b>flying-foxes)</b> are the natural reservoir. To date, HeV has spilled over from <b>flying-foxes</b> to horses on 51 known occasions, and from infected horses to close-contact humans on seven occasions. We undertook screening of archived bat tissues for HeV by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Tissues were tested from 310 bats including 295 Pteropodiformes and 15 Vespertilioniformes. HeV was detected in 20 individual <b>flying-foxes</b> (6. 4 %) from various tissues including spleen, kidney, liver, lung, placenta and blood components.

Further, our findings indicate that HeV has a predilection for the spleen, suggesting this organ {{plays an important role in}} HeV infection. The lack of detections in the foetal tissues of HeV-positive females suggests that vertical transmission is not a regular mode of transmission in naturally infected <b>flying-foxes,</b> and that placental and foetal tissues are not a major source of infection for horses.

40|$|Globally, island bats are {{vulnerable}} to subsistence hunting, with widespread population declines, local extirpations and extinctions. Bats {{are important to the}} ecological functioning of remote oceanic islands, and thus the sustainable management of hunting of flying foxes Pteropus spp. is a conservation priority in the Pacific. In Solomon Islands people hunt flying foxes for bushmeat and their canine teeth, which are used as traditional currency. The value of teeth potentially increases hunting pressure on species of Pteropus. We interviewed 197 people on Makira Island to determine the nature of this use and how it may influence <b>flying-fox</b> populations. We asked questions to gather information about hunting practices, the value of canine teeth, utilization of traditional currency, and population trends of Pteropus. <b>Flying-fox</b> teeth remain highly valued on Makira. It is primarily the teeth of P. tonganus that are used rather than those of the smaller P. cognatus. Although flying foxes are not targeted solely for their teeth, this added value seemingly drives hunters to focus on P. tonganus.

40|$|Urbanisation of {{wildlife}} populations {{is a process}} with significant conservation and management implications. While urban areas can provide habitat for wildlife, some urbanised species eventually come into conflict with humans. Understanding the process and drivers {{of wildlife}} urbanisation is fundamental to developing effective management responses to this phenomenon. In Australia, <b>flying-foxes</b> (Pteropodidae) are a common feature of urban environments, sometimes roosting in groups {{of tens of thousands}} of individuals. <b>Flying-foxes</b> appear to be becoming increasingly urbanised and are coming into increased contact and conflict with humans. Flying-fox management is now a highly contentious issue. In this study we used monitoring data collected over a 15 year period (1998 – 2012) to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of association of spectacled flying-fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) roost sites (camps) with urban areas. We asked whether spectacled <b>flying-foxes</b> are becoming more urbanised and test the hypothesis that such changes are associated with anthropogenic changes to landscape structure. Our results indicate that spectacled <b>flying-foxes</b> were more likely to roost near humans than might be expected by chance, that over the period of the study the proportion of the <b>flying-foxes</b> in urban-associated camps increased, as did the number of urban camps.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the foraging of mobile native fauna in highly fragmented urban landscapes have seldom been quantified at large spatial scales. We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed <b>Flying-foxes</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus; 2 ̆ 7 <b>flying-foxes</b> 2 ̆ 7) {{in the greater}} Melbourne metropolitan area. <b>Flying-foxes</b> established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, {{and the size of}} the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratified-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging flying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0 - 5 and 5 - 20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30 -km radius of the colony site for foraging <b>flying-foxes</b> in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging flying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. <b>Flying-foxes</b> were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. <b>Flying-foxes</b> in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization...|$|E
40|$|Hendra virus (HeV) causes highly lethal {{disease in}} horses and humans {{in the eastern}} Australian states of Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW), with {{multiple}} equine cases now reported on an annual basis. Infection and excretion dynamics in pteropid bats (<b>flying-foxes),</b> the recognised natural reservoir, are incompletely understood. We sought to identify key spatial and temporal factors associated with excretion in <b>flying-foxes</b> over a 2300 km latitudinal gradient from northern QLD to southern NSW which encompassed all known equine case locations. The aim was to strengthen knowledge of Hendra virus ecology in <b>flying-foxes</b> to improve spillover risk prediction and exposure risk mitigation strategies, and thus better protect horses and humans. Monthly pooled urine samples were collected from under roosting <b>flying-foxes</b> {{over a three-year period}} and screened for HeV RNA by quantitative RT-PCR. A generalised linear model was employed to investigate spatiotemporal associations with HeV detection in 13, 968 samples from 27 roosts. There was a non-linear relationship between mean HeV excretion prevalence and five latitudinal regions, with excretion moderate in northern and central QLD, highest in southern QLD/northern NSW, moderate in central NSW, and negligible in southern NSW. Highest HeV positivity occurred where black or spectacled <b>flying-foxes</b> were present; nil or very low positivity rates occurred in exclusive grey-headed flying-fox roosts. Similarly, little red <b>flying-foxes</b> are evidently not a significant source of virus, as their periodic extreme increase in numbers at some roosts was not associated with any concurrent increase in HeV detection. There was a consistent, strong winter seasonality to excretion in the southern QLD/northern NSW and central NSW regions.
