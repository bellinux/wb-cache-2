5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E

However, after the ban there was a steep decline <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} peak intensity, a {{sharp increase in}} wind shear caused Emilia to weaken quickly to winds of 50mph (85km/h). Operationally, the NHC initially continued to assess the storm as with winds of 70mph (115m/h), with hurricane status predicted. However, the decrease in strength became evident on July 24, when dry air became entrained in the circulation; at the same time, the convection became limited to the southern semicircle of the storm. On July 25, the wind shear decreased as the storm turned toward the Baja California peninsula, despite that tropical cyclones affecting the Baja California peninsula in the month of July are rare. Convection increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage,</b> and an eye feature re-appeared early on July 26 as it again attained peak winds of 65mph (105km/h).|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorm {{activity}} {{near the}} eye soon decreased <b>in</b> <b>coverage,</b> and Lidia began a weakening trend. Because of two troughs, {{one over the}} northern Gulf of California and another over the Southwestern United States, the weakening system began to re-curve northeast. Heading towards mainland Mexico, the hurricane weakened significantly a day after its peak, in which Lidia was only a mid-level Category2 hurricane. Continuing to weaken, Lidia made landfall in Sinaloa at 1800UTC on September13. Shortly after landfall, Hurricane Lidia then accelerated northeastward and then east-northeastward. It weakened to a depression just after crossing the international border with Texas. Tropical Depression Lidia dissipated near Austin on September14. The remnants of the cyclone were absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

40|$|James Larson for {{excellent}} {{research assistance}} and Mark Duggan and seminar {{participants at the}} ERIU Ann Arbor conference for helpful comments. Trends <b>in</b> Health Insurance <b>Coverage</b> among Low-Skilled Women We analyze the trends <b>in</b> health insurance <b>coverage</b> for women {{with less than a}} high school education during the 1990 s and also examine how welfare reform affected their probability of insurance coverage. We compare the experiences of these women with trends for women with a high school and college education. We find that the probability of having health insurance declined for all of these groups during the 1990 s, but the reasons for these declines differ across groups. Women with less than a high school education experienced a large decline in the probability of having health insurance as a result of declines <b>in</b> spousal <b>coverage</b> (due both to declines in marriage and to declines <b>in</b> spousal <b>coverage)</b> and declines <b>in</b> own-employer sponsored <b>coverage</b> for among workers. By contrast, women with a high school degree experienced a smaller decline <b>in</b> health insurance <b>coverage</b> during the 1990 s, mostly because declines <b>in</b> spousal <b>coverage</b> were partially offset by increases <b>in</b> own-employer <b>coverage.</b> Women with a college education experienced only very small declines in the probability of health insurance <b>coverage</b> <b>in</b> the 1990 s. Against this backdrop of large overall declines <b>in</b> health insurance <b>coverage,</b> welfare reform appears to have led to a modest increase <b>in</b> health insurance <b>coverage</b> for women with less than a high school degree, primarily by increasing the probability of having private health insurance. This modest increase was not large enough to offset the large secular declines <b>in</b> health insurance <b>coverage</b> among low-skilled wome...|$|R

5|$|Typhoon Abby {{originated}} {{from an area}} of enhanced convective activity southeast of Guam on July31. While moving south of Guam, the area failed to organized significantly until August3, when thunderstorm activity increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage.</b> Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 2300UTC. Initially, the system struggled to develop a closed atmospheric circulation. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system early on August5 {{and was able to}} locate a closed surface circulation. Based on this, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, both agencies upgraded the system into a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|With a large {{anticyclone}} centered near Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Carlotta turned {{more to the}} west. Deep convection increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> {{and intensity}} as the system maintained impressive upper-level outflow over its southern semicircle. Late on June 20, Hurricane Carlotta began a period of rapid deepening, with warm waters and a very favorable upper-level environment, and in a twelve-hour period the pressure dropped 49mbar to an estimated minimum central pressure of 932mbar at 0600UTC on June 21; at the same time, Carlotta attained peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) while located about 285miles (455km) southwest of Acapulco. At {{the time of its}} peak intensity, Carlotta maintained a well-defined central dense overcast around an eye of 20miles (36km) in diameter. Satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of 160mph (260km/h), though through much of its duration there was a sizable discrepancy between the estimated winds and that of winds reported by Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|In {{training}} camp, Allen {{competed with}} Wes Lysack and Eric Fraser for the starting safety position. Lysack and Fraser {{were considered to}} be stronger players than Allen physically, but Allen was both quicker and possessed greater ability <b>in</b> <b>coverage.</b> Allen started the first preseason game at safety but also spent significant time on the field as a cornerback, his previous position. After making the regular season roster, Allen spent the month of July moving on and off the roster but playing in no games. Allen made his CFL debut on July 31, 2010 in a 23–20 win against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, in which he played off the bench. He continued to spend most of his time on the inactive list or the practice squad throughout the season, playing sporadically. Allen also missed playing time due to a leg injury. He finished the season with seven tackles in six games. Allen's contributions were largely on special teams, where he performed five of his tackles. He played in the West Final against the Saskatchewan Roughriders.|$|E

5|$|On July29, 1987, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward along the southern edge of the Saharan Air Layer, a feature associated with large masses of dry air, little convective development took place over the following several days. Once near the Lesser Antilles in early August, atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development. Traveling across the Caribbean Sea, the system became increasingly organized and a mid-level circulation formed shortly before the wave moved inland over Central America on August7. The following day, the northern portion of the wave interacted with a cold-core low over the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the formation of a low-level circulation, exhibiting tropical characteristics, on August9. Over the following two days, the system tracked in a general north-northwest direction towards the Texas coastline. Aided by an anticyclone aloft, outflow became pronounced and convection increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> and intensity. Around 1200UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system developed into {{a tropical}} depression while located about 145miles (235km) south-southeast of Galveston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, and coalesced into a Central American gyre—a broad monsoonal circulation. A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually reached Central America on October15; the two systems merged the following day near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre, complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a cold front, enhanced vorticity and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of convection—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation—a propagating climate pattern associated with increased tropical cyclogenesis—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked west to west-northwest upon classification, steered by a mid-level ridge centered {{over the}} southwestern United States. Deep convection increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> and intensity {{over the following}} hours, leading {{to an increase in}} satellite intensity estimates; at 0600UTC, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. Within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Flossie gradually intensified over the next two days; a mid-level eye became observable in microwave imagery and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on July27. At 1200UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994mb (hPa; 29.35inHg). Thereafter, Flossie crossed the 140th meridian west into the central Pacific Ocean, where the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) assumed responsibility of the system. Unfavorable upper-level winds in association with an upper-level trough began to impede the system's organization around this time, and it began a slow weakening trend.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted in a slow, meandering motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of meandering without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase <b>in</b> <b>coverage.</b> Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cluster}} of {{thunderstorms}} was tracking through Missouri, {{a new line of}} thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, demarcating a dry line boundary. Although linear storm systems tend to indicate strong wind events and not tornadoes, these storms tracked eastward into southwestern Missouri and eventually produced several tornadoes. A long-tracked EF3 developed from one of these supercells and struck Cincinnati, Arkansas. At 13:31UTC on December31, a tornado watch was issued for much of Missouri and portions of Arkansas and Illinois. Most of the tornadoes during the outbreak stemmed from this line of storms as they moved through Missouri and Illinois throughout the day. At around noon, a new cluster of disorganized showers formed over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Although these storms were initially weak, they gradually intensified into supercells as the day went on. Additional supercells quickly developed over Louisiana and eventually spread <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> over Mississippi, resulting in the development of several tornadoes. Reaching their peak strength over Mississippi, the storms gradually lost their intensity as they tracked eastward late on December31 and into January1, 2011. By the morning hours of January1, severe activity had become restricted to the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama; the last tornado watch issued in association with the 2010New Year's Eve tornado outbreak was issued for those regions at 15:56UTC that day.|$|E
5|$|With a {{ridge to}} the east, the system tracked to the north-northwest through {{an area of}} warm water temperatures. At 1200UTC on September30, the JMA {{upgraded}} the depression to Tropical Storm Fitow. Although outflow and convection increased in general, the thunderstorm activity diminished over the center due to sinking air. By late on October1, however, convection increased over Fitow's center, {{and the next day}} the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. On October2, an eye began developing on satellite imagery, although the rainbands wrapping into the eye were fragmented. It took until midday on October3 for the JTWC to upgrade Fitow to typhoon status, with 1minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). By that time, the convection had increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> and intensity, with outflow increased by a trough to the north. The JMA did not follow suit until 1200UTC on October4, by which time the eye had become better defined.|$|E

5|$|With the {{hurricane}} situated {{to the southwest}} of the Hawaiian Islands, Hurricane Hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm. On September2, they found maximum surface winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 957mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg); this corresponded to the peak intensity of Uleki. At the time, Uleki displayed a well-organized, tight circulation. The hurricane meandered in the same general area {{over the next two}} days, executing several small loops, with a slight northward drift. During this time, its circulation increased <b>in</b> <b>coverage</b> but became less-organized as weakening ensued. Increased wind shear and restricted outflow took their toll on {{the hurricane}}. The cyclone's winds dropped to 80mph (130km/h) by 12:00UTC on September4 as it resumed its west-northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the Hawaiian Islands. Uleki passed roughly halfway between Johnston Atoll and the French Frigate Shoals on September5. By September7, the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification. As Uleki neared the International Dateline, it regained winds of 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
