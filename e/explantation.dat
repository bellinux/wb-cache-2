25|$|Because {{external}} vacuum {{expansion of}} the recipient-site tissues permits injecting large-volume fat grafts (+300cc) to correct defects and enhance the bust, the histologic viability of the breast filler (adipocyte fat) and its volume must be monitored and maintained.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare implant stability, survival, {{and soft}} tissue {{reactions}} for a novel (test) and previous generation (control) percutaneous auditory osseointegrated implant for bone conduction hearing at long-term follow-up of 5 years. STUDY DESIGN: Single follow-up visit of a previously completed multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven of the 77 participants of a completed randomized controlled trial {{on a new}} auditory osseointegrated implant underwent a single follow-up visit 5 years after implantation, which comprised implant stability measurements and collection of Holgers scores. Additionally, implant survival was recorded for all 77 patients from the original trial. RESULTS: The test implant showed significantly higher implant stability quotient (ISQ) values compared with the control implant throughout the 5 -year follow-up. Mean area under the curve of ISQ high from baseline to 5 years was 71. 6 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 2. 0) and 66. 7 (SD +/- 3. 4) for the test and control implant, respectively (p < 0. 0001). For both implants, the mean ISQ value recorded at 5 years was higher compared with implantation (test group + 2. 03 [SD +/- 2. 55, within group p < 0. 0001] and control group + 2. 25 [SD +/- 4. 95, within group p = 0. 12]). No difference was noticed in increase from baseline between groups (p = 0. 64). Furthermore, evaluation of soft tissue reactions continued to show superiority of the test implant. At the 5 -year follow-up visit, one patient (2. 5 %) presented with a Holgers grade 2 in the test group, compared with four patients (23. 5 %) {{in the control group}} (p = 0. 048); no patient presented with more severe soft tissue reactions. Excluding <b>explantations,</b> the survival rate was 95. 8 % for the test group and 95. 0 % for the control group. The corresponding rates including <b>explantations</b> were 93. 9 and 90. 0 %.

METHODS: Twenty-eight Wistar rats were implanted with synthetic meshes that were either non-absorbable (polypropylene (PP), n = 14) or absorbable (poly (D:,L: -lactic acid) (PLA 94), n = 14). A validated animal incisionnal abdominal hernia model of mesh infection was used. Fourteen meshes (n = 7 PLA 94 and n = 7 PP meshes) were infected intraoperatively with 10 e 6 CFU Escherichia coli, and compared with 14 non-infected meshes (n = 7 PLA 94 and n = 7 PP meshes) (control groups). <b>Explantations</b> were performed on day 30.

40|$|PURPOSE: To test in a pig {{model the}} {{biocompatibility}} {{and effectiveness of}} carbon-coated renal and iliac artery stent systems during implantation procedures and at different follow-up periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two miniature pigs received carbon-coated balloon-expandable stainless-steel stents in their renal and iliac arteries. Animals were killed at 7, 30, or 180 days for evaluation of acute, subacute, and chronic biologic response to the implanted devices. Histologic, histomorphometric, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed to assess inflammatory reaction, endothelialization process, and neointimal growth. RESULTS: Forty-four iliac stents and 42 renal stents were successfully implanted. Mural thrombi were not observed by angiography or histologic examinations. Histologically, no significant inflammatory reaction was detected: the stents appeared covered by a thin monolayer of endothelial cells even at 7 -day follow-up. The neointima showed homogeneous growth and moderate thickness at 30 -day and 180 -day <b>explantations</b> (0. 09 mm +/- 0. 06 and 0. 15 mm +/- 0. 13, respectively, for renal arteries; 0. 12 mm +/- 0. 04 and 0. 21 mm +/- 0. 12, respectively, for iliac arteries). Internal and external elastic laminae were intact in 82 of 86 cases (95 %) of stent-implanted arteries. Histologic validations were obtained with SEM observations for each follow-up group.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Patients with chronic external otitis and either {{moderate to severe}} sensorineural or conductive/mixed hearing loss. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. INTERVENTION: Implantation with the VSB, MET, or FIMOS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical complications, number of reimplantations, and <b>explantations.</b> RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were implanted, 12 patients with a round window or stapes application. 28 patients were lost to follow-up. The average follow-up duration was 4. 4 years (range, 1 month- 15 years). 128 devices were evaluated: (92 VSB, 32 MET, 4 FIMOS). 36 devices (28 %) have been explanted or replaced (18 VSB, 14 MET, 4 FIMOS). Device failure was 7 % for VSB, 28 % for MET, and 100 % for FIMOS. In 16 patients (17 %) revision surgery (n = 20) was performed. Twenty patients (21 %) suffered any medical complication.

Design: A retrospective, nonrandomized, case series. Participants: Data of 29 eyes (16 patients) receiving I-CARE phakic IOL for high myopia (- 11, 66 ± 3, 3) was analyzed. Methods: The IOLs were implanted between 2003 and 2006 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University, Graz, Austria. The mean follow up was 51. 7 ± 16 months (17 - 78 months). Main Outcome Measures: We measured uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); patients underwent, slit-lamp examination, corneal topography, Scheimpflug imaging and measurement of endothelial cells (EC). Results: Mean UCVA and BCSVA were 0. 63 and 0. 94 decimal after one year. Endothelial cell loss {{was the most}} serious adverse event observed. Mean EC loss was 2 %, 9 %, 17 %, 21 %, 33 % and 47 % after one (n= 17), two (n= 20), three (n= 17), four (n= 17), five (n= 12) and six (n= 3) years, respectively.

BackgroundProfessional societies have developed guideline criteria for the appropriate implantation of an ICD for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. It is unknown whether patients continue to meet criteria when their devices need replacement for battery depletion. MethodsWe performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing replacement of primary prevention ICDs at 2  tertiary Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Indications for continued ICD therapy at the time of generator replacement included a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  ≤ 35 % or receipt of appropriate device therapy. ResultsIn our cohort of 231 patients, 59 (26 %) no longer met guideline-driven indications for an ICD at the time of generator replacement. An additional 79 patients (34 %) had not received any appropriate ICD therapies and had not undergone reassessment of their LVEF. Patients with an initial LVEF of 30 % to 35 % were less likely to meet indications for ICD therapy at the time of replacement (odds ratio: 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 30 to 0. 88; p =  0. 01). Patients without ICD indications subsequently received appropriate ICD therapies at a significantly lower rate than patients with indications (2. 8 % vs. 10. 7 % annually, p < 0. 001).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –monitored clinical trial results with the LAP-BAND system (INAMED Health, Santa Barbara, CA) did not reproduce the results of studies performed elsewhere in the world. This article reviews data from the first and second FDA clinical trials as well as data from continuing US clinical experience. Four American surgeons at 4 centers have performed more than 500 LAP-BAND procedures not included in the first 2 FDA clinical trials. Of these patients, 115 have been followed for at least 9 months, and 43 have been followed for at least 12 months. A retrospective analysis of prospective data gathered from these patients is presented. The percent excess weight loss was 35. 6 % at 9 months and 41. 6 % at 12 months. The average body mass index decreased from 47. 5 to 38. 8 in 9 months and from 47. 5 to 37. 3 in 12 months. There were no deaths related to the insertion of the device. Of 15 complications requiring operative management (13 %) in 12 patients, there were 8 port displacements or tubing breaks (7 %), 2 elective <b>explantations</b> (2 %), 2 cases of gastric prolapse (2 %), 1 gastric pouch dilatation (1 %), 1 port abscess (1 %), and 1 hemorrhage (1 %).

Among them endograft infection is a rare but devastating occurrence, accounting for an incidence ranging from 0. 2 % to 0. 7 % in major series, and almost 1 % of all causes of endograft <b>explantations.</b> However, a real estimation of the incidence of the problem respect to the number of EVAR implantations is difficult to obtain. Time to infection is usually defined as the period between EVAR and presentation of symptoms that leads to the infection diagnosis. It can be extremely variable, depending on bacterial virulence and host conditions. The diagnosis of an endograft infection is usually based on a combination of clinical symptoms, imaging studies and microbial cultures whenever possible. If computed tomography (CT) scan is employed in almost 100 % of infection diagnosis, a combination of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT scan is nowadays used with increasing frequency in order to rise the likelihood of detecting a graft infection, since even cultures of blood or samples collected from the infected field can sometimes be negative. Complete graft excision seems the best approach whenever a surgical reconstruction could be attempted. In situ reconstruction can be performed by the interposition of an autologous vein, a cryopreserved allograft or a rifampin-soaked Dacron graft. The so-called conventional treatment contemplates the re-establishment of vascularization through extranatomical routes, thus preserving the new graft material from possible contamination by the surgical field just cleaned. When severe comorbid conditions did not allow graft excision, a conservative treatment should be taken into account. It is mainly based on broad-spectrum or culture-specific antibiotic therapy combined, whenever possible, with percutaneous drainage of the infectious cavity or aneurismal sac followed by irrigation with saline and antibiotic solutions. New techniques of percutaneous drainage under CT scan guidance can allow expedite collection of fluid material for microbial culture or fluid drainage, catheter positioning to collect infectious material from the cavity and perform irrigation of the infected field or injection of iodine contrast when the suspicion of aortoenteric fistula exists...|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{population}} consisted {{of patients with}} an isolated acetabular revision due to recurrent dislocation of their THA. Most previous reports show comparable favorable results [13 – 18]. Langlais et al. [13] reviewed the results of 88 isolated acetabular revisions (82 patients {{at high risk of}} dislocation) using cemented dual mobility cups with a mean follow-up of 3  years (range 2 – 5  years). There was one dislocation (1.1  %) and survival was 94.6  % (two cases of aseptic loosening). Götze et al. [14] described their experience with an acetabular or total hip revision with a dual mobility cup (as used in our study) in 27 patients with a high risk of dislocation (14 cases) or a history of recurrent dislocation (13 cases). At a mean follow-up of one and a half years, there had been one dislocation of the polyethylene liner and the implant survival rate was 100  %. Leiber-Wackenheim et al. [15] {{are one of the few}} who reported on a series of isolated acetabular revisions with an uncemented dual mobility cup in a group of 59 patients with a history of recurrent dislocations. There was one early dislocation without recurrence after a mean follow-up of 8  years. All implants survived, and no component <b>explantations</b> were required. Civinini et al. [16] performed a prospective study of 33 patients (33 hips) with isolated acetabular revision with a dual mobility implant as used in the current study. Indication for revision was aseptic loosening (32 cases) or malposition of the cup (one case). At a mean follow-up of 3  years, no dislocations had occurred and survival rates were 97  % (95  % CI 82 – 98). Philippot et al. [17] showed the results of 163 acetabular revisions with a dual mobility cup. At a mean follow-up of 5  years, there were six cases (3.7  %) of dislocation and two cases of acetabular loosening; cup survival was 96.1  % (95  % CI 93 – 99). Recently, Hailer et al. [18] identified 228 THA cup revisions from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register in patients with persistent dislocations with a dual mobility component as used in our study. They were only able to detect re-operations. At 2 -year follow-up, they observed a survival of 99  % (95  % CI 97 – 100) based on dislocation and 93  % (95  % CI 90 – 97) based on the revision rate for any reason.|$|R
