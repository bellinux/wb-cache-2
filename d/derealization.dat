5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, <b>derealization,</b> hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and <b>derealization</b> phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged <b>derealization</b> (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, <b>derealization</b> and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
25|$|Meditation {{may induce}} {{psychological}} side effects, including depersonalization, <b>derealization</b> and psychotic symptoms like hallucinations {{as well as}} mood disturbances.|$|E
25|$|As NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, dextrorphan and dextromethorphan {{inhibit the}} excitatory amino acid and neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. This can effectively slow, or even shut down certain neural pathways, preventing {{areas of the}} brain from communicating with each other. This leaves the user feeling dissociated or disconnected, experienced as brain fog or <b>derealization.</b>|$|E
25|$|KLS can be {{diagnosed}} {{when there is}} confusion, apathy, or <b>derealization</b> in addition to frequent bouts of extreme tiredness and prolonged sleep. The earliest it can {{be diagnosed}} is the second episode, this is not common. The condition is generally treated as a diagnosis of exclusion. Because KLS is rare, other conditions with similar symptoms are usually considered first.|$|E
25|$|Chronic encephalomyelitis, {{which may}} be progressive, can involve {{cognitive}} impairment, brain fog, migraines, balance issues, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, vertigo, and back pain. In rare cases, untreated Lyme disease may cause frank psychosis, which has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; also, delusional behavior may be seen, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or <b>derealization</b> syndrome, where the patients begin to feel detached from themselves or from reality.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{appetite}} (hyperphagia) {{and unusual}} cravings {{are present in}} half to two thirds of cases. About half of patients, mainly male patients, experience dramatically increased sexual urges (hypersexuality). Several other symptoms usually accompany the syndrome, including marked changes in mood and cognitive ability. <b>Derealization</b> and severe apathy are present in at least 80 percent of cases. About one third of patients experience hallucinations or delusions. Depression and anxiety occur less commonly; one study found them in about 25 percent of patients. Individuals usually cannot remember what happened during episodes. Repetitive behaviors and headaches are commonly reported. Some patients act very childlike during episodes, and communication skills and coordination sometimes suffer.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that chronic {{administration}} of diazepam or bromazepam causes a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased turnover of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin, increased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased levels of the catecholamines. During withdrawal of bromazepam or diazepam a fall in tryptophan, serotonin levels occurs as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Changes in the levels of these chemicals in the brain can cause headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, <b>derealization,</b> depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia.|$|E

2500|$|At {{anesthetic}} doses, under-dosaged from {{a medical}} point of view, ketamine produces a dissociative state, characterised {{by a sense of}} detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and <b>derealization.</b> At sufficiently high doses, users may experience what is called the [...] "K-hole", a state of extreme dissociation with visual and auditory hallucinations. John C. Lilly, Marcia Moore and D. M. Turner (amongst others) have written extensively about their own entheogenic use of, and psychonautic experiences with ketamine. Both Moore and Turner died prematurely (due to hypothermia and drowning respectively) during presumed unsupervised ketamine use.|$|E
2500|$|Cannabis also {{produces}} many subjective and highly tangible effects, such as greater enjoyment of food taste and aroma, an enhanced enjoyment {{of music and}} comedy, and marked distortions {{in the perception of}} time and space (where experiencing a [...] "rush" [...] of ideas from the bank of long-term memory can create the subjective impression of long elapsed time, while in reality only a short time has passed). At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory and/or visual illusions, pseudohallucinations, and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to dissociative states such as depersonalization and <b>derealization.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Daytime reemergence and rebound {{withdrawal}} symptoms, {{sometimes called}} interdose withdrawal, may occur once dependence has set in. Reemergence is {{the return of}} symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed, in contrast, rebound symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken for, but at a more intense level than before. Withdrawal symptoms, on the other hand, may appear {{for the first time}} during dose reduction, and include insomnia, anxiety, distress, weight loss, panic, depression, <b>derealization,</b> and paranoia, and are more commonly associated with short-acting benzodiazepines discontinuation, like triazolam. [...] Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepine use or z-drugs such as zopiclone; withdrawal-related insomnia rebounds worse than baseline even when benzodiazepines are used intermittently.|$|E
2500|$|The {{key to the}} {{induction}} is that the exercises should mimic the most frightening symptoms of a panic attack. [...] Symptom inductions should be repeated {{three to five times}} per day until the patient has little to no anxiety in relation to the symptoms that were induced. [...] Often it will take a period of weeks for the afflicted to feel no anxiety in relation to the induced symptoms. [...] With repeated trials, a person learns through experience that these internal sensations {{do not need to be}} feared and becomes less sensitized or desensitized to the internal sensation. [...] After repeated trials, when nothing catastrophic happens, the brain learns (hippocampus and amygdala) to not fear the sensations, and the sympathetic nervous system activation fades. [...] However, in real-life situations panic may escalate independently of whether the subject is fearful of the minor symptoms associated with panic. [...] The subject may have no fear of fast heart rate, hyperventilation or <b>derealization,</b> but may nevertheless feel terror, and it is the terror that may cause the other symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Depersonalization is a {{subjective}} experience of unreality in one's self, while <b>derealization</b> is unreality {{of the outside}} world. Although most authors currently regard depersonalization (self) and <b>derealization</b> (surroundings) as independent constructs, many {{do not want to}} separate <b>derealization</b> from depersonalization.|$|E
50|$|People {{experiencing}} <b>derealization</b> describe {{feeling as}} if they are viewing the world through a TV screen. This, and other similar feelings attendant to <b>derealization,</b> can cause a sensation of alienation and distance between the person suffering from <b>derealization</b> and others around them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Derealization</b> is a {{subjective}} experience of unreality {{of the outside}} world, while depersonalization is sense of unreality in one's personal self, although most authors currently do not regard <b>derealization</b> (surroundings) and depersonalization (self) as separate constructs.|$|E
50|$|Cannabis, psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants, caffeine, nitrous oxide, albuterol, and {{nicotine}} can all produce feelings resembling <b>derealization,</b> {{particularly when}} taken in excess. It {{can result from}} alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal can also cause feelings of <b>derealization.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Derealization</b> can {{accompany}} the neurological conditions of epilepsy (particularly temporal lobe epilepsy), migraine, and mild head injury. There is a similarity between visual hypo-emotionality, a reduced emotional response to viewed objects, and <b>derealization.</b> This suggests {{a disruption of}} {{the process by which}} perception becomes emotionally coloured. This qualitative change in the experiencing of perception may lead to reports of anything viewed being unreal or detached.|$|E
50|$|Vestibular {{dysfunction}} {{has also}} been found to correlate with cognitive and emotional disorders, including depersonalization and <b>derealization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interoceptive {{exposure}} {{can be used}} as a {{means to}} induce <b>derealization,</b> as well as the related phenomenon depersonalization.|$|E
5000|$|The {{detachment}} of <b>derealization</b> {{can be described}} as an immaterial substance that separates a person from the outside world, such as a sensory fog, pane of glass, or veil. Individuals may report that what they see lacks vividness and emotional coloring. Emotional response to visual recognition of loved ones may be significantly reduced. Feelings of déjà vu or jamais vu are common. Familiar places may look alien, bizarre, and surreal. The world as perceived by the individual may feel like it is going through a dolly zoom effect. Such perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste, and smell. The degree of familiarity one has with their surroundings is among one's sensory and psychological identity, memory foundation and history when experiencing a place. When a person {{is in a state of}} <b>derealization,</b> they block this identifying foundation from recall. This [...] "blocking effect" [...] creates a discrepancy of correlation between one's perception of one's surroundings during a <b>derealization</b> episode, and what that same individual would perceive in the absence of a <b>derealization</b> episode.|$|E

50|$|Naltrexone is {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} treatment of dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization and <b>derealization.</b> Some studies suggest it might help. Other small, preliminary studies have also shown benefit. It is thought that blockade of the KOR by naltrexone and naloxone is responsible for their effectiveness in ameliorating depersonalization and <b>derealization.</b> Since these drugs are less efficacious in blocking the KOR relative to the MOR, higher dose than typically used seem to be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Depersonalization {{disorder}} (DPD), {{also known}} as depersonalization-derealization syndrome, is a mental disorder in which the person has persistent or recurrent feelings of depersonalization and/or <b>derealization.</b> Symptoms can be classified as either depersonalization or <b>derealization.</b> Depersonalization is described as feeling disconnected or estranged from one's self. Individuals experiencing depersonalization may report feeling {{as if they are}} an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions. In some cases, individuals may be unable to accept their reflection as their own, or they may have out-of-body experiences. While depersonalization is a sense of detachment from one's self, <b>derealization</b> is described as detachment from one's surroundings. Individuals experiencing <b>derealization</b> may report perceiving the world around them as foggy, dreamlike/surreal, or visually distorted. In addition to these depersonalization-derealization disorder symptoms, the inner turmoil created by the disorder can result in depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, panic attacks, phobias, etc. It can also cause a variety of physical symptoms, including chest pain, blurry vision, visual snow, nausea, and the sensation of pins and needles in one's arms or legs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Derealization</b> {{can also}} be a symptom of severe sleep {{disorders}} and mental disorders like depersonalization disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, and anxiety disorders.|$|E
