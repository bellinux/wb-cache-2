Gewertz states that as far back in history as there is evidence (1850s) Chambri men dominated over the women, controlled their produce and made all important political decisions. In later years there has been a <b>diligent</b> <b>search</b> for societies in which women dominate men, or for signs of such past societies, but none have been found (Bamberger, 1974).|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1608, she was canonized by Pope Paul V, {{and in the}} {{following}} decades a <b>diligent</b> <b>search</b> was made for her remains, which had been hidden due to the troubled times in which she lived. Her body was found incorrupt some months after her death. Her grave was identified on April 2, 1638, (but this time only the bones remained), and her remains were reburied in the Church of Santa Maria Nova on March 9, 1649, which since then has been her feast day. Again, in 1869, her body was exhumed and has since then been displayed in a glass coffin for the veneration of the faithful. The Church of Santa Maria Nova is now usually {{referred to as the}} Church of St. Frances.|$|E
500|$|Upon its publication, The Shortest Way {{provoked}} {{immediate and}} passionate reactions {{from both sides}} of the debate. Some made use of it as a genuine vindication of the anti-Dissenter opinion, although speculation later occurred over whether it was ironic. The pamphlet generated a great deal of publicity over the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry. This resulted in the issuing of a warrant by the High Tory Secretary of State for the Southern Department, the Earl of Nottingham, for the arrest of Defoe on the charge of seditious libel, the order being given to [...] "… make Strict and <b>diligent</b> <b>Search</b> for Daniel Fooe and him having found you are to apprehend and seize together with his Papers for high Crime and misdemeanours and to bring him before me …" ...|$|E

500|$|The 1760s saw {{a growth}} in the {{intensity}} of litigation against state officers, who, using general warrants, conducted raids in search of materials relating to John Wilkes's publications attacking both government policies and the King himself. The most famous of these cases involved John Entick, whose home was forcibly entered by the King's Messenger Nathan Carrington, along with others, pursuant to a warrant issued by George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax authorizing them [...] "to make strict and <b>diligent</b> <b>search</b> for... the author, or one concerned {{in the writing of}} several weekly very seditious papers entitled, 'The Monitor or British Freeholder, No 257, 357, 358, 360, 373, 376, 378, and 380,'" [...] and seized printed charts, pamphlets and other materials. Entick filed suit in Entick v Carrington, argued before the Court of King's Bench in 1765. Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden ruled that both the search and the seizure were unlawful, as the warrant authorized the seizure of all of Entick's papers—not just the criminal ones—and as the warrant lacked probable cause to even justify the search. By holding that [...] "ur law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close without his leave", Entick established the English precedent that the executive is limited in intruding on private property by common law.|$|E

50|$|For the {{millions}} of older copyrighted works of less enduring popularity, it is difficult, or impossible, to trace the copyright ownership and determine who holds the particular rights {{that would have to}} be licensed for the use of the work. The problem of such orphan works stems from the extension of copyright term and the lack of requirement for the copyright owner to renew or register their copyright. In order to tackle this perceived problem some jurisdictions have revised their copyright laws to allow use of orphaned works, after <b>diligent</b> <b>searches.</b>|$|R

By <b>diligent</b> <b>searching</b> he was able to gather the many details which he has embodied in his Introduction to the eulogy, and the publishers have gladly coöperated with him for the preservation of all the material in a worthy and attractive form.|$|R
50|$|The Chemung River, a {{tributary}} of the Susquehanna River, flows through the southern portion of the town. Sing Sing Creek flows {{through the center of the}} town and is a {{tributary of}} the Chemung. The geography consists of a broad expanse of relatively flat land, the axis of which lies generally northeast to southwest. It is a river valley. The land has historically been very good for agriculture, including tobacco. <b>Diligent</b> <b>searching</b> will result in the finding of fossil seashells indicating the land was an ancient sea bottom. Other evidence is found in the rock of the region, which is mostly shale. The western town line is the border of Steuben County.|$|R

60|$|Astronomy {{teaches the}} correct {{use of the}} sun and the planets. These may be put on a frame of little sticks and turned round. This causes the tides. Those at the ends of the sticks are {{enormously}} far away. From time to time a <b>diligent</b> <b>searching</b> of the sticks reveals new planets. The orbit of a planet is the distance the stick goes round in going round. Astronomy is intensely interesting; it should be done at night, in a high tower in Spitzbergen. This is to avoid the astronomy being interrupted. A really good astronomer can tell when a comet is coming too near him by the warning buzz of the revolving sticks.|$|R

40|$|We {{strongly}} support the proposed exception to allow text and data mining for non-commercial research. The current situation, in which researchers must gain permissions from individual publishers to mine content {{to which they}} already have legal access, prevents the effective use of these tools, and threatens to limit drastically the significant potential economic and societal benefits that could be gained. We agree with the proposals {{to establish a system}} to register and authorise the use of orphan works – such a system, in particular the requirement to conduct <b>diligent</b> <b>searches</b> for rights holders, must be proportionate and recognise that archival material should not be held to the same standards as published works. We support the proposals to extend the exceptions in relation to library preservation and on usage for research and private study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to present a simple formula for {{the area of the}} medial {{parallelogram}} of a tetrahedron in terms of the lengths of the six edges, together with its derivation. It is not claimed that this formula is original, though <b>diligent</b> <b>searches</b> of standard sources of mensuration formulae, and inquiries to mathematicians in a variety of fields suggest that it is not generally known, and may be new. The author would be grateful for any references to previously published instances of this formula. Despite the very classical nature of the problem it solves, there is some serious contemporary interest arising from recently proposed simplicial models for quantum gravity (cf. [1], [2]), in which such a formula is needed to approach the problem of length operators. Consider a tetrahedron with edge-lengths as in Figure 1. Fix a pair of nonincident edges, say those of lengths d and e. It is then easy to see that the midpoints of the remaining four edges lie in a plane parallel to both of the chosen edges, and equidistant from the planes containing each chosen edge an...|$|R

40|$|Despite much {{scholarly}} {{interest and}} a great deal of <b>diligent</b> <b>searching,</b> the corpus of texts by early-modern women writers remains small. Anne Lock?s (Lok, Vaughan) short sonnet sequence, The Meditation of a Penitent Sinner (1560), has its own intrinsic claims for attention: it is, for instance, the first sonnet sequence written in English. However, as a work by a woman, it has become a focal point for a small industry of critics writing about its implications for work on women?s textual communities, their medical practice (it displays familiarity with medical terminology), and the relationship between a woman?s social status and her writing: Lock, unlike many of the prominent female authors of her day, belonged to the mercantile classes rather than the court. It is thus potentially a blow to women?s studies to find (in an MS marginal note which has not, to my knowledge, been discussed in print) that the first of Lock?s sonnets appears in a late-sixteenth-century Scottish psalter (BL MUS Add. 33933) with an inscription which associates the text, not with Lock, but with a man: Christopher Goodman, the Protestant preacher, friend of John Knox, and client of the Sidneys. Since Lock notoriously did not claim the authorship of the sonnets (she says they were ?geven [her] by a frend?, a statement usually interpreted as a modesty trope), this reference to Goodman seems to offer a solution for her failure to claim the sonnets as her own. This essay explores the authorship of the sonnets, and offers an explanation to the mystery posed by Lock?s attribution of the text to the unknown ?frend?...|$|R
