5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> {{thought to}} be a simple {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} sweet orange carrot was not {{developed}} until the 16th century, in the Low Countries, {{it has been}} represented as a tradition, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> customary for English people to eat Crécy soup annually on 26 August in commemoration of {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Crécy, which occurred in Crécy, France on that date in 1346.|$|E

5|$|Among {{women living}} closely together, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> {{thought that the}} onsets of {{menstruation}} tend to synchronize. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly explained {{by the action of}} pheromones in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy, {{even in its}} fourteenth season, is ABC's highest-rated drama. While its {{ratings have}} fallen {{over the course of}} its run (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> among the overall top 10 shows in the United States), it {{is still one of the}} highest-rated shows among the 18–49 demographic, and the No. 3 drama on all of {{broadcast}} television.|$|E
5|$|The Black House, a local landmark, {{stands at}} the end of the spit, {{opposite}} Mudeford Quay, site of the Battle of Mudeford in 1784. Built in 1848, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> a boat-builders' house, but is now rented out to holidaymakers. It has served a variety of functions over the years, and is commonly (but inaccurately) associated with the area's smuggling past.|$|E

5|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{implementation}} of various legislation {{over the following}} decade allowed many counties to vastly improve roads under their jurisdiction. By the time the Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway3 in Tillsonburg to Highway2 in Ingersoll on March12, 1930 as King's Highway19, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> again a gravel road.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a {{language}} isolate. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> {{assumed to be}} a member of the adjacent Gunwinyguan family that stretches from Arnhem Land, throughout Kakadu National Park and South to Katherine; however, there was considerable debate about the status of Wagiman within the Gunwinyguan family.|$|E

5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E

5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> {{part of a}} great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
5|$|Composed of a torso, the Maxberg Specimen (S5) was {{discovered}} in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it {{was brought to the}} attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became insolvent again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At {{roughly the same}} time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening {{may have been the}} result of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm in an attempt to deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day. At this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there does not appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E
