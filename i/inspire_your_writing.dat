40|$|What {{academics}} or {{books have}} <b>inspired</b> you in <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> and research, or {{helped to make}} sense of the world around you? In this feature essay, Ninna Meier returns to her experience of reading Hannah Arendt as she sought to understand work and how it relates to value production in capitalist economies. Meier recounts how Arendt’s book On Revolution (1963) forged connective threads between the ‘smallest parts’ and the ‘largest wholes’ and showed how academic work is never fully relegated to the past, but can return in new iterations across time...|$|R
40|$|Our theatre {{tradition}} {{has a long}} history where men have written most of the plays. If we want that the theatre should be a place, which should be built as much around womens experience as mens experiences, how can we relate to the canon? This is a study based on questions around our theatre tradition. Three women dramatists have been asked questions like: What {{do you think about the}} classics? About the women roles? Do the classics <b>inspire</b> you, in <b>your</b> <b>writing?</b> Is there a difference in being a female dramatist than being a male dramatist? Femi-nist theatre- theories have been used to guide us through the canon. Through the answers and reflection I have found that women writers still feel locked up in their sex, they always have to deal with the fact of being first of all women. The study has also given some answers about their relation to the classics and the women roles in them. We shall also see that it is a possi-ble connection between the canon and some patriarchal conservative theatre institutions...|$|R

40|$|How do {{you keep}} {{yourself}} on the writing path? Writing requires persistence and determination. Writing is a lonely task. Who are you accountable to when you are writing? First, you are accountable to yourself. Only you know what <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> goals are. You set the goals; you monitor the accomplishment of the goals. How clear are you about establishing <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> goals? Do you write everyday? Do you write on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Do you write in two-hour blocks {{or do you have}} the luxury of taking a whole day or more for writing? Do you make a list of <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> goals and publish them prominently? Do you review the goal list daily? Second, you may be accountable to a publisher or an editor. Deadlines are a great asset to goal achievement. Working to meet a deadline is a powerful inducement to productivity. Third, have you shared <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> goals with others? If you announce your goals to others, they will remind you of your commitments. Fourth, are you a member of a writing group? If you meet regularly with others who are committed to writing, the focus on writing may help you meet <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> goals. A writing group provides an opportunity to share your goals and report on your progress in meeting the goals. Goal specificity and a steady focus on the goals are essential to <b>your</b> <b>writing</b> success...|$|R

The environment you work in is important for developing good writing habits and enabling you to write well, so the chapter discusses how you can create <b>your</b> own <b>writing</b> den and find <b>your</b> favourite <b>writing</b> haunts.
