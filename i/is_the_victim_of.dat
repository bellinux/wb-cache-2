25|$|Arguing that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a {{miscarriage}} of justice, Bamber has repeatedly applied {{to have his}} conviction overturned or his sentence reduced. He {{does not have the}} support of his extended family, who were involved in gathering the evidence that saw him convicted and who remain convinced of his guilt. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case to the Court of Appeal in 2001, which upheld the conviction in 2002. The CCRC rejected further applications from Bamber in 2004 and 2012. In July 2013 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in Bamber's favour that there must be a possibility, for whole-life prisoners, of review and release.|$|E

25|$|For years, Turner {{has engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of intimidation against public officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner’s arrest in this case failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation against a key witness in the government’s case against him. All the while, Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his innumerable victims – that is, except when he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a perceived threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in witness intimidation, lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|The European Union (EU) {{signed a}} {{comprehensive}} package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16December 2002. With this agreement, the EU {{was given the}} possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, {{on the condition that}} NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called [...] "right of first refusal". For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that [...] "If a Member State <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power". The treaty applies globally to specified territories whereas NATO is restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer. It provides a [...] "double framework" [...] for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme.|$|E

Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the RSPCA Australia or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care.

2500|$|Romantic {{suspense}} {{involves an}} intrigue or mystery for the protagonists to solve. Typically, however, the heroine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a crime or attempted crime, {{and works with}} a hero, who tends {{to be in a}} field where he would serve as a protector, such as a police officer, FBI agent, bodyguard, or Navy SEAL. By the end of the novel, the mystery is resolved and the interaction between the hero and heroine has evolved into a solid relationship. [...] These novels primarily take place in contemporary times, but authors such as Amanda Quick have broadened the genre to also include historical timeframes.|$|E

2500|$|Regina v Armel Gnango [...] is {{the leading}} English {{criminal}} law case on the interaction of joint enterprise, transferred malice, and exemption from criminal liability where a party to what would normally be a crime <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> it. The Supreme Court held, restoring Gnango's conviction {{for the murder of}} Magda Pniewska, that he was guilty of murder notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} not fired the shot which killed Pniewska during the shoot out which led to her death, and that the fatal shot had been fired by his opponent in an attempt to kill him. The judgment of the Supreme Court has been criticised over the extent to which it was designed to mollify public opinion, and in the context of ongoing debates over the nature of the doctrine of joint enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|In October, a {{grand jury}} began {{examining}} the case, calling 95 witnesses and amassing 975 pages of testimony. Mrs. Crater refused to appear. The conclusion was that [...] "the evidence is insufficient to warrant any expression of opinion as to whether Crater is alive or dead, or {{as to whether he}} has absented himself voluntarily, or is the sufferer from disease in the nature of amnesia, or <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> crime". At the time, some theorized that he had left town with another woman or fled to avoid revelations of corruption, but the case's extensive publicity would have made it virtually impossible for Crater to have begun a new life somewhere else. Six months after his disappearance, Crater's wife found envelopes in a dresser drawer containing money and a note from the judge. The discovery led to a number of new but ultimately inconclusive leads, and no trace of him was ever found. [...] Crater's wife said that he had been murdered. The case was officially closed in 1979.|$|E
