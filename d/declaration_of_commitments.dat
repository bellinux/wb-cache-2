40|$|Refugees in {{prolonged}} {{states of}} exile remain neglected and {{excluded from the}} international political agenda, in particular refugee women. This research attempts {{to solve this problem}} by focusing on HIV/AIDS as a security threat to this group. It recognizes a synergy between protracted displacement, gender and HIV/AIDS and examines the marginalization of refugee women and how this contributes to their vulnerability to infection. This is done by analysing the degree to which host states, Kenya and Tanzania acting as case studies, comply with their international commitments, especially the 2001 UNGASS <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> on HIV/AIDS, in their National Strategic plans for HIV/AIDS and by examining their responses to the socio-economic factors of vulnerability. It also analyses the role played by the international refugee regime, in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It looks at how vulnerability to infection can be mitigated amongst refugee women. Key findings include that refugees in protracted states of displacement are marginalized by the host state due to their legal status as refugees and are neglected within the host states’ National Strategic Plans on HIV/AIDS and that inadequate levels of compliance to the relevant instruments of international law, in particular the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commitment</b> on HIV/AIDS, has resulted in host states failing refugee women...|$|R

40|$|Objective,To {{evaluate}} a smoking cessation intervention {{that can be}} routinely delivered to smokers admitted with cardiac problems. Design, Randomised controlled trial of usual care compared with intervention delivered on hospital wards by cardiac rehabilitation nurses. Setting, Inpatient wards in 17 hospitals in England. Participants, 540 smokers admitted to hospital after myocardial infarction or for cardiac bypass surgery who expressed interest in stopping smoking. Intervention, Brief verbal advice and standard booklet (usual care). Intervention lasting 20 - 30 minutes including carbon monoxide reading, special booklet, quiz, contact with other people giving up, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to give up, sticker in patient's notes (intervention group). Main outcome measures, Continuous abstinence at six weeks and 12 months determined by self report and by biochemical validation at these end points. Feasibility of the intervention and delivery of its components. Results, After six weeks 151 (59 %) and 159 (60 %) patients remained abstinent in the control and intervention group, respectively (P= 0. 84). After 12 months the figures were 102 (41 %) and 94 (37 %) (P= 0. 40). Recruitment was slow, and delivery of the intervention was inconsistent, raising concerns about the feasibility of the intervention within routine care. Patients who received the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> component were almost {{twice as likely to}} remain abstinent {{than those who did not}} receive it. Low dependence on tobacco and high motivation to give up were the main independent predictors of positive outcome. Patients who had had bypass surgery were over twice as likely to return to smoking as patients who had had a myocardial infarction. Conclusions, Single session interventions delivered within routine care may have insufficient power to influence highly dependent smokers...|$|R

However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion.
