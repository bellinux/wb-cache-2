500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money is invested in the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E

2500|$|Universal Motown Records, Bell's label at the time, was {{hesitant}} to release an album {{that had no}} contribution from its musicians and producers, but Bell said it only took one song to convince them to release it. Bell also said: [...] ""I think having <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> would feel false. I felt capable {{that we could get}} it done, and we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Wildes from The Christian Manifesto lavished praise {{upon the}} album's unorthodox {{production}} and theologically deep, highly skilled lyricism. He wrote that [...] "it's {{hard to talk}} about such a creative album and do it the justice it deserves", and commented of the album's production that [...] "Talking about organic, your mother's favorite gardening tools can be heard making rhythms and beats on this number." [...] Christian Music Zine's Anthony Peronto praised the chemistry and group dynamic between Beautiful Eulogy's three members. He concluded that With nary a flaw to be found and undeniable growth by each member, Beautiful Eulogy have exceeded all expectations and delivered their best work yet. Though I want to resist repeating my thoughts on Beautiful Eulogy's debut album I can't say <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> than this slight paraphrasing: This is the most musically creative hip hop album I've heard since, well... Satellite Kite. Jessica Cooper of Indie Vision Music summarized that All of Instruments of Mercy is fresh in sound, featuring loops of new beats and sounds that stick to the lyrics like glue. Beautiful Eulogy continues to be consistent in their collaborative works and are undoubtedly blessed with the words and musical talent to produce something that's cohesive, poetic, and undeniably beautiful from beginning to end. Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice praised the rapping skills of Odd Thomas and Braille, Courtland Urbano's production, and the lyrical focus of the album. He remarked that [...] "It is hard not to marvel at the sheer talent of these three individuals, whether {{it is in the}} crisp vocals, wonderful production, or the dense and theologically provoking lyrics." ...|$|E

60|$|THE POETRY OF POE. Most {{people read}} Poe's poetry for the melody {{that is in}} it.

I was at Coney Island when I went to New York once, and one of them down-hill skidding apparatuses they call 'roller-coasters' flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack-suit.

60|$|Well, after a great {{search for}} what was best and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose {{judgment}} in such affairs was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for it. To this day I cannot tell {{the name of the}} tree, nor describe <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> than only by saying, that it is like what we call fustic, or between that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour and smell. But though my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I shewed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this boat; but I then told him how he might do it with tools, learning him at the same time how to use them, which indeed he did very dexterously; so that in a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease imaginable.|$|E
