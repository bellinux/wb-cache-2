5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I <b>have</b> <b>just</b> listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E

5|$|The jack jumper ant genome is {{contained}} {{on a single}} pair of chromosomes (males <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 alleles.|$|E

All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E

During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who <b>have</b> <b>just</b> finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E

Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might <b>have</b> <b>just</b> a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they <b>have</b> <b>just</b> chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of Avatar, {{taking place in the}} future, Krusty the Clown sends the {{military}} force to the planet Rigel 7 to find the a sacred extract Hilarrium, so he can easily entertain his Nazi audience. The military recruits Bart and Milhouse to befriend the alien race in avatar bodies. They succeed in this and Bart ends up getting Kang's daughter pregnant after falling in love with her. They learn that the extract Hilarrium, which is excreted by their queen, is primarily used by the natives to reduce the mood swings of pregnant women. Milhouse then contacts the military of their location, which then attacks the natives. In the battle, the natives are helped by all the animals of the planet, which eventually defeats the military. Kang and Kodos then admit that they would <b>have</b> <b>just</b> given the Hilarrium to the humans.|$|E

Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall.

Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
