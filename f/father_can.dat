5|$|Chuck and Hartley go to Volkoff Industries, and Hartley reveals to Vivian {{that he went}} {{undercover}} voluntarily, {{resulting in}} his transformation into the villainous Volkoff. Chuck gives up the discs from Casey so Vivian and her <b>father</b> <b>can</b> start a new life. Chuck returns with the antidote to Burbank, California, where Decker is waiting for him. A standoff occurs, but as Chuck is backed up by a superior force made up of his friends, family, the C.A.T. Squad (Mini Andén and Mercedes Masöhn), and Volkoff's Spetsnaz paratroopers, Decker is forced to stand down. Using the information about Alexei as leverage against Decker, Chuck delivers the antidote.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her <b>father</b> <b>can</b> take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|The Historia syntomos of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople {{mentions}} {{a single}} brother of Heraclius the Elder, named Gregoras, {{who was the}} father of Nicetas. Theophanes the Confessor mentions Epiphania as the mother of Emperor Heraclius, thus wife of Heraclius the Elder. Heraclius the Elder is mentioned as the father of Emperor Heraclius in several sources, including Theophylact, John of Nikiû, Nikephoros I, Theophanes, Agapius the historian, the Suda, Georgios Kedrenos, Joannes Zonaras, Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 1234 and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos. In contrast, there is no source mentioning him in the same sentence as the siblings of Emperor Heraclius. That he was their <b>father</b> <b>can</b> be safely assumed though.|$|E

Morgan has {{to get close to}} Killian to get closer to Ciaran so she called Killian to Widow's Vale and asked him to contact Ciaran. She feels apprehensive and hesitant about facing Ciaran, but at the same time, has a strange urge to hug him since she has finally found her true father.

Near the end of the book, she shape shifts into a wolf, with Ciaran, and learns his true name, which can control him. Morgan is faced with a choice between the people she loves and the powerful and seemingly dark magick her <b>father</b> <b>can</b> teach her.|$|E

Morgan Freeman, an actor known for his narration work, conducts a reading in the episode of Butters' second book, The Poop That Took a Pee.

Stan learns from a news report that the object is a superconducting magnet, stolen from the Large Hadron Collider by Randy disguised as Princess Leia. During the finals, Randy coaxes Stan to lie to the judges and say he used only the parts in the approved pinewood derby kit. Stan wins first place when his car reaches warp speed, shooting off the track and into space, where it is later found by an alien species. Soon after, a spaceship lands in South Park, but its pilot is a bank robber named [...] "Baby Fark McGee-zax" [...] who demands that Stan and Randy build him a new warp drive while holding the entire planet at gunpoint.

500|$|Writing for Newsday, {{television}} critic Tom Carson stated he {{felt the}} episode was [...] "a really plaintive story about craving something, anything, to hold onto", as Cartman tries to adapt the culture of each man he believes to be his father. Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, {{author of the book}} Taking South Park Seriously, also felt the episode was a good example of a [...] "kind of equivalency between ethnic, racial and sexual identities", but felt [...] "the humor lies partly in Cartman's parody of mass culture's stereotypes of Native Americans and African Americans". In his book American politics and society today, Robert Singh noted that the episode gives the most prominent example of how Cartman's rude behaviour is the result of being raised without a father. This correlated with a theory by Paul Cantor, author of the book The Simpsons: Atomistic Politics and the Nuclear Family, regarding Homer Simpson, of FOX's The Simpsons, [...] "that merely by being present, a dutiful and attached <b>father</b> <b>can</b> provide a meaningful influence, despite his dysfunctional behaviour and errant educational ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|Experiencing a {{miscarriage}} [...] "is a major loss for all pregnant women." [...] A miscarriage {{can result in}} anxiety, depression or stress for those involved. The impact on a woman life can be underestimated. It can have an affect on the whole family. Almost all those experiencing {{a miscarriage}} go through a grieving process. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may {{go through the same}} loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realization of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The <b>father</b> <b>can</b> have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult.|$|E
