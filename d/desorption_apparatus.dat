50|$|The {{choice of}} inlet type and {{injection}} technique depends on if {{the sample is}} in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present {{that has to be}} vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus</b> such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the injector (SPME applications).|$|E
30|$|Phase purities of the as-prepared {{samples were}} {{characterized}} using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D 8 advanced diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, λ[*]=[*] 1.5406  Å). The sizes and morphologies {{of the samples}} were investigated using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S- 4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H 7700, 120  kV). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL- 2010) with an accelerating voltage of 200  kV. The surface information as well as chemical composition of the samples were examined using the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS, ESCALAB 250). The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption and <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus</b> (Quantachrome autosorb IQ-C).|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{in the analysis}} of explosives is demonstrated. A sensitive, rapid, solventless and inexpensive method for the analysis of explosives and explosive odors from solid and liquid samples has been optimized using SPME followed by HPLC and GC/ECD. SPME involves the extraction of the organic components in debris samples into sorbent-coated silica fibers, which can be transferred directly to the injector of a gas chromatograph. SPME/HPLC requires a special <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus</b> to elute the extracted analyte onto the column at high pressure. Re suits for use of GC[ECD is presented and compared to the results gathered by using HPLC analysis. The relative effects of controllable variables including fiber chemistry, adsorption and desorption temperature, extraction time, and desorption time have been optimized for various high explosives...|$|E
40|$|A new thermal <b>desorption</b> {{spectroscopy}} <b>apparatus</b> {{was used}} to study hydrogen in four martensitic advanced high-strength steels (designated MS 980, MS 1180, MS 1300 and MS 1500) after gaseous hydrogen charging, and after hydrogen charging electrochemically in 0. 1 M NaOH and in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl. The hydrogen concentration did not correlate strongly with steel strength. For MS 1500, a relationship was derived between equivalent hydrogen fugacity and the applied charging overpotential. Also for MS 1500, the trap binding energies were evaluated to be 26. 4 kJ mol− 1 and 61. 0 kJ mol− 1, which were interpreted as dislocation and interface hydrogen traps. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A compact {{apparatus}} {{based on}} universal detector with electron bombardment ionization has been constructed for surface photocatalytic dynamics. Extremely high vacuum (< 5 × 10 - 12 Torr) for the detector’s ionization region is achieved using multiple ultrahigh vacuum pumps. In {{addition to a}} home-made liquid nitrogen shielding and a turbomolecular pump, a simple and low-consumption titanium sublimation pump, rather than the complicated and high-consumption He cold head 1 is used to pump the detector’s ionization region with the high pumping speed for H 2. Therefore, the background H 2 in the detector can be considerablely reduced. This apparatus will be employed to quantitatively measure the products, like H 2 and H, from the surface reaction. A home-made quantitative molecular beam doser is also built 2 - 4, and {{will be used to}} acquire temperature program <b>desorption</b> spectra. The <b>apparatus</b> includes the standard surface science tools for preparation and characterization of surface samples, LEED, AES, ion gun and so on. This apparatus will be coupled to a set of femtosecond laser system to study the surface photocatalytic system, like water and methanol on TiO 2 (110) surfaces. 中国科学大连化学物理研究...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a High-Temperature Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometer (HT-PTR-MS) in which both the ion source and the ion drift tube can be continuously operated at temperatures up to 250 &deg;C. The instrument was characterized in a high E/N-mode (130 Td) and in a low E/N-mode (87 Td) at an operating temperature of 200 &deg;C. Instrumental sensitivities and 2 &sigma;-detection limits were {{on the order of}} 50 &ndash; 110 cps/ppb and 100 ppt (1 s signal integration time), respectively. The HT-PTR-MS is primarily intended for measuring "sticky" or semi-volatile trace gases. Alternatively, it may be coupled to a particle collection/thermal <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus</b> to measure particle-bound organics in near real-time. In view of these applications, we have measured instrumental response times for a series of reference compounds. 1 /e 2 -response times for dimethyl sulfoxide, ammonia and monoethanolamine were in the sub-second to second regime. 1 /e 2 -response times for levoglucosan, oxalic acid and cis-pinonic acid ranged from 8 to 370 s...|$|E
40|$|A new {{polymer matrix}} {{containing}} particulate silver {{has been developed}} for the introduction of analytes with low or negligible volatility into molecular beams via laser desorption. These silver-containing film matrices (SCFM) permit stable desorption to proceed for extended periods (ca. approximately 10 h) and have been applied successfully to the nondestructive volatilization {{of a number of}} amino acids and a transition-metal compound. Analytes can be extracted directly from solution onto the SCFM surface by simply dipping the film into the solution and then air-drying the film. The laser <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus,</b> when coupled to a supersonic molecular beam/laser ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, permits the detection of the analytes at femtogram levels. Furthermore, we have developed a reel-to-reel tape transport device that allows extended usage of the analyte-loaded SFCM, thereby permitting the measurement of wavelength-scanned mass-selected resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectra of analytes with low or negligible volatility. We demonstrate this application with the aromatic amino acids L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine. The degree of cooling achieved in the molecular expansion is shown to be comparable with that achieved using conventional beam sources, and the desorption yield is sufficiently stable for high-quality spectra to be measured...|$|E
40|$|Instrumentation {{development}} for ambient mass spectrometry is an ever-changing and ever-growing field, often emphasizing {{the development of}} field-portable, ruggedized instrumentation. This thesis presents work {{in the area of}} ion source development. Specifically, two novel ionizers for mass spectrometry are constructed, implemented, and tested on a variety of systems. The first, the ambient pressure pyroelectric ion source (APPIS) comprises a z-cut lithium niobate or lithium tantalate pyroelectric crystal which is subjected to thermal cycling. Thermal cycling and the pyroelectric effect result in the buildup of excess charge on the z-faces of the material. For a temperature change of only 30 K, an electrical potential as high as 70, 000 V could be built up if no discharging occurs. At ambient pressure, electrical discharges occur between the oppositely charged crystal faces and regions of different potentials on the same crystal face. Monitoring of the discharges using an inductive pickup reveals that the time frame of ion production corresponds to that of electrical activity on the crystal face. Additionally, the ions observed in the mass spectra differ when different ambient gas compositions are present. This, and comparison to APCI experiments reveals that ionization with APPIS is a gas phase process and observed product ion species are highly dependent on ambient gas composition. An application of APPIS, whereby APPIS is used as an ion source for the detection of chemical warfare agents, is presented. Agents in the V and G classes possess amine functionality, and as a result have relatively high proton affinities and are well suited to ionization and detection using chemical ionization with APPIS. Simulants for the nerve agents VX and Tabun were detected as singly protonated species using APPIS. A second ion source for ambient mass spectrometry is also presented, the switched ferroelectric plasma ionizer (SwiFerr). The source comprises a 1 mm thick plate of barium titanate with an electrode on one face and a grounded metallic grid on the opposite face. If an audio frequency high voltage waveform is applied to the electrode, domain structure is formed and the high electric fields across domain walls give rise to electron emission and plasma formation. At ambient pressure, the plasma produces chemical ionization reagent ions which participate in proton transfer reactions with trace species in ambient air. The source is useful for examining organic vapors and solid samples. Solid sampling is achieved through use of a pneumatic aspirator, which can aspirate powders into the SwiFerr source for analysis. Powders of the drugs loperamide and ibuprofen were ionized and detected using SwiFerr. A second-generation SwiFerr source has been designed and implemented, and is described. The second-generation source is constructed in a unibody fashion, such that the rear electrode, grid, and electrical contact wires are attached as a single unit using conductive adhesives. This allows for a source which is further miniaturized and capable of insertion into a standard Swagelok fitting, for ease of integration into existing instrumentation. The source is particularly sensitive, and an application involving detection of trace explosives is presented. Nanogram quantity samples of TNT were ionized and detected with SwiFerr after volatilization using a rudimentary thermal <b>desorption</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Sensitive detection of TNT suggests use of SwiFerr in applications where sensitive detection in field portable instrumentation is desired. To this end, plans for a stand-alone power supply for this ionizer as well as a supply designed for operating the source in a constant discharge mode at low power are presented in an appendix. Additional work not related to ion source development is also presented in this thesis. Chapter 6 presents advances in free radical initiated peptide sequencing (FRIPS). The 20 amino acid basis set has been analyzed for reactivity with acetyl radical, and distinct reactivity classes are observed. Chapter 7 presents a study of regioselective cleavage at aspartic acid residues by various cations. Selective cleavage at aspartic acid is observed for any cation which is not mobile along the peptide backbone, and fragmentation proceeds through a salt bridge mechanism...|$|E
