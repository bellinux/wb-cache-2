40|$|A reversed-phase liquid {{chromatography}} method for determination of maduramicin in feedingstuffs and premixtures was developed, validated, and interlaboratory studied. The extraction solvent was methanol. Maduramicin was detected at 520 nm after postcolumn derivatization with vanillin. Recovery was > 90 ÐThe repeatability {{relative standard deviation}} (RSDr) in feeds (1 - 5 mg/kg) and premixtures (500 mg/kg) ranged between 2. 7 and 7. 7 the within-laboratory reproducibility was between 3. 7 and 8. 5 %. The limit of quantitation was 2 mg/kg. Other feed additives did not interfere in the assay. The method showed ruggedness against small changes in the extraction conditions, eluant composition, and conditions for postcolumn derivatization. The presence {{of water in the}} extraction solvent negatively affected the recovery. In the collaborative study, 5 feeds (4 positive at 2. 5 - 9 mg/kg, 1 blank) and 1 premixture (450 mg/kg) were analyzed by 10 laboratories. The RSDr of the feedingstuffs varied between 3. 29 and 8. 53 ÐThe HORRAT ranged between 1. 10 and 1. 98. Recoveries were > 90 °except for one participant (80 % One laboratory detected small signals in the blank sample, corresponding to 0. 7 and 0. 8 mg/kg. <b>For</b> the <b>premixture,</b> the RSDr was 3. 15 nd the HORRAT was 1. 80...|$|R
40|$|The Cool Flame Experiment aims {{to address}} the role of {{diffusive}} transport on the structure and the stability of gas-phase, non-isothermal, hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, cool flames and auto-ignition fronts in an unstirred, static reactor. These reactions cannot be studied on Earth where natural convection due to self-heating {{during the course of}} slow reaction dominates diffusive transport and produces spatio-temporal variations in the thermal and thus species concentration profiles. On Earth, reactions with associated Rayleigh numbers (Ra) less than the critical Ra for onset of convection (Ra(sub cr) approx. 600) cannot be achieved in laboratory-scale vessels for conditions representative of nearly all low-temperature reactions. In fact, the Ra at 1 g ranges from 10 (exp 4) - 10 (exp 5) (or larger), while at reduced-gravity, these values can be reduced two to six orders of magnitude (below Ra(sub cr)), depending on the reduced-gravity test facility. Currently, laboratory (1 g) and NASA s KC- 135 reduced-gravity (g) aircraft studies are being conducted in parallel with the development of a detailed chemical kinetic model that includes thermal and species diffusion. Select experiments have also been conducted at partial gravity (Martian, 0. 3 gearth) aboard the KC- 135 aircraft.

40|$|A new, {{simple and}} {{fit for purpose}} method based on liquid {{chromatography}} with UV spectrophotometric detection and post-column derivatisation (LC-UV-PCD) for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed, premixtures and feed additive {{as well as its}} discrimination from other coccidiostats in poultry compound feed has been developed and single-laboratory validated. The concentration levels of the target analyte at which the validation experiments have been carried out varied between 12. 8 and 51. 3 mg kg− 1 in compound feed, covering the authorised levels of semduramicin according to European Union legislation. Furthermore, the method has been validated <b>for</b> a <b>premixture</b> sample containing semduramicin at 3 g kg− 1 and the feed additive containing semduramicin at 51 g kg− 1. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats with acetonitrile from the feed samples followed by a filtration of the supernatants. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. When analysing the feed additive and the premixture samples, the extraction solution was appropriately diluted prior to LC-UV-PCD analysis. The analytes were quantified through an external calibration curve prepared with pure semduramicin standards. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and for intermediate precision varied from 2. 4 to 8. 8 % and from 2. 6 to 8. 8 %, respectively, and the values for the relative recovery rate ranged from 89 to 95 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be below 1 mg kg− 1 and 3 mg kg− 1, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a comparable performance profile, when using methyl isobutyl ketone instead of acetonitrile as extraction solvent. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed at authorised level, in premixtures and in the feed additive, hence allowing the enforcement of the European Union legislation regarding the control and the monitoring in feedingstuffs.
