40|$|This study {{explored}} undergraduate music majors' {{strategies in}} two-part dictation. Sixty volunteers answered a questionnaire on their musical background, learning styles, and dictation methods. They then {{took part in}} three dictation sessions. Two sessions directed attention to rhythm first or pitch first, and one session was a non-directed <b>control</b> <b>dictation.</b> Treatments were counterbalanced across 6 groups (n = 10). Dependent measures were pitch and rhythm accuracy scores on dictations. Analysis of variance showed no order effects. A repeated measures MANOVA (pitch and rhythm by 3 conditions) showed a significant effect for condition ($p <. 0001 $). Higher rhythm accuracy resulted from the rhythm-first condition, compared to the non-directed ($p <. 05 $) and pitch-first ($p <. 0001 $) conditions. Pitch accuracy was not affected by condition. Accuracy was unrelated {{to any of the}} covariates examined (instrumental information, years of theory and counterpoint study, keyboard skill, learning style and private strategy). Results suggest that in polyphonic dictation, attending to rhythm first and pitch afterwards may be an effective way of maximizing rhythmic accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Listening skill {{plays an}} {{important}} role in communication. Listening is the first language skill to be learned by language students but teaching listening is not easy. There are many problems to teach listening in senior high school. In fact, some students have difficulties in listening. Teachers must find listening activities that keep the students interested and attentive and that provide appropriate challenge. The teachers should give the lesson as interesting as they can. It makes the students enjoy learning listening more. The teachers have to be creative to use technique to teach listening. In this study, the writer wanted to compare the effectiveness of Jigsaw Dictation Technique and Listening Cloze Technique on the tenth graders' listening comprehension achievement. The data were taken at SMA YPPI 1 Surabaya. This study is a quasi-experimental study emphasizing the treatment of the two groups and pre-test and post-test design. The writer employed two groups: the experimental and the control group. To measure the difference in students’ listening ability between the two groups, a post-test was administered to the both groups. Each of the two groups was given treatment for five times. The experimental group was the group that was taught using jigsaw <b>dictation.</b> The <b>control</b> group was the group that was taught with listening cloze. Both groups were given a set of tests which consisted of 20 items of gap completion. The scores were obtained with t-test calculation. The result was that jigsaw dictation technique affects the students’ listening comprehension achievement better than listening cloze technique on tenth graders. Basing on the findings, the writer concludes that the teaching listening using jigsaw dictation technique is more effective than the teaching listening using listening cloze technique. Using jigsaw dictation technique, the students will be more active in class because they do not only learn listening but they also learn speaking, reading and writing better...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a project designed {{to develop and}} implement a computer based system to be utilized in the design and analysis of vocabulary-controlled dictation material. The system is, based {{on the use of the}} 1, 500 most frequently used words in business communications (as established by Mellinger), and words are coordinated with the theory lessons in beginning Gregg shorthand textbooks. As such, the dictation material generated under these conditions provides a fundamentally structured approach to speed building.

40|$|Almost {{seventy percent}} of final product forms are {{determined}} at conceptual shape modeling and exploration stages which involve generation of a rich set of geometric proxies {{with the assistance of}} various computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering (CAE) tools [1]. This practice facilitates existing computational tools in congruent with visual and physical references such as rough sketches, 2 D line drawings, prototypes or 3 D wireframe drawings. Although these initial proxies can be ample to capture the intended forms with sufficient accuracy, design practice is impeded by current CAD tools as they require careful and laborious <b>dictation</b> and <b>control</b> of the geometric data for digital content generation and recovery. The root cause is lack of computational support for utilization of design content from primitive proxies that moves designers’ focus from aesthetic shape ideation to laborious digital model construction or modification. In this research, we propose new computational tools to remedy technical challenges that prevent utilization of geometric content from primitive proxies in construction or recovery of approximate geometrical models for rapid exploration and reverse engineering purposes. The overarching objective of this Ph. D. research is identification and utilization of geometric design content that is common among alternative form candidates in a conceptual design activity. If this can be achieved, novel computational tools that will enable rapid generation and modifications of digital forms by alleviating redundant and laborious work flows required by existing CAD tools can be developed. To achieve this objective we identified three main technical goals: (1) rapid conversion of design information contained in primitive shape proxies without any topological or geometric constraints into a digital data that is suitable for further beatification and refinement using conventional CAD tools, (2) an automatic computational tool for deformation transfer from physical prototypes to expedite digital shape exploration and design recovery from physical prototypes (3) sketch-based computational techniques that allow rapid topology insertions and modifications to provide effortless transitions between physical and digital media for final product form quest...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{discharge}} summary {{is an important}} method of communicating information necessary for continuing patient care. Deficiencies in {{discharge summary}} content, accuracy, and timeliness are a common problem. To improve summaries, studies have assessed physician-in-training (housestaff) education, alteration of the summary format; and collating information within computer databases into a summary. The most promising technology for improving discharge summaries is the clinical database. Primary objective. To compare medical discharge summaries generated from a clinical database with those created by narrative letter <b>dictation.</b> Design. Randomized <b>controlled</b> trial assigning patients to database (DB) or dictated (dictated-random or D-R) summaries. This was preceded by a prospective cohort study where summaries for all patients were created by dictation (dictated-cohort or D-C group). Inclusion criteria and study setting. All patients admitted to and discharged alive from the general internal medicine service in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Intervention. For patients randomized to the DB group, housestaff completed forms capturing hospital and discharge information important for the discharge summary. This information was entered into a database along with portions of the admission history and physical-examination form. Information in the database was collated into a report to create a database discharge summary. For patients in the D-R and the D-C group, housestaff used narrative dictation to create summaries.

40|$|The JURISDICT speech {{database}} {{is a large}} {{continuous speech}} database originally designed for dictated speech recognition. The database includes above 1500 annotated sessions of speakers from 16 regions of Poland, plus another 500 experimental recordings. The JURISDICT database is intended to provide material for both training and testing of speech dictation of common and legal texts, including isolated word systems, word-spotting systems and vocabulary independent systems which use either whole word or sub-word modeling approaches. The typical JURISDICT recording session scenario {{is a mixture of}} semi-spontaneous (<b>controlled</b> <b>dictation)</b> and read/dictated speech. The specification is based on the general language features and also on peculiarities of Polish on the different linguistic as well as phonetic levels. The general assumptions for the structure of database take into account text features: semantic structure, syntactic factors, grammatical and acoustic-phonetic factors and speaking style: semi-spontaneous, <b>controlled</b> spontaneous <b>dictation,</b> elicited dictation (answering speech). The development of the database, as well as the first analyses of its contents were possible thanks to the work of several dozens of contributors (researchers, engineers, annotators, and technicians), including the authors of the following publications: The design, structure, and annotation of the resource were described e. g. in: Demenko, G., Grocholewski, S., Klessa, K., Ogórkiewicz, J., Wagner, A., Lange, M., [...] . & Cylwik, N.
