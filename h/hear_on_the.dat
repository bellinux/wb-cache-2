5|$|In 2003, GMG radio {{conducted}} {{market research}} into the type of music that listeners in the north-west of England wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played {{middle of the road}} music, soul and R during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{the year}} after he retired, Botham became embroiled in a legal dispute with Imran Khan who, in an article for India Today, had accused Botham and Allan Lamb of {{bringing}} cricket into disrepute. Botham and Lamb instigated a libel action in response. The case was heard at the High Court in 1996 with the court choosing to <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day a separate action brought solely by Botham against Imran who had suggested in a newspaper article that Botham {{had been involved in}} ball-tampering. This would become the subject of a court case later on, one that Imran would go on to win. Botham was liable for all expenses in the court case in the ruling, including those incurred by Imran.|$|E
25|$|Martin Scorsese {{decided to}} {{assemble}} a soundtrack made of music that was popular at the time using his personal collection of 78s. With the help of Robbie Robertson, the songs were carefully chosen so {{they would be the}} ones that a person would <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio, at the pool or in bars and clubs which reflected the mood of that particular era. Some lyrics from songs would also be slipped into some dialogue. The Intermezzo from Cavalleria rusticana by Italian composer Pietro Mascagni would serve as the main theme to Raging Bull after a successful try-out by Scorsese and the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, over the film's opening titles. Two other Mascagni pieces were used in the film: the Barcarolle from Silvano, and the Intermezzo from Guglielmo Ratcliff. A two-CD soundtrack was released in 2005, long after the film was released, because of earlier difficulties obtaining rights for many of the songs, which Scorsese selected from his childhood memories growing up in New York.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested that a federal judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like a VCR, DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Melody Maker found 1987 [...] "inspirational", and [...] "the most exciting, most original record [...] {{heard in}} years". He also argued that: [...] "Some snatches [...] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz {{away from the}} clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they make anything else you're very likely to <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio dull and desperately humourless." [...] "It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics {{as little more than}} a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town", a later article said, but [...] "believe me, it's far more than a gimmick".|$|E

[...] The game was influenced greatly by American forces in Europe during and after World War I and many European Countries as a result began to play Basketball. [...] Britain continued to be influenced during this period, and YMCA clubs developed the game with added flavour. [...] Rules, however, continued to vary according to the country in which the game was played and this state was to continue for a great number of years.|$|E

Jim Farber of the Daily News called the opening [...] "classic enough" [...] for Michael Jackson. After the [...] "sweeping" [...] orchestral intro, the song transcends into a [...] "funky main section", which, according to Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, is a [...] "sweet slice of funk-soul seduction". According to Thomas, [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] starts off like a [...] "classic Sinatra song": with a [...] "rise of strings" [...] that [...] "hit a pitch before dropping into a neo-soul sound".|$|E

500|$|Hogarth {{aimed to}} [...] "bring Ed's guitar sound {{into the modern}} era, but {{maintaining}} all the DNA of the past." [...] He suggested that the guitar sound be split naturally between stereo channels, instead of separating lead guitar to the left channel and panning effects to the right by using two guitar amplifiers placed far apart. The idea {{was to have a}} guitar sound [...] "that was wide and mono, and not digital delay-driven, and it's what you <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record, with only a few overdubs". A more complex structure would be utilized for Wolfgang's bass, as the band wanted [...] "a bass sound that covered the whole spectrum, from high to low and clean to dirty", and his instrument was recorded by up to eight separate microphones. A multi-mic set-up was also employed for Alex's drums, with most of the final drumming coming from overhead microphones. Roth's vocals were all recorded at Henson, without compression.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} episode, viewers complained on social {{networking}} websites after {{it appeared that}} pitch correction (which {{has been seen as}} controversial in the music industry) was used {{to improve the quality of}} some singers' voices, and forty-five viewers complained to Ofcom. Series producers claimed post-production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming: [...] "The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. When it gets to the live shows, it will be all live." [...] It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re-edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been [...] "materially misled" [...] as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants.|$|E
500|$|According to guitarist Huw Bunford {{the track}} had the working title [...] "Miami Vice" [...] as it {{featured}} a drum roll {{similar to one}} used in the theme tune to the 80's television show of the same name.

Some promotional copies of Phantom Power featured [...] "Slow Life" [...] as the first track although it eventually appeared as the last track on the officially released version of the album. Gruff Rhys has stated that the song had to go at either the beginning or the end of the record as it is the [...] "most sonically impressive" [...] track on the album. Rhys has described his lyrics as [...] "regurgitating what we <b>hear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> news, recycled, vomiting them all back". The Guardian has interpreted the song as a [...] "cutting critique of middle-east colonialism".|$|E

Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
