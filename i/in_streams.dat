5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents <b>in</b> <b>streams</b> are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E

His thesis, written in German, was on Geschieb Bewegung, the bedload movement <b>in</b> <b>streams.</b> Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to Eastport, Maine as chief of the Engineering Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. There, he established a concrete testing laboratory under Charles E. Wuerpel which {{is now part of}} the Structures Laboratory at the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Due to political forces, the project came to nothing and was allowed to die. After the Passamaquoddy project fell through, Casey served with the Boston Engineer District on flood control surveys of the Connecticut River Valley.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} <b>in</b> <b>streams</b> under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they}} are among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt <b>in</b> <b>streams</b> for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E

40|$|Dendritic stream {{networks}} are inherently spatially and hierarchically structured, but {{the effects of}} this structure on stream communities are largely unknown. My aim was to investigate spatial patterns <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> networks using extensive spatial sampling of both adult and benthic macroinvertebrates <b>in</b> four <b>stream</b> networks on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Using spatial modelling and analyses, I answered questions about appropriate spatial measurements to capture ecological processes <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> networks, metacommunity processes at different scales in space and time, and how local and regional processes interact to structure metacommunities <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> networks. Spatial eigenfunction analyses showed that distance measures that explained most variance <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> macroinvertebrate communities were stream distance and weighted stream distance measures. They performed better than Euclidean distance to measure spatial structure that is ecologically relevant to stream network communities. The spatial pattern of benthic stream macroinvertebrates was stable over time, whereas community composition changed significantly, as shown by space-time interactions modelled by MANOVA-like redundancy analysis. Thus, spatial processes structuring stream metacommunities remained constant, in agreement with neutral model predictions. Network-scale properties, particularly flood disturbances, influenced the relative importance of spatial and environmental variation <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> network metacommunities. Additionally, quantile regression indicated that three key variables, habitat size, isolation and local habitat conditions, jointly limited community structure <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> networks, providing empirical support for both island biogeography and metacommunity theories. My study indicated that spatial structuring has an important influence on stream macroinvertebrate communities. The results contribute to broader ecological theory and understanding of community assembly by relating empirical results to theoretical predictions. In particular, they advance understanding of spatial processes <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> networks. The research also highlights a number of new methods, which were successfully applied to stream systems to elucidate complex spatial patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In two montane {{watersheds}} {{that receive}} minimal deposition of atmospheric nitrogen, 15 – 71 % of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was bioavailable <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> water over a 2 -year period. Discharge-weighted concentrations of bulk DON were between 102 and 135 lg/l, and the C:N ratio differed substantially between humic and non-humic fractions of DON. Approximately 70 % of DON export occurred during snowmelt, and 40 % of that DON was biologically available to microbes <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> sediments. Concentrations of bioavailable DON <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> water were 2 – 16 {{times greater than}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) during the growing season, and bioavailable DON was depleted within 2 – 14 days during experimental incubations. Uptake of DON {{was influenced by the}} concentration of inorganic N <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> water, the concentration of non-humic DON <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> water, and the C:N ratio of the non-humic fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Uptake of DON declined logarithmically as the concentration of inorganic N <b>in</b> <b>stream</b> water increased. Experimental additions of inorganic N also caused a decline in uptake of DON and net production of DON when the C:N ratio of non-humic DOM was high. This study indicates that the relative and absolute amount of bioavailable DON can vary greatly within and across years due to interactions between the availability of inorganic nutrients and composition of DOM. DOM {{has the potential to be}} used biotically at a high rate <b>in</b> nitrogen-poor <b>streams,</b> and it may be generated by heterotrophic microbes when DIN and labile DOM with low relative nitrogen content become abundant...|$|R

The Mlýnský stream catchment was characteristic by high representation of unforested habitats (pastures and mowed meadows), Horský stream by higher proportion of forested habitats and non equal management (plots without management). The biomass characteristics (above ground and dry) were measured on studied plots. The method of pitfall trapping was used for beetle sampling. Beetle species {{were divided into two}} groups after its preferences to shaded: species occurring in unshaded habitats and species occurring in shaded habitats. The degree of human impact was studied by finding of frequency of species of different ecological groups. The above ground biomass was about 2 time higher <b>in</b> Mlýnský <b>stream</b> than <b>in</b> the Horský <b>stream.</b> The dry biomass was practically the same. 57 species was found <b>in</b> the Mlýnský <b>stream</b> and 33 <b>in</b> the Horský <b>stream.</b> The activity of beetles was about five times higher <b>in</b> Mlýnský <b>stream</b> than <b>in</b> the Horský <b>stream.</b> Ubiquitous species prevail <b>in</b> Mlýnský <b>stream</b> and adaptive species <b>in</b> the Horský <b>stream.</b> Stenotopic species were found <b>in</b> the Mlýnský <b>stream</b> only.
