50|$|Gulf darters {{may live}} up to 35 months. The gulf darter mates during mid-February to late March, {{typically}} when water temperatures are between 5.5 and 17.0 °C; they congregate on gravel shoals where the stream leaves a pool to mate. Once mates are selected, the <b>fish</b> <b>mate</b> repeatedly for several days until the female lays about 90 eggs.

40|$|Captive {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio) {{exhibit a}} limited repertoire of mating behaviors, {{likely due to}} the somewhat unnatural environment of aquaria.

Although we did not see an increase in the likelihood of a pair of <b>fish</b> to <b>mate,</b> we did see an increase in the embryo output in both adults and juveniles. In the adults, tilting led to a significant increase in embryo production (436 [*]±[*] 35 tilted vs. 362 [*]±[*] 34 untilted; p[*]<[*] 0. 05). A similar effect was seen in juvenile fish as they progressed through sexual maturity.

5000|$|Darters have a {{wide range}} of life histories, but size {{correlates}} with most life history characteristics. For example, larger darters grow faster, live longer, produce bigger clutches, and have longer reproductive spans. Mate selection by female darters is assumed to be common. When examining the rainbow darter, life history traits were: average size 45 mm, growth 32 mm, maximum age four years, and clutch size 82. [...] E. caeruleum mates during the spring, typically when water temperature is between 17 and 18 °C, and they will leave their normal microhabitat in the rapids to congregate on pebbles, where the stream leaves a pool, to mate.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour of the stoplight parrotfish, Sparisoma viride Bonnaterre, was studied on two Caribbean {{islands of the}} Netherlands Antilles. In the northwest of Bonaire, the S. viride population living on the reef off Karpata exists of group fishes sharing a common home range in the shallowest parts of the reef and haremic fishes occupying {{most of the rest}} of the reef. Group fishes were not seen spawning in their feeding area, but some may spawn during about one hour daily close after sunrise on the reef slope at a depth of ca. 40 m. Haremic <b>fishes</b> <b>mate</b> consistently in the early morning in their territories. Harem males may spawn up to 12 times daily and can have extraharemic matings. Harem females spawn once or twice with the harem male, but additionally may mate at a deep spawning site. In the late afternoon the haremic fishes may spawn again for a shorter period and at a lower frequency. In the southwest of Bonaire, the S. viride population living on Tori's reef consists of only haremic individuals. The <b>fishes</b> <b>mate</b> exclusively in their territories during about one hour daily in the mid afternoon. Females spawn once or twice a day, while the harem males may spawn up to 6 times daily. Differences in the daily timing of spawning between these reefs are probably related to the different times of the day at which local currents are favourable for larval retention. In the northwest of Saba, the S. viride population living in Well's bay exists of nonharemic wandering fishes who spawn at a very low level in July. Seasonal spawning during the cooler months of the year is suggested. Differences in the timing of spawning might indicate tidal tracking. The variety in socio-sexual system at the three study sites suggests an adaptation to local variation in resources. Significant differences in the spawning behaviour of the fishes at the different localities are probably the result of the plastic nature of this behaviour varying under different environmental conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Rosylip sculpin Ascelichthys rhodorus spawned in the {{intertidal}} {{during the}} winter in the northeastern Pacific. Large numbers of males typically congregated at spawning sites, where females deposited clutches. The mating system of this species was external fertilization and group spawning at specific oviposition sites under boulders in the intertidal, and no alternative male mating strategies. Males were abundant at sites while oviposition was occurring, and most abandoned the sites as spawning tapered off seasonally {{despite the presence of}} developing clutches. Experimental removal of males from sites suggested that males provided some shortterm benefits to clutches, with catastrophic loss of clutches significantly lower when males were present.

50|$|The Brazilian {{guitarfish}} is a low-fecundity viviparous <b>fish.</b> <b>Mating</b> {{takes place}} on the inner continental shelf in March and soon afterwards the adults disperse to outer areas of the shelf. The eggs are contained within a casing and remain dormant inside the female until she return to the warm, shallow waters of the inner continental shelf in November.

The females mature at about 4 {{years of age and}} litter sizes range from 4 to 12, with larger fish having larger litters. The inner shelf provides important nursery areas for the young fish. Here both females and juveniles are particularly susceptible to being caught by pair-trawling and beach seine netting. Most of the catch is pregnant females. Later in the year, the adults disperse more widely over the inner shelf and are caught by otter-trawling.|$|R

5000|$|The leading theory {{regarding}} the evolutionary selection of UV vision in select fish species {{is due to}} its strong role in mate selection. Behavioral experiments show that African cichlids utilize visual cues when choosing a mate. Their breeding sites are typically in shallow waters with high clarity and UV light penetration. Male African cichlids are largely a blue color that is reflective in UV light. Females are able to correctly choose a mate of their species when these reflective visual cues are present. This suggests that UV light detection is crucial for correct mate selection. [...] UV reflective color patterns also enhance male attractiveness in guppies and three-spined sticklebacks. In experimental settings, female guppies spent significantly more time inspecting males with UV-reflective coloring than those with UV reflection blocked. [...] Similarly, female three-spined sticklebacks preferred males viewed in full spectrum over those viewed in UV blocking filters. These results strongly suggest the role of UV detection in sexual selection and, thus, reproductive fitness. The prominent role of UV light detection in <b>fish</b> <b>mate</b> choice has allowed the trait to be maintained over time.UV vision may also be related to foraging and other communication behaviors.|$|R

25|$|Electric fishes {{communicate}} with electric signals that possess two main qualities - frequency and waveform.

EOD waveform, in some species, changes with developmental stages. Frequency of EODs and interval duration between them are called sequence of pulse intervals (SPI), which are controlled by the command interneurons in the midbrain and medulla, as stated under electric organs.

40|$|In poeciliid fishes, males {{can gain}} {{copulation}} either by courting females or through sexual coercion. In some species these two tactics coexist. However, {{in about half}} of the poeciliids, males do not display, females never cooperate during copulation and all matings are achieved by thrusting the intromittent organ toward the genital pore of apparently unaware females. In one of these species, the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), the probability of insemination is influenced by the time females are previously deprived of males, suggesting that females exert some control over the occurrence of mating even in a system apparently dominated by sexual coercion. In the present study we investigated the tendency of female mosquitofish to approach males in relation to their reproductive status and the time they were previously deprived of males. The tendency to approach males increased in females that were previously deprived of males and in females that had recently given birth. When allowed to choose between males, male-deprived females preferred larger males and normally pigmented over melanistic males. Females preferred groups of three males over a single male, whereas the preference for three males over a group of one male and two females was only marginally significant. Collectively, these results suggest that, even when coercive mating is the only tactic adopted by males, females may be able to influence the outcome of these attempts, and thus exert some control over the paternity of their offspring.
