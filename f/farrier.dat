5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a <b>farrier,</b> {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E

The {{distinctive}} uniform and equipment of the <b>farriers</b> of the Life Guards—blue tunic, black plume and axe—is a historic {{reminder of the}} old British Army of the days of James Wolfe. Every cavalry regiment in the Army, other than the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues), originally wore scarlet for all ranks, except the <b>farriers.</b> <b>Farriers</b> were garbed invariably in sombre blue and bore axes, worn at the side, like the swords of their comrades. When on parade, the troopers drew swords, the <b>Farriers</b> drew axes and carried them at the [...] "Advance".|$|R

5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent <b>farrier.</b> He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the <b>farrier</b> {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the <b>farrier</b> to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The <b>farrier</b> must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to organize and}} regulate the practice of treating animals {{tended to focus on}} horses because of their economic significance. In the Middle Ages from around 475 CE, <b>farriers</b> combined their work in horseshoeing with the more general task of [...] "horse doctoring". In 1356, the Lord Mayor of London, concerned at the poor standard of care given to horses in the city, requested that all <b>farriers</b> operating within a seven-mile radius of the City of London form a [...] "fellowship" [...] to regulate and improve their practices. This ultimately led to the establishment of the Worshipful Company of <b>Farriers</b> in 1674.|$|R
