For a small excursion fee, steamships carried countless New York families to this summer resort to enjoy its bathing pavilions, fine food and wines at the Grand Cafe, and the scenic beauty of Long Island Sound. The walkways along the harbor were lined with colorful flowers, classic bronze statues, and a natural spring that provided cool, fresh water. Winding pathways led visitors through landscaped grounds where they could escape the summer heat under groves of shade trees.

5000|$|Mouse Soup is a 1977 {{picture book}} by noted {{illustrator}} Arnold Lobel. Beginning {{with the simple}} sentence [...] "A mouse sat under a tree", the book goes on {{to tell the story}} of a mouse who has to trick Weasel from turning Mouse into Mouse Soup. He does that by telling stories about Bees and the Mud, Two Large <b>Stones,</b> The <b>Crickets,</b> and The Thorn Bush, and tells Weasel to put them into his soup.

40|$|Stone mulch offers {{potential}} benefits for water conservation in many rain-fed agricultural {{systems of the}} arid regions. The effects of stone mulch on transpiration and grain yield were examined for a durum wheat crop grown under soil water deficit stress. In a <b>greenhouse</b> trial, <b>stone</b> mulches with two levels of ground coverage significantly decreased soil-surface evaporation and increased crop transpiration. The transpiration increase contributed to increases both in biomass and grain yield. Field experiments over two cropping seasons confirmed yield increases of 12 % in soil half-covered and 24 % in soil fully-covered by stones. These significant yield increases indicate the potential usefulness of stone mulch technology in rain-fed cereal cropping. It is suggested that stones should not be removed from cereal fields unless their presence obstructs management severely. It remains to develop technologies for effectively managing soils containing large numbers of sizable stones {{in order to obtain}} the benefits of the potential yield increase associated with their presence on the soil surface...|$|R
50|$|Bolton v <b>Stone</b> 1951 A <b>cricket</b> {{ball was}} hit {{out of the}} ground, over a fence 17 feet high, {{striking}} and injuring a passer-by. It was held that {{despite the fact that}} the precautions in place were not sufficient to prevent such harm occurring, the defender had not been in breach of his duty of care. This was because in the past 30 years a ball had only left the grounds over that fence 6 times, making the likelihood of such an injury merely a remote possibility rather than a reasonable probability.|$|R
