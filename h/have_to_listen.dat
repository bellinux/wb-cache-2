5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E

We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to that (bleeping) CD again?'"

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track.

500|$|California is the band's first release through BMG Rights Management, {{and also}} among BMG's first {{releases}} through its distribution {{deal with the}} Alternative Distribution Alliance. The album was initially slated to be released independently, but they decided to work with BMG when that label acquired Vagrant Records. Vagrant had a promotional team that, according to Blink's manager Lawrence Varra, understood the culture surrounding the band and genre. The deal allowed the band and its management to be in near-complete control of the release and promotion of California. [...] "We didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to a major label spend the money they wanted to spend, [...] we'd just spend it ourselves the way we wanted to," [...] said Varra. Rather than [...] "window" [...] the album — an industry term for its release being exclusively physical {{for a period of}} time — the team chose to release California as wide as possible. [...] "We wanted the music to be accessible to the younger kids who listen to it on YouTube and Spotify and different places," [...] he said. In addition, they employed ticketing tiers for the California Tour, making it possible for hardcore fans to obtain the best seats, but also allowing it to be affordable for more casual fans. However, a hit was not guaranteed: [...] "I was speculative leading up, and nervous. This record could have gone either way," [...] said Jon Cohen, EVP of recorded music for BMG.|$|E

500|$|The {{title is}} a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several {{scenes from the}} Army {{training}} contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the song playing during the recruitment video bears a close resemblance to the Def Leppard song [...] "Pour Some Sugar On Me". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training {{is similar to that}} in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his [...] "kids" [...] with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song [...] "Bring Da Ruckus", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene {{about the importance of the}} food pyramid. The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says [...] "Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be [...] "Fraggle Ir-Rock", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. [...] When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie says that 10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle. After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read about the war in Iraq in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.|$|E
