5|$|After {{attending}} a theatre show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing {{from a dark}} alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. Morgan was struck in the right side. The bullet shattered <b>his</b> <b>spine,</b> passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped {{in the dark and}} Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E

50|$|Many {{people come}} to serve Glaaki willingly, in {{exchange}} for the promise of eternal life. What they don't realize is that he makes good on his promise by driving <b>his</b> <b>spines</b> into them, turning the worshiper into one of his undead slaves.|$|R
6000|$|That is {{all very}} well for foxes. One expects to find such an idea in wise little heads. But who taught Unk Wunk to roll {{downhill}} and stick <b>his</b> <b>spines</b> full of dry leaves to scare the wood folk? And when did he learn to use the tree-tops for his swing and the wind for his motive power? ...|$|R
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around <b>his</b> <b>spine.</b> According to Brown, these injuries {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
5|$|In January 1886 David {{spent a week}} in Auckland {{hospital}} undergoing {{surgery to}} treat stunted muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of <b>his</b> <b>spine.</b> His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took {{a job with a}} local stock and station agent.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting {{finishing touches on}} the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of <b>his</b> <b>spine.</b> Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of}} his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E

50|$|By driving one of <b>his</b> <b>spines</b> into a victim, and injecting {{a special}} fluid, Glaaki {{can turn the}} unfortunate into an undead slave. However, if the spine is broken off before the fluid is injected, the victim dies anyway, but is at least spared the fate of {{becoming}} one of Glaaki's slaves. The injected fluid produces growths throughout the victim's body that allow Gla'aki to manipulate the subject's corpse.|$|R
5000|$|Was laid up {{for three}} months with severe back {{problems}} beginning in with his injury at the Silverdollar Nationals in Reno, Nevada on January 8 or 9, 1994. He tore tendons and tissue in <b>his</b> lower <b>spine.</b> <b>His</b> first race back was the ABA U.S. Nationals in Clovis, California on March 11, 1994.|$|R
5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first film, Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after Mary Jane Watson, who is now engaged. Harry Osborn {{continues}} to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father Norman Osborn's death. Spider-Man contends with scientist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, who has four mechanical tentacles fused to <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> and sets out to recreate a fusion-based experiment that could destroy much of New York City.|$|E

5|$|When Boycott {{was eight}} years old, he was impaled through his chest by the handle of a mangle after falling off an iron railing near his home. Boycott nearly died, and in the efforts to save his life, his spleen was removed. In March 1950, Boycott's father had a serious {{accident}} {{while working as a}} coalminer, suffering severe damage to <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> after he was hit by empty coal carts; He never fully recovered, and died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from the lander, Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne mutagen to enter his ear canal. His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to the lander by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine in the room, where the first Neomorph bursts out of <b>his</b> <b>spine,</b> killing him.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he {{resigned}} from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had a hole in <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery {{he would have been}} unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin.|$|E
50|$|Injured {{in round}} 23, 2006, Rodney {{did not return}} to the NRL playing field until June, 2008. He {{underwent}} surgery on <b>his</b> ankle, <b>spine</b> and had two shoulder reconstructions.|$|R

50|$|On 21 January, {{the initial}} report {{indicated}} the first death occurred after a 22-year-old man fell from atop the 13-metre high colonnade {{in front of}} Dynamo Stadium while confronted by Berkut police, and suffered fractures to <b>his</b> <b>spine's</b> cervical vertebrae. Reports of the incident debate on whether the man jumped from the building to flee the beating, fell, or if he was pushed by police. Later reports caused confusion after it was reported by medical staff that an additional man, 43 years old, fell from the roof, but survived; however, he fell fixing an antenna and was not on Hrushevskoho.|$|R
5|$|Damage to Forte was extensive. The {{stern and}} side facing Sybille {{had been beaten}} in by gunfire as more than 300 shot holes {{combined}} to form gaping holes in hull above the waterline. As well as the masts the bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters. 65 of the crew had been killed, including Captain Beaulieu, and approximately 80 wounded, {{more than a third}} of the crew listed as casualties; many of the wounded later died from the effects of amputation. Damages to Sybille were considerably lighter: only six shot had struck the hull in the entire battle: one gun was dismounted, but the worst damage was to Cooke's cabin where a round shot had destroyed most of his furniture. In addition, most of the damage to the masts and rigging proved superficial. Just five crew were killed outright, with another 17 wounded, the latter including Cooke. The British captain had been struck in the left arm, the shot exiting near <b>his</b> <b>spine,</b> with additional injuries to the chest and right arm. He eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at Calcutta on 25 May 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours. A memorial was subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey in his memory.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through <b>his</b> <b>spine</b> at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking <b>his</b> <b>spine,</b> much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{and again}} his tongue shot out, and each shot was {{followed}} by a blink and a gulp. All the while that he kept up this rapid shooting he thought he was getting fresh caterpillars; and all the while the hairy fellow was shrinking closer and closer together and sticking <b>his</b> <b>spines</b> out like a porcupine. But he was getting more mucilage on him at every shot. [...] "That caterpillar is getting too stuck-up to live," [...] presently said little Johnnie, who was watching the game with me; and at the word a hairy ball shot into the wide mouth that was yawning for him, and K'dunk went back to his fly-catching.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pilot of}} Wallamet, James M. Fudge, had stepped on board Gazelle when Gazelle had come alongside, {{and had been}} blown into the river with <b>his</b> lower <b>spine</b> severed by a flying piece of debris. [...] He died within a few minutes.|$|R
50|$|His {{career was}} cut short after a violent crash during a {{training}} round at the Kulm ski flying hill on 13 January 2016. He suffered serious spinal injuries and an incomplete paralysis of the legs, and later underwent surgery for <b>his</b> lower <b>spine.</b>|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} 12 January that Dukovac added to his tally, a Yakovlev Yak-1. On 25 February, Dukovac flew five sorties. On the first he and his wingman downed a Yak-1 each, and on the second he shot down a Yak and a P-39. During his fifth mission, he was shot down by P-39s and crash-landed, {{injuring}} <b>his</b> <b>spine.</b> He was evacuated to a field hospital, but returned to 15./JG 52 {{as soon as he}} could walk, ten days later, only to find that he had just three pilots fit for duty. Despite the pending arrival of newly trained pilots, the loss of another two pilots by mid-March led the Luftwaffe to decide that attempting to maintain 15./JG 52 was futile, and the men were sent home to the NDH. During its three tours, the Staffel had accounted for a total of 297 Soviet aircraft, of which Dukovac had 37 confirmed and eight unconfirmed aerial victories, seven of which were later confirmed. At the beginning of July, the Luftwaffe reconsidered its decision, and the newly promoted Hauptmann Dukovac and a group of veteran and fresh pilots began to make their way back to the Eastern Front. They were transported to Romania and then the Slovak Republic, but no aircraft were provided, and on 21 July the pilots were advised that the HZL was to be disbanded. Despite this, in August they were moved to an airfield in East Prussia, where they took delivery of ten Bf 109G-14s. At the beginning of September they flew to Lithuania in preparation to rejoin the fray.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing <b>his</b> <b>spine.</b> Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of <b>his</b> <b>spine,</b> and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 {{during a}} race in Germany he hurt {{his back and}} {{returned}} home to the UK. After having his back scanned, surgeons found he had ruptured an artery on <b>his</b> lower <b>spine</b> and this brought an abrupt end to the season ahead.|$|R
