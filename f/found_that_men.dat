5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> were often {{directed}} {{to go on}} pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, a study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> with {{a history}} of victimization, {{especially}} having been raped or otherwise sexually coerced themselves, were more likely than otherwise to have participated in both single perpetrator and multiple perpetrator non-partner rape. 57Â·5% (587/1022) of men who raped a non-partner committed their first rape as teenagers.|$|E
25|$|Support for {{the idea}} that rape {{provides}} males {{with a way to}} increase their reproductive success comes from a study by Barbaro and Shackelford, who <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> in committed heterosexual relationships who had committed at least one act of violence/coercion towards their partner in the last month had more in-pair copulations per week.|$|E
25|$|Studies have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{are more}} likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women {{are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love {{are more likely to}} accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{analyses}} of the generation and spread of innovation led me {{to look into the}} generator and scatterer, man. Applying the same analytic techniques as are used for examining societal structures, I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>man</b> is highly ordered and regulated. His output therefore can be simply described and, to an extent, predicted. This generalizes the principle that the biological paradigm can be extended to social behavior...|$|R
50|$|In another scenario, a crime-scene DNA {{sample is}} {{compared}} against {{a database of}} 20,000 men.

This {{does not mean the}} probability that the suspect is innocent is 1 in 10,000. Since 20,000 men were tested, there were 20,000 opportunities to find a match by chance.|$|R

25|$|Namie's {{study of}} {{workplace}} bullying found that 31% {{of women and}} 21% of men who reported workplace bullying exhibited three key symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (hypervigilance, intrusive imagery, and avoidance behaviours). A 1998 study of male college students (n = 70) by Simonelli & Ingram <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> who were emotionally abused by their female partners exhibited higher rates of chronic depression than the general population.|$|E
25|$|As {{time has}} passed, the sample has dwindled. As of 2003, {{there were over}} 200 members of the sample still alive. The study is to {{continue}} until the final member of the sample either withdraws or dies. In the 21st century researchers continue to publish articles based on the data collected in the Genetic Studies of Genius. For example, one article <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> who skipped a grade in childhood had higher incomes throughout adulthood, a finding that has been replicated in more modern samples.|$|E
25|$|A {{relationship}} between the early experiences and environment of boys, and their later sexual behaviour, has been drawn by several studies. Research suggests that father absence can {{lead to an increase}} in rape behaviour. Research conducted by Malamuth <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> raised in the absence of their father (or where resources were scarce) reported more use of sexual coercion in the past, and were more likely to indicate being more willing to rape, in the event that there was no chance of them getting caught. Research has also found that parental divorce and rape correlate positively.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} posit additionally {{that men}} are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.|$|E
25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role}} of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E

50|$|A 2012 study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> both <b>men</b> {{and women}} are willing to excuse height {{differences}} by using a trade-off approach. Men may compensate 1.3 BMI units with a 1 percent higher wage than their wife. Women may compensate 2 BMI units with an additional year of higher education. Furthermore, a 2015 study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> both <b>men</b> and women receive benefits for having a tall spouse. The husband's gains include beauty that results from his wife's positive attributes that are correlated with her height such as education. The wife {{on the other hand}} looks for a tall husband due to them generating higher earnings.|$|R
50|$|Sonja B. Starr {{conducted}} a study <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> serve, on average, 63% longer prison sentences than women when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Sonja B. Starr denies <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are disadvantaged generally in criminal justice. Warren Farrell identifies 12 criminal defenses that are only available to women. Men's rights advocates have argued <b>that</b> <b>men</b> being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder is evidence <b>that</b> <b>men</b> are being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes. The National Coalition for Men states that killing a female rather than a male causes a larger sentence length, {{even more than the}} increase observed by killing a white person rather than a black person.|$|R
25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study participants were given pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} shown that a high resting heart rate is {{associated}} with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level of physical fitness. Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate {{has been shown to be}} associated with a 10â20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{researchers}} Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad {{conducted a}} large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests {{taken from the}} Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} difference on the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary Mental Abilities reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that g factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not g factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>men</b> and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E
