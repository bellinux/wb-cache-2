The study also {{sheds light on}} the utility of daily instruments for evaluations involving executives in other fields. The <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> was evaluated against two criteria: 1) Is it feasible to induce strong cooperation and high response rates among school principals with a daily instrument?, and 2) Can a <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> provide accurate estimates {{of the practice of}} school principals? We found that a data collection strategy with substantial subject contact time and strategic follow ups maintained substantial principal cooperation and yielded high response rates. The accuracy of the log was confirmed through comparisons with an experience sampling instrument and direct observations. <b>Daily</b> <b>logs</b> appear to be a viable means of measuring the work of executives in a way that overcomes limitations of one time surveys...|$|R

In addition, the present study fi nds an evidence of leverage effect, which implies that traders assign more weightage to bad news, whereas, they cautiously react to positive news. Mean reversion in <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> returns of the Indian equity futures market further suggests that traders (especially retail traders) need to be overcautious while adding equity futures as leverage products in their portfolio because in a highly volatile market, framing a trading rule to earn super normal profi t may be an easy task for big/institutional traders but may not be possible for small/uninformed traders...|$|R

Ten families of 0 -to- 4 -year-old children with severe disabilities participated in semi-structured interviews and completed questionnaires concerning their child 2 ̆ 7 s and the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern. Relationships between daily life patterns were classified into three types: 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern has {{to adapt to the}} child 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 The child 2 ̆ 7 s and family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life patterns correspond 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern is established by family coping strategies 2 ̆ 2. Factors found to determine these types were the child 2 ̆ 7 s sleep pattern, age, developmental stage, bad mood, and the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> coordination of <b>daily</b> life with coping strategies. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern has to adapt to the child 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 -type families include: child is 0 -to- 1 -year-old, is in post-natal developmental stage, displays an irregular sleep pattern and bad mood. Family members reported feeling uncertainty, an elevated sense of caregiver burden, and a need for further knowledge of the disease, however, limited resources are available. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 The child 2 ̆ 7 s and family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life patterns correspond 2 ̆ 2 -type families are: child is approximately 1 year old, has reached the developmental milestones for children at the 3 - 4 -month-old developmental stage. Family members expressed concern regarding motor development only. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern is established by family coping strategies 2 ̆ 2 -type families include: the child is 2 to 4 years old and is still in the post-natal developmental stage.

These results indicate that nursing practice for improving family coping is needed. 在宅の重度の障害をもつ乳幼児と家族の健康的な生活に向けた援助を考える目的で,児の生活パターンと家族の生活パターンの関連と影響している要因について, 10 ケースの家族を対象に半構成的面接および質問紙による調査を行った。児と家族の生活パターンの関連は,「家族が児に合わせざるをえない」型,「児と家族が一致」型,「家族なりの対処で家族なりの生活」型に分類された。型を決定づける要因は,児の睡眠パターン,発達段階,生活年齢,児の不機嫌,睡眠-活動パターンの調整であった。「家族が児に合わせざるをえない」型は,児の年齢が 1 歳代,発達段階が新生児期,睡眠パターンが不規則,児の不機嫌さがあった。家族は将来への不安や,孤独感を述べ,育児負担感があった。情報ニーズは高いが,適切な情報を得られていなかった。「児と家族が一致」型は,児の年齢は 1 歳代,人への関心があり,睡眠パターンは一定していた。運動発達の課題を意識して行い,健常児との比較で情報を得ていた。「家族なりの対処で家族なりの生活」型は,児の年齢は 2 〜 4 歳代,発達段階は新生児期,経過中の経験から家族なりの対処で生活が調整されていた。児にとっての良い生活を考える育児観に転換している家族もあった。以上より,児と家族の生活パターンと影響している要因を検討し,家族なりの対処を高める看護援助の方向性が示唆された...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{periodic}} {{extensions of}} dynamic long memory regression models with autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic errors are {{considered for the}} analysis of daily electricity spot prices. The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1, 200 to 4, 400 daily price observations. Apart from persistence, heteroskedasticity and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are modeled effectively by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables.

But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues.

However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R
