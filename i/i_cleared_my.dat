6000|$|The {{official}} {{interpreter of}} the court asked my name, and then spoke it aloud so that all could hear. Supposing that all was now ready, <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> throat and began--in Chinese, because of my imperfect English: ...|$|E
60|$|This done, {{instead of}} {{returning}} {{the box to}} my pocket I passed the chain through the buttonhole of my cloak and let it dangle on my breast as an ornament. When the cigarette was smoked, <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> throat in the orthodox manner and fixed my eyes on Runi, who, on his part, made a slight movement to indicate that {{he was ready to}} listen to what I had to say.|$|E

60|$|Heart-high, I say, my rapier entered Pasquini's {{side on the}} right, {{but it did not}} emerge, on the left, for, well-nigh through him, it met a rib (oh, man-killing is butcher's work!) {{with such}} a will that the forcing overbalanced him, so that he fell part {{backward}} and part sidewise to the ground. And even as he fell, and ere he struck, with jerk and wrench <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> weapon of him.|$|E
60|$|I looked up. At {{the first}} glance I did not {{recognise}} the speaker; but then as <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> mind I {{saw it was}} Ercole Piacentini. What was he doing here? Then I remembered that {{it was on the}} road to Forli. I supposed he had received orders to leave Castello and {{was on his way to}} his old haunts. However, I did not want to speak to him; I bent down, and again clasped my head in my hands.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> {{throat of}} a huskiness which {{prevented}} speech. “Hump,” he said slowly, “you can’t do it. You {{are not exactly}} afraid. You are impotent. Your conventional morality is stronger than you. You are the slave to the opinions which have credence among the people you have known and have read about. Their code has been drummed into your head {{from the time you}} lisped, and in spite of your philosophy, and of what I have taught you, it won’t let you kill an unarmed, unresisting man.” ...|$|E

Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again. He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it. Seemed an age. 'Well?' said <b>I,</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>my</b> throat, 'there's nothing in it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Being thus invited, I {{consented to}} spin them a yarn. The old gentleman settled {{himself in his}} chair, my mother {{smoothed}} her apron, folded her hands, and looked meekly into my face. Tom Lokins filled his pipe, stretched out his foot to poke the fire {{with the toe of}} his shoe, and began to smoke like a steam-engine; then <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> throat and began my tale, and before I had done talking that night, I had told them all that I have told in this little book, almost word for word.|$|E

I was as mad as a March hare, and after that I got only madder. I reformed. Think of that! Think of what a slip of a woman can do to a busy, roving man!--By the Lord Harry, it's true. I reformed. I went to church. Hear me! I became converted. <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> soul before God and kept my hands-- I had two then--off the ribald crew of the beach when it laughed at this, my latest antic, and wanted to know what was my game.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Schwalb {{explains}} how he {{became involved with}} this book: [...] "Ever since I became a freelance game designer, I've {{had a knack for}} landing jobs that dealt with evil subjects. Chris Perkins pinged me to work on Fiendish Codex I, but tragically I was swamped with a project for another company, and so I had to take a pass. I kicked myself. I wouldn't make that same mistake twice. So, <b>I</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> decks for this one. ... As for an interest in devils, I've always been keen on the darker elements in the D&D cosmology. Maybe it's because my mother freaked a bit (hi mom). Devils have been among the coolest for me since I got my hands on the 1st edition Monster Manual. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've had a fondness for Glasya since Monster Manual 2--what can I say, I like women with horns and tails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Work till I can {{pay back}} that poor fellow's fortune,' said the banker, earnestly {{pointing}} to Lancelot. 'And if <b>I</b> could <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> conscience of that, I would not care if I starved myself, hardly if {{my own children}} did.' ...|$|R

6000|$|As for the inn, yes, it {{was very}} bad. It had been quite good under the {{previous}} proprietors. But now--they shrugged their shoulders. The dirty-breast and the shawled girl were not the owners. They were merely conductors of the hotel: here a sarcastic curl of the lip. The owner {{was a man in}} the village--a young man. A week or two back, at Christmas time, there had been a roomful of men sitting drinking and roistering at this very table. When in had come the proprietor, mad-drunk, swinging a litre bottle round his head and yelling: [...] "Out! Out! Out, all of you! Out every one of you! I am proprietor here.
