500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think {{that the idea of}} a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
60|$|AUNT JUDY. Not a bit: {{we never}} have it airlier than this. I hope they <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dinner at Athenmullet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sorry}} if I've <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of trouble," [...] Millicent retorted. [...] "You were {{a long time}} in coming to my rescue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now don't {{you start}} to tease me," [...] {{returned}} Dick, his face redder than ever. [...] "I guess Dora always <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time, too." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{story was}} dramatised in more-or-less this {{form in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. However, even though the 1885–87 Japanese {{exhibition}} in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, [...] "I cannot <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think {{that the idea of}} a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis," [...] said Mr. Fairlie, [...] "show Mr. Gilmore out, {{and then}} come back and hold up my {{etchings}} for me again. Make them <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lunch downstairs. Do, Gilmore, make my idle beasts of servants <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lunch!" ...|$|E
60|$|I think I can <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{article on}} Hokusai; {{but that is}} for afterwards; Fontainebleau is first in hand.|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as he}} was gone, the {{boy with}} the red cap, said to Roger, [...] "I {{expected}} the master would have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scolding for talking so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Henry, <b>you</b> are <b>a</b> {{very nice}} little fellow; and if God has not <b>given</b> <b>you</b> health and strength, He has <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{disposition}} and <b>an</b> excellent heart and brain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Maria here {{put in a}} word, [...] "You do {{just what}} Hamlin tells you to do. If he wants to spend his money <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time, <b>you</b> let him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'God {{give you}} good morrow, Sir! Good morrow gossip: good morrow my she gossip: God <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> morrow {{and a good}} year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You’d {{find it hard}} to {{get another}} place at your age," [...] said his wife; [...] "especially if they wouldn’t <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "If {{we get this}} vessel safely to France, I will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance to try your nerves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not telling}} the truth!" [...] cried Ralph, indignantly. [...] "It was you who insulted me, and I <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal less than you {{deserved}} {{in the shape of}} a whipping for doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess he's got a {{great many}} {{important}} things shut up inside of him," [...] said Mr. Lincoln, banteringly. [...] "But he <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> recommendation, Sherman. He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked you and called you 'Uncle Billy.' And I told him {{that was the best}} recommendation he could give anybody." ...|$|R
60|$|MAUD. [Hurriedly, in <b>a</b> panic.] I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> reason--a--a <b>good</b> one. I--I--am not Harry Jones.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{signs of}} the boat--look well into the bay of Naples--we are opening Campanella now {{sufficiently}} to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look up toward the head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} that two hundred acres of land will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal to do;--that is if you mean to make money by it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Asaph," [...] said Mrs. Himes, [...] "if I were to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> suit of clothes, {{would you}} promise {{me that you}} would never smoke when wearing them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, my child. But {{first let}} me tell you, that about this time there arrived in the port, a cabin-full of French emigrants of quality;--poor people, Pierre, who were forced to fly from their native land, because of the cruel, blood-shedding times there. But you have read all that in the little history I <b>gave</b> <b>you,</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> while ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shucks!" [...] {{returned}} Harding. [...] "I don't give what I can't afford. You and Fred {{have helped}} to put me where I am, and I'd have felt mean if I hadn't <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start off when I'm going to spend money recklessly on another plan. Now that all I need for the summer's paid for, I've been doing some figuring." ...|$|R
60|$|Don't {{you ever}} come to New York again and not run up here to see me. I Suppose we were away for the summer when you were East; but no matter, you could have telegraphed and found out. We were at Elmira N. Y. and right on your road, and could have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time if <b>you</b> had allowed us the chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's your room," [...] said Rosie, {{setting down}} the candle on the table, [...] "and now I'm going to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> spanking {{before you go}} to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} to come, I'll take you," [...] he said. [...] "If I don't want you myself, I think I can promise to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But the Inspector {{examines}} them in {{the three}} R's, mind you, and he won't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> report if they don't come up to his standard," [...] protested Jane.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my lad," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, {{shaking his}} head slowly, [...] "but what's broke can never be whole again; it 'ud be your doing, not mine." [...] Then looking up at him, [...] "You're only sixteen; it's an up-hill fight for you, but you mustn't throw it at your father; the raskills have been too many for him. I've <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> eddication,--that'll start you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are here, Dare," [...] he said. [...] "I saw Mr. Williams {{last night and}} he <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> recommendation. But he was almost afraid you had not had enough {{experience}} in the retail trade to take charge, which just at present {{you would have to}} do, because I must go to Philadelphia by the first afternoon train by the latest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Glad you saw {{and liked}} Lysaght. He has left {{in our house}} a most cheerful and {{pleasing}} memory, as <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> pleasant, brisk fellow with good health and brains, and who enjoys himself and makes other people happy. I am glad he <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> report of our surroundings and way of life; but I knew he would, for I believe he had a glorious time--and gave one.[78] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{bring those}} bottles of champagne," [...] he urged; [...] "don't {{be hard on}} me, Klara. I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time to-night, and a nice present into the bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, it's a tolerably big country, {{and folks}} forget. You might, at least, go so far, and that would, after all, <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal--a competence, {{the right to}} marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} have given me a station I should have liked better; and I hope, ere long, I {{may be able to}} <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> account of the bush rangers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} would not," [...] {{returned}} Nigel, quickly. [...] "Forgive me, Moses, I merely meant {{that you would have}} to be very cautious--very careful--that you do not let a word slip--by accident, you know--I believe you'd sooner die than do an intentional injury to Van der Kemp. If I thought you capable of that, I think I would relieve my feelings by <b>giving</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thrashing." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw the Lady Hesther Stanhope [2] at Athens, {{and do not}} admire [...] "that [...] {{dangerous}} thing a female wit." [...] She told me (take her own words) that [...] she had <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> set-down at Malta, in some disputation about [...] the Navy; from this, of course, I readily inferred the contrary, or in [...] the words of an acquaintance of ours, that [...] "you had the best of it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to observe that even in England you will eat the most {{carefully}} ordered meal with an indifference which is an outrage to decency. Indeed, you pay less attention to it than here, because at all events you do notice that the meat is mouldy. But if any one <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dinner, <b>you</b> notice nothing. I've given him priceless port, Doctor, and he drank it {{as though it were}} cooking sherry.|$|R
