50|$|In India, Varanasi, {{also known}} as Banaras, {{is one of the}} major {{manufacturers}} of <b>Dupion.</b> Weavers of nearby villagers, mainly of the Ansari community, have been producing fabrics for generations. The major demands of the Indian wedding industry are met this city.|$|E
50|$|Dupioni (also {{referred}} to as Douppioni or <b>Dupion)</b> is a plain weave crisp type of silk fabric, produced by using fine thread in the warp and uneven thread reeled from two or more entangled cocoons in the weft. This creates tightly-woven yardage with a highly-lustrous surface. It is similar to shantung, but slightly thicker, heavier, and with a greater slub (cross-wise irregularity) count.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work an attempt {{has been made}} to develop Bio-composite Material using raw <b>dupion</b> silk fiber {{reinforced}} vinylester matrix in addition with gelatin as filler material with varying percentage using hand lay-up method. The experiments namely tensile, flexural and hardness test were conducted on the standard samples prepared. An appreciable improvement was found in the mechanical properties of the Bio-composite, which can be used for variety of applications in the human bone replacement. The biocomposites were prepared in varying percentage of filler addition (0...|$|E
40|$|In {{composites}} a conglomeration produces {{material properties}} which are unavailable from individual constituent materials. The use of petroleum based products as constituents in polymer matrix composite has raised concerns regarding environmental issue and non -renewability of the resource. Therefore {{in this work}} an attempt {{has been made to}} develop a biocomposite material using untreated <b>dupion</b> silk fiber as reinforcement material and vinyl ester as matrix material with Potato Starch used as filler material by hand layup technique. The biocomposites were prepared in varying percentage of filler addition (0...|$|E
