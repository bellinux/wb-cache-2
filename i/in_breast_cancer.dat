5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

The decrease <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> rates has continued in subsequent years. An unknown number of women started taking alternatives to Prempro, such as bioidentical hormones, though scientists have asserted that such hormones are not significantly different from Prempro.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> CD44+CD24−/low {{cells are}} {{detectable}} in metastatic pleural effusions.

It is possible that CD44+CD24−/low cells initially metastasize and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue and persist in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (Figure 7).|$|E

5000|$|In mammals, microRNAs (miRNAs) {{regulate}} the transcriptional activity of about 60% of protein-encoding genes.

30|$|Approximately 40 % {{of breast}} {{carcinoma}} cases {{and more than}} half of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths were due to <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed after the screening age.

In both settings, there were very few deaths due to in situ carcinoma. Also the proportion of deaths due to screen-detected cancers was small compared to the proportion they represented in the distribution of cancers (7 % vs. 23 %) whereas the proportion of deaths due to <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> among non-attendants (7 % vs. 6 %) and due to interval <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> (9 % vs. 12 %) was more or less similar to that of cancer distribution.|$|R

40|$|Background: The role of S 100 A 7 <b>in</b> ER <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is not known. Results: S 100 A 7 {{overexpression}} <b>in</b> ER <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cells inhibits tumorigenesis by decreasing -catenin and TCF 4 expres-sion through {{activation of}} GSK 3 and E-cadherin. Conclusion: S 100 A 7 may regulate tumorigenesis through modulation of the -catenin/TCF 4 pathway. Significance: S 100 A 7 may possess differential activity in ER compared with ER cells, as S 100 A 7 {{has been shown}} to enhance tumorigenesis in ER cells. Psoriasin (S 100 A 7) is expressed in several epithelial malig-nancies including <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Although S 100 A 7 is associated with the worst prognosis in estrogen receptor -negative (ER) invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancers,</b> its role <b>in</b> ER-positive (ER) <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> is relatively unknown.

25|$|Trastuzumab, a {{monoclonal}} antibody to HER2 (a cell receptor that is especially active in some breast cancer cells), has improved the 5-year disease free survival of stage 1–3 HER2-positive breast cancers to about 87% (overall survival 95%). When stimulated by certain growth factors, HER2 causes cellular growth and division; {{in the absence}} of stimulation by the growth factor, the cell will normally stop growing. Between 25% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 gene or its protein product, and overexpression of HER2 <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. When trastuzumab binds to the HER2 <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cells that overexpress the receptor, trastuzumab prevents growth factors from being able to bind to and stimulate the receptors, effectively blocking the growth of the cancer cells. Trastuzumab, however, is very expensive, and its use may cause serious side effects (approximately 2% of patients who receive it suffer significant heart damage). Further, trastuzumab is only effective in patients with HER2 amplification/overexpression.|$|E
40|$|Poly(ADP-ribose) {{polymerase}} 1 (PARP) is a {{key element}} of the single-base excision pathway for repair of DNA single-strand breaks. To compare the cytoplasmic and nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) expression between familial (BRCA 1, BRCA 2, or non BRCA 1 / 2) and sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> we investigated 39 sporadic and 39 familial <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cases. The two groups were matched for hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Additionally, they were matched by grading with a maximum difference of +/- 1 degree (e. g., G 2 instead of G 3). Cytoplasmic PARP (cPARP) expression was significantly higher in familial compared to sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> (P = 0. 008, chi-squared test for trends) and a high nuclear PARP expression (nPARP) was significantly more frequently observed <b>in</b> familial <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> (64 %) compared with sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> (36 %) (P = 0. 005, chi-squared test).
