40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an inquiry}} {{into the nature of}} the Deity in view of <b>human</b> <b>relationships.</b> <b>Human</b> <b>relationships</b> exist and are definitive {{of what it means to}} exist as a human. In this sense, human relating is an inherent aspect of the experience of humanity, i. e., they are inescapable. Does the Christian doctrine of Trinity or Islam 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine of Tawhidic (monadic) Allah more adequately account for the existence of <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> and their inescapability? This question is analyzed by comparing the Tawhidic nature of Allah with the Trinitarian nature of God in order to evaluate and clarify which doctrine is the best explanation for <b>human</b> <b>relationships.</b> Thus, this is an abductive argument, inferring from the evidence to the best explanation. By first reflecting on how humanity exists in terms of oneness, distinctness, and relatedness, the doctrine of Tawhidic Allah is investigated to observe how well it grounds these aspects of <b>human</b> <b>relationships.</b> Then, the same is done concerning the Trinity 2 ̆ 7 s ability to ground these. The conclusion compares and contrasts the Trinity and Allah to explain which one better accounts for <b>human</b> <b>relationships.</b> Following this conclusion, there are a number of ramifications that are discussed...|$|R
40|$|All <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> {{involve some}} form of cost and benefit and {{altruism}} forms the foundation upon which <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> are built. In this paper, a taxonomy of <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> in terms of altruism was constructed. In the proposed taxonomy, <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> are categorized into three major groups: primary group, secondary group, and tertiary group. The primary group consists of members that are very closely {{related to each other}} either by genetic relatedness (e. g., parents, siblings, and cousins) or social relatedness (e. g., mate and close friends) or both. The secondary group consists of members that are socially related but also less closely related with each other (e. g., people of the same political or religious group, teachers, mentors, acquaintances, neighbors, working colleagues, and strangers). Lastly, the tertiary group consists of members of other species. A 10 -stage theory of altruism with special reference to <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> is proposed. The affective, cognitive, and relationship aspects of each stage are delineated in details. There are two developmental principles of altruism. The first principle states that the development of altruism follows the 10 -stage theory and moves from Stage 1 : Egoism toward the higher stages of altruism slowly. The second developmental principle states that the taxonomy of <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> is valid at any stage of altruism development. In other words, people at any stage of altruism are more altruistic toward their kin and mate, and then close friends, extended family members, and so on. They are least altruistic toward enemies and members of non-human species. In summary, the proposed developmental principle of altruism and <b>human</b> <b>relationships</b> is logical and robust. It is formulated based on the major developmental and social psychological theories. The theory has the potential in providing a useful framework for future studies on the development and evolution of <b>human</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
25|$|Most early Tamil {{literary}} works are in verse form, with prose not {{becoming more common}} until later periods. The Sangam literature collection contains 2381 poems composed by 473 poets, some 102 of whom remain anonymous. Sangam literature is primarily secular, dealing with everyday themes in a Tamilakam context. The Sangam literature also deals with <b>human</b> <b>relationship</b> and emotions. The available literature from this period was categorised and compiled in the 10th century into two categories based roughly on chronology.

25|$|Since crows and magpies {{have benefited}} and even {{increased}} in numbers due to human development, {{it was suggested}} that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined American crows, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened marbled murrelets. However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than American crows and common ravens. Therefore, the <b>human</b> <b>relationship</b> with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as habitat destruction. Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between Eurasian magpie numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.|$|E

What I {{meant to}} say was, in each phase of life {{you have a great}} circuit of <b>human</b> <b>relationship</b> to establish and fulfill. In childhood, it is the circuit of family love, established at the first four consciousness centers, and gradually fulfilling itself, completing itself. At adolescence, the first circuit of family love should be completed, dynamically finished. And then, it falls into quiescence. After puberty, family love should fall quiescent in a child. The love never breaks. It continues static and basic, the basis of the emotional psyche, the foundation of the self. It is like the moon when the moon at last subsides into her eternal orbit, round the earth. She travels in her orbit so inevitably that she forgets, and becomes unaware. She only knits her brows over the earth's greater aberrations in space.|$|E
60|$|Edith's {{home was}} more prosperous than Mary's; {{she brought her}} own money to it; the {{bringing}} up of her children was a far more efficient business than Mary's instinctive proceedings. Hugh had very nearly died {{in his first year}} of life; some summer infection had snatched at him; that had tied him to his father's heart by a knot of fear; but no infection had ever come near Edith's own nursery. And it was Hugh that Mr. Britling had seen, small and green-faced and pitiful under an anaesthetic for some necessary small operation to his adenoids. His younger children had never stabbed to Mr. Britling's heart with any such pitifulness; they were not so thin-skinned as their elder brother, not so assailable by the little animosities of dust and germ. And out of such things as this evolved a shapeless cloud of championship for Hugh. Jealousies and suspicions are latent in every <b>human</b> <b>relationship.</b> We go about the affairs of life pretending magnificently that they are not so, pretending to the generosities we desire. And in all step-relationships jealousy and suspicion are not merely latent, they stir.|$|E

We have tried to show something of the share of the great winds of Arab curiosity and Mongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of Europe. And at first it was chiefly material knowledge that increased. The first fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material achievements and material power. The science of <b>human</b> <b>relationship,</b> of individual and social psychology, of education and of economics, are not only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up inextricably with much emotional matter. The advances made in them have been slower and made against greater opposition. Men will listen dispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or molecules, but ideas about our ways of life touch and reflect upon everyone about us.|$|E

60|$|From 1918 onward {{the world}} entered upon {{an age of}} conferences. Of these the Conference at Washington called by President Harding (1921) {{has been the most}} {{successful}} and suggestive. Notable, too, is the Genoa Conference (1922) for the appearance of German and Russian delegates at its deliberations. We will not discuss this long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail. It becomes more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of reconstruction has to be done by mankind if a crescendo of such convulsions and world massacres as that of the great war is to be averted. No such hasty improvisation as the League of Nations, no patched-up system of Conferences between this group of states and that, which change nothing with an air of settling everything, will meet the complex political needs of the new age that lies before us. A systematic development and a systematic application of the sciences of <b>human</b> <b>relationship,</b> of personal and group psychology, of financial and economic science and of education, sciences still only in their infancy, is required. Narrow and obsolete, dead and dying moral and political ideas have {{to be replaced by a}} clearer and a simpler conception of the common origins and destinies of our kind.|$|E
6000|$|These sombre meditations hardly {{represent}} Diderot's habitual vein; {{they are}} rather a reaction and a {{relief from the}} busy intensity with which he watches the scene, and is constantly putting interrogatories to human life, as day by day its motley circumstance passes before his eyes. We should scarcely suspect from his frequent repetitions of the mournful eternal chorus of the nullity of man and the vanity {{of all the things}} that are under the sun, how alert a watch he kept on incident and character, with what keen and open ear he listened for any curious note of pain, or voice of fine emotion, or odd perversity of fate. All this he does, not in the hard temper of a Balzac, not with the calm or pride of a Goethe, but with an overflowing fulness of spontaneous and uncontrollable sympathy. He is a sentimentalist in the rationalistic century, not with the sentimentalism of misanthropy, such as fired or soured Rousseau, but social, large-hearted, many-sided, careless of the wise rigours of morality. He is never callous nor neutral; on the contrary, he is always approving or disapproving, but not from the standards of the ethical text-books. The casuistry of feeling is of everlasting interest to him, and he is never tired of inventing imaginary cases, or pondering real ones, in which pliant feeling is invoked against the narrowness of duty. These are mostly in a kind of matter which modern taste hardly allows us to reproduce; nor, after all, is there much to be gained by turning the sanctities of <b>human</b> <b>relationship,</b> with all their immeasurable bliss, their immeasurable woe, into the playthings of an idle dialectic. It is pleasanter, and for us English not less instructive than pleasant, to see this dreaming, restless, thrice ingenious spirit, half Titan of the skies, half gnome of the lower earth, entering joyously or pitifully into the simple charm and natural tenderness of life as it comes and passes. Nothing delights him more than to hear or to tell such a story as this of Madame D'Epinay. She had given a small lad eighteen sous for a day's work. At night he went home without a farthing. When his mother asked him whether they had given him nothing for his work, he said No. The mother found out that this was untrue, and insisted on knowing what had become of the eighteen sous. The poor little creature had given them to an alehouse-keeper, where his father had been drinking all day; and so he had spared the worthy man a rough scene with his wife when he got home.[207] ...|$|E
6000|$|A very {{interesting}} case to discuss {{in relation to}} this question of adjustment {{is that of the}} barrister. A practising barrister under contemporary conditions does indeed give most typically the opportunity for examining the relation of an ordinary self-respecting worldly life, to life under the dispensation of God discovered. A barrister is usually a man of some energy and ambition, his honour is moulded by the traditions of an ancient and antiquated profession, instinctively self-preserving and yet with a real desire for consistency and respect. As a profession it has been greedy and defensively conservative, but it has never been shameless nor has it ever broken faith with its own large and selfish, but quite definite, propositions. It has never for instance had the shamelessness of such a traditionless and undisciplined class as the early factory organisers. It has never had the dull incoherent wickedness of the sort of men who exploit drunkenness and the turf. It offends within limits. Barristers can be, and are, disbarred. But it is now a profession extraordinarily out of date; its code of honour derives from a time of cruder and lower conceptions of <b>human</b> <b>relationship.</b> It apprehends the State as a mere [...] "ring" [...] kept about private disputations; it has not begun to move towards the modern conception of the collective enterprise as the determining criterion of human conduct. It sees its business as a mere play upon the rules of a game between man and man, or between men and men. They haggle, they dispute, they inflict and suffer wrongs, they evade dues, and are liable or entitled to penalties and compensations. The primary business of the law is held to be decision in these wrangles, and as wrangling is subject to artistic elaboration, the business of the barrister is the business of a professional wrangler; he is a bravo in wig and gown who fights the duels of ordinary men because they are incapable, very largely on account of the complexities of legal procedure, of fighting for themselves. His business is never to explore any fundamental right in the matter. His business is to say all that can be said for his client, and to conceal or minimise whatever can be said against his client. The successful promoted advocate, who in Britain and the United States of America is the judge, and whose habits and interests all incline him to disregard the realities of the case in favour of the points in the forensic game, then adjudicates upon the contest.

6000|$|Many people, {{whom one}} would class as rather liberal Christians of an Arian or Arminian complexion, {{may find the}} larger part of this book {{acceptable}} to them if they will read [...] "the Christ God" [...] where the writer has written [...] "God." [...] They will then differ from him upon {{little more than the}} question whether there is an essential identity in aim and quality between the Christ God and the Veiled Being, who answer to their Creator God. This the orthodox post Nicaean Christians assert, and many pre-Nicaeans and many heretics (as the Cathars) contradicted with its exact contrary. The Cathars, Paulicians, Albigenses and so on held, with the Manichaeans, that the God of Nature, God the Father, was evil. The Christ God was his antagonist. This was the idea of the poet Shelley. And passing beyond Christian theology altogether a clue can still be found to many problems in comparative theology in this distinction between the Being of Nature (cf. Kant's [...] "starry vault above") and the God of the heart (Kant's [...] "moral law within"). The idea of an antagonism seems to have been cardinal in the thought of the Essenes and the Orphic cult and in the Persian dualism. So, too, Buddhism seems to be [...] "antagonistic." [...] On the other hand, the Moslem teaching and modern Judaism seem absolutely to combine and identify the two; God the creator is altogether and without distinction also God the King of Mankind. Christianity stands somewhere between such complete identification and complete antagonism. It admits a difference in attitude between Father and Son in its distinction between the Old Dispensation (of the Old Testament) and the New. Every possible change is rung in the great religions of the world between identification, complete separation, equality, and disproportion of these Beings; but it will be found that these two ideas are, so to speak, the basal elements of all theology in the world. The writer is chary of assertion or denial in these matters. He believes that they are speculations not at all necessary to salvation. He believes that men may differ profoundly in their opinions upon these points and still be in perfect agreement upon the essentials of religion. The reality of religion he believes deals wholly and exclusively with the God of the Heart. He declares as his own opinion, and as the opinion which seems most expressive of modern thought, that {{there is no reason to}} suppose the Veiled Being either benevolent or malignant towards men. But if the reader believes that God is Almighty and in every way Infinite the practical outcome is not very different. For the purposes of <b>human</b> <b>relationship</b> it is impossible to deny that God PRESENTS HIMSELF AS FINITE, as struggling and taking a part against evil.|$|E
6000|$|I will go further, {{and admit}} that the brass plates may not all be frauds. I {{will tell you that}} one of my friends was led to genuine love and {{considerable}} knowledge of classical literature by an Irish schoolmaster whom you would call a hedge schoolmaster (he {{would not be allowed to}} teach anything now) and that it took four years of Harrow to obliterate that knowledge and change the love into loathing. Another friend of mine who keeps a school in the suburbs, and who deeply deplores my [...] "prejudice against schoolmasters," [...] has offered to accept my challenge to tell his pupils that they are as free to get up and go out of the school at any moment as their parents are to get up and go out of a theatre where my plays are being performed. Even among my own schoolmasters I can recollect a few whose classes interested me, and whom I should certainly have pestered for information and instruction if I could have got into any decent <b>human</b> <b>relationship</b> with them, and if they had not been compelled by their position to defend themselves as carefully against such advances as against furtive attempts to hurt them accidentally in the football field or smash their hats with a clod from behind a wall. But these rare cases actually do more harm than good; for they encourage us to pretend that all schoolmasters are like that. Of what use is it to us that there are always somewhere two or three teachers of children whose specific genius for their occupation triumphs over our tyrannous system and even finds in it its opportunity? For that matter, it is possible, if difficult, to find a solicitor, or even a judge, who has some notion of what law means, a doctor with a glimmering of science, an officer who understands duty and discipline, and a clergyman with an inkling of religion, though there are nothing like enough of them to go round. But even the few who, like Ibsen's Mrs Solness, have [...] "a genius for nursing the souls of little children" [...] are like angels forced to work in prisons instead of in heaven; and even at that they are mostly underpaid and despised. That friend of mine who went from the hedge schoolmaster to Harrow once saw a schoolmaster rush from an elementary school in pursuit of a boy and strike him. My friend, not considering that the unfortunate man was probably goaded beyond endurance, smote the schoolmaster and blackened his eye. The schoolmaster appealed to the law; and my friend found himself waiting nervously in the Hammersmith Police Court to answer for his breach of the peace. In his anxiety he asked a police officer what would happen to him. [...] "What did you do?" [...] said the officer. [...] "I gave a man a black eye" [...] said my friend. [...] "Six pounds if he was a gentleman: two pounds if he wasnt," [...] said the constable. [...] "He was a schoolmaster" [...] said my friend. [...] "Two pounds" [...] said the officer; and two pounds it was. The blood money was paid cheerfully; and I have ever since advised elementary schoolmasters to qualify themselves in the art of self-defence, as the British Constitution expresses our national estimate of them by allowing us to blacken three of their eyes for the same price as one of an ordinary professional man. How many Froebels and Pestalozzis and Miss Masons and Doctoress Montessoris would you be likely to get on these terms even if they occurred much more frequently in nature than they actually do? ...|$|E
