5000|$|However, {{the main}} bass Doug {{used for the}} {{majority}} of his career was a heavily modified pre-CBS era Fender Jazz Bass. The instrument was {{one of only a handful}} custom modified by various technicians in the early 1970s. It contained 3 passive pickups instead of usual two as seen on a stock Fender Jazz Bass. The 3 pickups were a Gibson EB0 neck humbucking pickup (a.k.a. [...] "mudbucker") in the neck position, a stock Fender Precision Bass humbucker in the middle position, and a stock Fender Jazz Bass single coil bridge pickup in the bridge position. A non-original knob and two white switches were also installed above the <b>jack</b> <b>plate.</b> Around 1974-1975 Doug was seen with blue lights installed in the neck. It is unknown if the lights were a modification to the original instrument, or in fact a new instrument altogether.|$|E

50|$|The jack {{is similar}} to the brigandine. The main {{difference}} is in the method of construction: a brigandine is riveted whereas a jack is sewn. <b>Jacks</b> of <b>plate</b> were created by stitching small overlapping squares of iron in between two canvases. The garments weighed about 17 pounds, which made them much more pleasing to wear than solid breastplates. They allowed soldiers with weapons to rest the butts of the weapons firmly against their shoulders, which wasn't feasible with smooth surface plate armours. The present day equivalent of a <b>jack</b> of <b>plate</b> is a bullet-proof vest. Jacks were often made from recycled pieces of older plate armor, including damaged brigandines and cuirasses cut into small squares.|$|R
50|$|After being {{replaced}} by plate armour among the elite, similar garments can still {{be found in the}} 15th century, as the brigandine. Another similar but later garment was the coat or <b>Jack</b> of <b>plate</b> which remained in use {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|R
5000|$|The Rickenbacker 330 {{is part of}} Rickenbacker's 300 {{series of}} guitars, the series for which Rickenbacker is perhaps best known. The 330 entered the Rickenbacker product line in 1958, though {{at the time the}} 300 series of guitars was known as the [...] "Capri" [...] series. It was {{designed}} by the German luthier Roger Rossmeisl. The guitar is associated by many players with the jangle-rock sounds of bands from the 1960s and 1980s. The instrument incorporates many features standard on Rickenbacker guitars, including a three-ply maple/walnut neck, a shallow headstock angle, and a thick rosewood fretboard finished with clear conversion varnish. The 330 also features a body with Rickenbacker's [...] "crescent moon" [...] double-cutaway shape with sharp, unbound edges, and an [...] "R"-shaped trapeze tailpiece. One idiosyncrasy of the guitar is its dual truss rods, which allow for the correction of problematic and unwanted twists, as well as curvature, of the guitar's neck. The 330 is equipped with a monaural <b>jack</b> <b>plate,</b> lacking the Rick-O-Sound stereo functionality of other Rickenbacker models such as the Rickenbacker 360.|$|E
5000|$|A similar type of armour was the <b>jack</b> of <b>plates</b> or coat of plates, {{commonly}} referred to simply as a [...] "jack" [...] (although this could also refer to any outer garment). This type of armour was used by common Medieval European soldiers and the rebel peasants known as Jacquerie.|$|R

5000|$|In the Three's Company episode [...] "Opening Night," [...] (November 16, 1982) Larry Dallas invites his family, {{visiting from}} Greece, to Jacks Bistro. The large family {{gathering}} {{ends with the}} Greek celebratory custom of the breaking of plates. Reluctant at first {{because of all the}} money it will cost to replace the <b>plates,</b> <b>Jack</b> joins in the celebration when Larry says they will cover the bill for each <b>plate.</b> <b>Jack</b> then looks at Janet who shows him the final cost of all the plates that were broken. Jack, while clenching the remaining two plates he owns, throws them {{up in the air and}} says [...] "Opa!" [...] and lets them break as well.|$|R
5000|$|Jack {{comes over}} again and Jerry returns the pen. Morty berates Jack for [...] "taking Jerry's pen". Elaine decides she {{wants to take the}} muscle relaxants, but takes a slight {{overdose}} and acts goofily at the ceremony. Jerry has to wear sunglasses because of his black eyes. At the dinner, Uncle Leo and Aunt Stella arrive to watch the event. Jack is the MC and turns the dinner into a [...] "roast", making cracks about Morty at the podium. Morty starts arguing with Jack again about taking back the pen and they start fighting, breaking <b>Jack's</b> dental <b>plate</b> in the process, prompting a bitter Jack to sue Morty.|$|R
50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw <b>jack</b> and foot <b>plate.</b> The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the lifting frame trunnion axis to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|R
50|$|Keystone modules have a {{rectangular}} face of 14.5 mm wide by 16.0 mm high and {{are held in}} place with flexible tabs. This allows them to be snapped into a mounting plate with correspondingly-sized rectangular holes, called ports. All keystones, regardless {{of the type of}} jack they carry, are interchangeable and replaceable. This provides much flexibility in arranging and mounting many different types of electrical <b>jacks</b> in one <b>plate</b> or panel without requiring customized manufacturing.|$|R
5000|$|The ES-345 {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1958 as an upscale {{version of the}} ES-335. Although the design {{is very similar to}} the 335, the 345 featured a multi-position [...] "Varitone" [...] switch located just above the lead tone and volume controls, which added various combinations of inductors and capacitors to the electronic pickup circuit of the guitar in order to alter its resonant frequency and add [...] "color" [...] to the sound. The ES-345 also featured an optional stereophonic output <b>jack,</b> gold <b>plated</b> hardware, large split parallelogram fingerboard inlays (similar to ES 175), and a thicker three-ply edge binding than that of the ES-335. Notable users were B.B. King, Freddie King, Bill Nelson, John McLaughlin, Jorma Kaukonen, Fred Frith, Porl Thompson of The Cure, Steve Howe, Elvin Bishop and the character of Marty McFly in the 1985 comedy film Back To The Future.|$|R
5000|$|Sound Blaster Audigy 4 Pro (November 2004) was an Audigy 2 ZS with updated DACs and ADCs, the new DAC {{being the}} Cirrus Logic CS4398, {{boosting}} the output SNR to 113 dB. Other than a breakout box, {{it has no}} distinguishable difference from the Audigy 2 ZS. The DSP {{is identical to the}} Audigy 2 ZS's but Creative put an [...] "Audigy 4" [...] sticker to cover the chip, making it appear as if it is a new chip. The Audigy 4 Pro is {{not to be confused with}} the Audigy 4 (Value) which contains lower quality DACs and does not have golden <b>plated</b> <b>jacks.</b> The Audigy 4 (Value) is more in line with the Audigy 2 Value series. The Audigy 4 had a shorter life span than its predecessors, due to the short window between it and the next-generation Sound Blaster X-Fi.|$|R
6000|$|Reichel himself came to see, {{before his}} regretted death, {{that he could}} not explain away the thorex or corslet, on his {{original}} lines, as a mere general name for [...] "a piece of armour"; and he inclined to think that <b>jacks,</b> with metal <b>plates</b> sewn on, did exist before the Ionian corslet. [Footnote: Homerische Waffen, pp. 93-94. 1901.] The gold breastplates of the Mycenaean graves pointed in this direction. But his general argument is that corslets were interpolated into the old lays by poets of a corslet-wearing age; and Mr. Leaf holds that corslets may have filtered in, [...] "during the course of successive modernisation, such as the oldest parts of the Iliad seem in many cases to have passed through," [...] [Footnote: Leaf, Iliad, i. p. 578.] though the new poets were, for all that, [...] "conservatively tenacious of the old material." [...] We have already pointed out the difficulty.|$|R
40|$|For {{determination}} of the in-situ deformation modulus of rock mass at Bakhtiari Dam site, located in south-west of Iran, <b>plate</b> <b>jacking</b> tests (PJT) and dilatometer tests (DLT) carried out during the geotechnical investigations. In this study, the results of PJTs and DLTs were compared. This comparison involves 89 vertical and horizontal PJTs and 83 DLTs carried out in 6 rock units of Sarvak formation. Although, both PJTs and DLTs in the Bakhtiari Dam site were performed in same geological and geotechnical conditions, but there are not sufficient side by side data to make a paired two samples correlation. Therefore, the mean of in-situ data was compared at each rock unit. Besides Mannâ€“Whitney U tests were performed to compare in-situ test results. The comparison shows that the deformation modulus measured by both methods has no significant differences. However, in low quality rock masses the moduli measured {{by the use of}} DLTs were greater than the modulus measured by PJTs. Conversely, in high quality rock masses the results of PJTs were greater than DLTâ€™s...|$|R
