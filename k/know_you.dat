5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but feel that I have no need to do so. I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active listening as originated by Gordon and empathic listening {{as recommended by}} Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said to let them <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing {{with the needs of}} the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|If {{you have}} free {{will to do}} other than X {{we can make the}} moral {{judgment}} that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.|$|E
25|$|Since it puts {{a premium}} on {{conscious}} understanding of the case, the party restricts membership to those who can pass a membership test on the party’s policies and principles. For example, the satirist John Bird is quoted as saying, I {{was a member of}} something called the Socialist Party of Great Britain at school for a while. You had to pass an exam, you <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> could not just join.|$|E
25|$|And {{that the}} Church of Christ consisteth of meane persons, is no wonder; for wee have learned, that the poore receive the Gospell, and you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have granted, that it stands {{with the light}} and Law of Nature, That the liberty, power, and rule, {{should be in the}} whole, and not in one man or a few; so that the power must rest in the body; and not in the Officers, though the Church be never so poore.|$|E

25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned burnt-out buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back and watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E
25|$|For a {{few years}} we've been {{trying to come up}} with a way for the readers of this site to connect and {{interact}} with each other, to get to know each other better, for me to get to <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better, and for little bunnies to fart sunshine. The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better.|$|E

I <b>knew</b> <b>thee</b> helpful, <b>knew</b> <b>thee</b> true, <b>knew</b> <b>thee</b> And Pity bedfellows: I heard thy talk With answerable throbbings. On the stream, Deep, swift, and clear, the lilies floated; fish Through the shadows ran. There, thou and I Read Kindness in our eyes and closed the match.|$|R

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but feel I have no need to do so.
