5|$|In the 20th century, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{led to the}} consideration of geothermal power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was built there. It was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until New Zealand built a plant in 1958. In 2012, it produced some 594 megawatts.|$|E
5|$|Many of New Zealand’s geysers {{have been}} {{destroyed}} by humans in the last century. Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means. The main remaining field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the Ohakuri hydroelectric dam in 1961. The Wairakei field was lost to a <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in 1958. The Taupo Spa field was lost when the Waikato River level was deliberately altered in the 1950s. The Rotomahana field was destroyed by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} the second most used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{report is}} the first to study and discuss the effect of water supply {{problems}} of geothermal development. Geothermal energy resources have the potential of making a significant contribution to the U. S. energy supply situation, especially at the regional and local levels where the resources are located. A significant issue of concern is the availability and cost of water for use in a <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> operation primarily because <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> require large quantities of water for cooling, sludge handling and the operation of environmental control systems. On a per unit basis, <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> because of their inherent high heat rejection rates, have cooling requirements several times greater than the conventional fossil fuel plants and therefore the supply of water is a critical factor in the planning, designing, and siting of <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> However, no studies have been specifically performed to identify the water requirements of <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> the underlying causes of water availability problems, and available techniques to alleviate some of these problems. There is no cost data included in the report. The report includes some descriptions of known geothermal areas. [DJE- 2005...|$|R
40|$|The Icelandic {{transmission}} system {{has one of}} the highest ratios of installed capacity of <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in the world, as it covers 25 % of the total capacity. The current frequency controls of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are outdated and needs to be revised in order to improve the frequency regulation of the industry-intensive power system. Consequently, the stability of the system is more vulnerable and the risk of island operation and load shedding is increased. In this thesis the frequency controls of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> has been analysed with both simulations and real-time measurements. The Icelandic PSS/E model was used for dynamic simulations of the system. As a result, several improvements of the governor model responses were suggested. Revised frequency control strategies based on wide area monitoring and control systems has been investigated. The results suggested that customized control strategies should be used for each of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> in order to improve their active power support capability during dynamic events and to secure the system stability. Some system scenarios require more frequency regulation from the <b>geothermal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> while for other conditions a blocking of the regulation participation is more favourable. Finally, the results suggest that the real-time implementation of the wide-area control schemes, i. e. measurements, data processing and control outputs, should be based on a single application platform, in order to guarantee reliability and uniformity in the operation...|$|R
