40|$|A newly <b>developed</b> <b>deposit</b> at the Inspiration Mine has ore {{consisting}} {{of black and}} green chrysocolla. No primary copper minerals occur within the deposit. The chryso-colla is partly in rocks that are younger than the nearby major copper mineralization. We believe the chrysocolla was produced by reaction of soluble copper with silica dissolved from the volcanic glasses in the adjacent quartz-latite floxvs of the Apache Leap Formation. This is probably not a unique occurrence. Thus, chrysocolla deposits {{may be expected to}} be associated with other silica-rich flows located near sources of copper. Conversely, deposits of chrysocolla exposed at the surface may be used to locate the primary source of copper by tracing old water courses back to the primary sulfide deposits. Black chrysocolla is a manganese-rich variety of green chrysocolla (as opposed to melaconite, copper pitch, and tenoritc). Its X-ray properties are indistinguishable from the green variety. Results of thermal studies show that there is a greater similarity between the green and black varieties at a given deposit, than between specimens of like color from different deposits...|$|E

Fractional reserve banking, he tells us, (1) "has changed little over the centuries, " (2) "is inherently unstable, " and (3) "totally irrational". To preserve fractional reserve banking, despite these flaws, governments have <b>developed</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance and the lender of last resort function. He thinks a better solution would eliminate fractional reserve banking by requiring 100 % reserves. This change, he claims, would eliminate the inherent instability. I am not sure why he thinks the system has changed little or is irrational. Proposals for 100 % reserves systems have a long history. One reason {{that they have not}} been adopted is that bankers and depositors have incentives to share the private benefits of producing more loans and deposits from a given amount of reserves. Society can, of course, increase reserves at zero cost provided the country is on a fiduciary standard. This could be done by having the Central Bank issue reserves either as a pure transfer or by buying bonds from banks until all deposits have 100...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer {{disease is}} a dementing {{disorder}} characterized pathologically by Ab deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Although aged animals of many species spontaneously <b>develop</b> Ab <b>deposits,</b> only 2 species (chimpanzee and wolverine) {{have been reported to}} <b>develop</b> Ab <b>deposits</b> and neurofibrillary tangles in the same individual. Here, the authors demonstrate the spontaneous occurrence of Ab deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Among 22 cheetahs examined in this study, Ab deposits were observed in 13. Immunostaining (AT 8) revealed abnormal intracellular tau immunoreactivity in 10 of the cheetahs with Ab deposits, and they were mainly distributed in the parahippocampal cortex and CA 1 in a fashion similar to that in human patients with Alzheimer disease. Ultrastructurally, bundles of straight filaments filled the neuronal somata and axons, consistent with tangles. Interestingly, 2 of the cheetahs with the most severe abnormal tau immunoreactivity showed clinical cognitive dysfunction. The authors conclude that cheetahs spontaneously develop age-related neurodegenerative disease with pathologic changes similar to Alzheimer disease...|$|R
40|$|Decisions to <b>develop</b> <b>deposits</b> of {{calcareous}} {{materials for}} cement production are {{based largely on}} anticipated markets for heavy construction which utilizes concrete. The geol-ogist should understand the fundamental factors that underlie such management decisions, so that his field work and reports will more effectively relate to the information require-ments of managers in the cement industry. The paper examines the relationships that exist between exploration and development of calcareous raw materials for cement manufacture and changing factors in the marketing of cement. Continued overcapacity, improved technology, changing distribution pat-terns, ease of entry, economics of scale, {{and the nature of}} product demand are some of the characteristics of the cement industry that are basic to decisions regarding exploration programs and property development.
