40|$|ABSTRACT: The Daya Bay Antineutrino Detector {{gas system}} is {{designed}} to protect the liquid scin-tillator targets of the antineutrino detectors against degradation and contamination from exposure to ambient laboratory air. The gas system is also used to monitor the leak tightness of the antineu-trino detector assembly. The cover gas system constantly flushes the <b>gas</b> <b>volumes</b> above the liquid scintillator with dry nitrogen to minimize oxidation of the scintillator over the five year lifetime of the experiment. This constant flush also prevents the infiltration of radon or other contaminants into these detecting liquids keeping the internal backgrounds low. Since the Daya Bay antineutrino detectors are immersed in the large water pools of the muon veto system, other <b>gas</b> <b>volumes</b> are needed to protect vital detector cables or <b>gas</b> lines. These <b>volumes</b> are also purged with dry gas. Return gas is monitored for oxygen content and humidity to provide early warning of potentially damaging leaks.

25|$|Gunpowder, {{also known}} as black powder to {{distinguish}} it from modern smokeless gunpowder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer.

25|$|Another {{significant}} {{issue in}} open circuit scuba diver weighting {{is that the}} breathing gas is used up during a dive, and this gas has weight, so the total weight of the cylinder decreases, while its volume remains almost unchanged. As the diver needs to be neutral {{at the end of}} the dive, particularly at shallow depths for obligatory or safety decompression stops, sufficient ballast weight must be carried to allow for this reduction in weight of gas supply. (the density of air at normal atmospheric pressure is approximately 1.2kg/m3, or approximately 0.075lb/ft3) The amount of weight needed to compensate for gas use is easily calculable once the free <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> and density are known.|$|E
25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process.

Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small <b>gas</b> <b>volume,</b> or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E

25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a <b>gas</b> <b>volume.</b> When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E

By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) {{as well as by}} calculating the muon's original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon’s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2m x 2.5m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.|$|E

This may be done through an off-board supply connected to the BOV or through a regular fully independent bailout set carried for the purpose.
