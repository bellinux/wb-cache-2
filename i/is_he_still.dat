5|$|Lioba's emotionless state causes her to act less rationally and as {{a result}} the {{corporation}} stop her. It is deemed that she has to be deleted. Before this happens, John manages to find her and give her back her emotions. They agree to leave Planet B and meet up in real life. However, after they do, Lioba becomes ill and goes into a hospital, where John discovers that Medley is one of the staff. John discovers that not only <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> in Planet B, but Lioba has no physical body so she cannot leave. Lioba's illness comes from a patch designed to delete the rogues. John and Medley help to cure Lioba, and they unite in order to prevent more rogues from being destroyed. Cerberus then confronts them and battles with Medley, while John and Lioba flee to safety.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{had moved}} {{to work for the}} paper {{manufacturers}} Wiggins Teape and joined up in the Second World War. He served in the Berkshire Yeomanry and then the Household Cavalry. In 1940 he was ADC to Major-General Adrian Carton de Wiart during the Norway campaign. When he took part in Operation Overlord, Ford acquired the nickname [...] "Foghorn". A captured German officer, having heard him on the radio leading armoured cars advancing into Belgium, inquired after him: [...] "Excuse me, we have grown very fond of the British officer with the foghorn voice. We haven't heard him lately. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> alive?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu {{mentioned}} that the Shu general Jiang Wei also asked Xiahou Ba, [...] "Now that Sima Yi is {{in control of the}} Wei government, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> planning to launch any campaigns against Shu and Wu?" [...] Xiahou Ba replied, [...] "He focuses on strengthening his family's control of the Wei government and doesn't have time to bother about external affairs. However, there's one Zhong Shiji. He may be young, but he'll definitely become a threat to Wu and Shu in the future. Despite so, even the most extraordinary people can't control him." [...] Xiahou Ba was proven right 15 years later because Zhong Hui was one of the key figures in the Wei conquest of Shu.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a man}} of the Island of Hawaii, whom I shall call Keawe; for {{the truth}} <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> lives, and his name must be kept secret; but the place of his birth was not far from Honaunau, where the bones of Keawe the Great lie hidden in a cave. This man was poor, brave, and active; he could read and write like a schoolmaster; he was a first-rate mariner besides, sailed for some time in the island steamers, and steered a {{whaleboat}} on the Hamakua coast. At length it came in Keawe’s mind to have a sight of the great world and foreign cities, and he shipped on a vessel bound to San Francisco.|$|E

60|$|With all his advantages, however, Dolph {{made very}} slow {{progress}} in his art. This was {{no fault of}} the doctor's, certainly, for he took unwearied pains with the lad, keeping him close to the pestle and mortar, or on the trot about town with phials and pill-boxes; and if he ever flagged in his industry, which he was rather apt to do, the doctor would fly into a passion, and {{ask him if he}} ever expected to learn his profession, unless he applied himself closer to the study. The fact <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> retained the fondness for sport and mischief that had marked his childhood; the habit, indeed, had strengthened with his years, and gained force from being thwarted and constrained. He daily grew more and more untractable, and lost favour in the eyes both of the doctor and the housekeeper.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR BAILDON,--This {{is a real}} disappointment. It was so {{long since}} we had met, I was anxious to see where time had carried and {{stranded}} us. Last time we saw each other--it must have been all ten years ago, as we were new to the thirties--it was only for a moment, and now we're in the forties, and before very long we shall be in our graves. Sick and well, I have had a splendid life of it, grudge nothing, regret very little--and then only some little corners of misconduct for which I deserve hanging, and must infallibly be damned--and, take it all over, damnation and all, would hardly change with any man of my time, unless perhaps it were Gordon or our friend Chalmers: a man I admire for his virtues, love for his faults, and envy for the really A1 life he has, with everything heart--my heart, I mean--could wish. It is curious to think you will read this in the grey metropolis; go the first grey, east-windy day into the Caledonian Station, if it looks at all as it did of yore: I met Satan there. And then go and stand by the cross, and remember the other one--him that went down--my brother, Robert Fergusson. It is a pity you had not made me out, and seen me as patriarch and planter. I shall look forward to some record of your time with Chalmers: you can't weary me of that fellow, he {{is as big as}} a house and far bigger than any church, where no man warms his hands. Do you know anything of Thomson? Of A----, B----, C----, D----, E----, F----, at all? As I write C.'s name mustard rises in my nose; I have never forgiven that weak, amiable boy a little trick he played me when I could ill afford it: I mean that whenever I think of it, some of the old wrath kindles, not that I would hurt the poor soul, if I got the world with it. And Old X----? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> afloat? Harmless bark! I gather you ain't married yet, since your sister, to whom I ask to be remembered, goes with you. Did you see a silly tale, John Nicholson's Predicament,[15] or some such name, in which I made free with your home at Murrayfield? There is precious little sense in it, but it might amuse. Cassell's published it in a thing called Yule-Tide years ago, and nobody that ever I heard of read or has ever seen Yule-Tide. It is addressed to a class we never met--readers of Cassell's series and that class of conscientious chaff, and my tale was dull, though I don't recall that it was conscientious. Only, there's the house at Murrayfield and a dead body in it. Glad the Ballads amused you. They failed to entertain a coy public, at which I wondered; not that I set much account by my verses, which are the verses of Prosator; but I do know how to tell a yarn, and two of the yarns are great. Rahero is for its length a perfect folk-tale: savage and yet fine, full of tailforemost morality, ancient as the granite rocks; if the historian, not to say the politician, could get that yarn into his head, he would have learned some of his ABC. But the average man at home cannot understand antiquity; he is sunk over the ears in Roman civilisation; and a tale like that of Rahero falls on his ears inarticulate. The Spectator said there was no psychology in it; that interested me much: my grandmother (as I used to call that able paper, and an able paper it is, and a fair one) cannot so much as observe the existence of savage psychology when it is put before it. I am at bottom a psychologist and ashamed of it; the tale seized me one-third because of its picturesque features, two-thirds because of its astonishing psychology, and the Spectator says there's none. I am going on with a lot of island work, exulting in the knowledge of a new world, [...] "a new created world" [...] and new men; and I am sure my income will DECLINE and FALL off; for the effort of comprehension is death to the intelligent public, and sickness to the dull.|$|E
