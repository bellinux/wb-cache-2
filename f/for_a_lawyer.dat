5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his street address, Parsons asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer.</b> Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E

25|$|Income {{is one of}} a household's {{attributes}} {{most commonly}} used to determine its class status. Yet, income may not always accurately reflect a household's position within society or the economy. Unlike personal income, household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working-class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper-middle-class household, as the number of income earners has evolved {{into one of the most}} important variables in determining household income. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of $126,000 in 2006, while the median income <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> was $94,930.|$|E
25|$|When {{the detectives}} are certain {{they have the}} right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 408 {{potential}} jurors were questioned during the voir dire, which concluded on February 14. All of the 15 jurors—ten women and five men—were white, and most were under thirty years old. Five jurors had personal ties to State Troopers (one girlfriend, two nephews, and two friends). A sixteenth female juror was removed {{before the trial}} formally opened, when {{it was determined that}} Sheriff Joseph DeMarino of Middlesex County, while a private detective several years earlier, had worked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> who represented the juror's husband. Judge Appleby repeatedly denied Kunstler's requests for DeMarino to be removed from his responsibilities {{for the duration of the}} trial [...] "because he did not divulge his association with the juror." ...|$|E

During the initial questioning, Lindh was not advised of his rights and his request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> was denied.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, former President George H. W. Bush {{referred}} to Lindh as [...] "some misguided Marin County hot-tubber". The comment provoked a minor furor and prompted a retraction {{of the statement}} by Bush. Lindh's attorney [...] told the press that his client had asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> repeatedly before being interviewed by the FBI {{but he did not}} get one, and that [...] "highly coercive" [...] prison conditions forced Lindh to waive his right to remain silent. Although the FBI asked Jesselyn Radack, a Justice Department ethics advisor, whether Lindh could be questioned without a lawyer present, they did not follow her advice to avoid that scenario.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Horwood, MP for Cheltenham, Sandiford's {{most recent}} UK residence, {{expressed}} his shock at the sentence. [...] "The {{days of the}} death penalty ought to be past. This is not the way that a country that now values democracy and human rights should really be behaving." [...] The sentence was also condemned by the anti–death penalty charity Reprieve, which has taken up her case. The organisation's Harriet McCulloch said, [...] "She is clearly not a drug king pin - she has no money to pay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> for the travel costs of defence witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people." [...] Tim Hancock, Campaigns Director of Amnesty International UK also criticised the sentence. [...] "It is extremely sad to hear that judges have decided to give Lindsay Sandiford a death sentence – {{despite the fact that the}} prosecution weren't even asking for it. She is the second British citizen sentenced to death for drug offences in the last six months – an extremely worrying trend." ...|$|E
