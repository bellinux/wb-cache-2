5|$|Michálek {{was born}} in Náchod in 1968. He {{graduated}} from high school in Přerov in 1987, and from Palacký University of Olomouc in 1992. He later studied in Masaryk University's management program, and received his MPA from Nottingham Trent University's executive program in 2010. After college, he worked as a UNIX programmer, business school teacher, and portfolio manager at an investment company. Michálek was a broker at the National Property Fund from 1994 to 1996, when he was fired after exposing a tunneling embezzlement scheme. The resulting court case found that he was improperly dismissed. He was later involved in compensating victims of financial crime. Michálek served as a capital market supervisor at the Czech Ministry of Finance from 1997 to 1998, a director at the Czech Securities Commission from 1998 to 2006, a director at the Czech National Bank from 2006 to 2007, a senior consultant at the World Bank in 2007, and the chief <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> inspector at the Czech National Bank from 2008 to 2010.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the optimal <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> liberalization policy {{for a large}} country in a two-country general equilibrium production economy. In our model, household’s portfolio choice is modeled separately from firm’s investment decision and <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> {{play an important role}} in the allocation of capital between production technologies. We find that the type of production technology, specifically whether it exhibits decreasing returns to scale in capital, is an important factor in evaluating the welfare gains from <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> liberalization, and hence the optimal financial structure for a country. As <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> become liberalized, there is gain from efficient capital allocation as a result of improved sharing risk sharing. On the other hand, a less wealthy country will not be able to gain by borrowing at a lower risk-free rate and reinvesting in a more productive risky technology when <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> are completely liberalized. When production technologies exhibit decreasing returns to scale, the gain from efficient capital allocation as a result of <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> liberalization dominates the opportunity cost of higher borrowing rate for the less wealthy country. Consequently, complete <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> liberalization is more likely to be optimal when production technologies exhibit decreasing returns to capital...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} undertakes an explorative historical {{analysis of}} {{problems associated with}} crowd phenomena in the U. S. <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> between 1890 and 1940. While a study of crowd-related problems in the <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> invariably involves examinations of panics and crises, the dissertation shows that crowds were not exclusively seen as crisis phenomena, but were considered by many financial writers to be of much broader significance to the organisation and functioning of markets. The dissertation claims {{that it is necessary}} to explore the close connections between <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> and crowd phenomena in order to fully understand how markets were perceived and conceptualised in the given historical period. Inspired by Michel Foucault’s reflections on the analysis of problematisations, the dissertation explores how practical, academic and popular accounts of <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> problematised (i. e. reflected upon, contested and responded to) various crowd phenomena as they occurred in the markets. As part of the historical exposition, the dissertation examines how financial writers employed tropes and terminology from late nineteenth century crowd theories when describing and seeking to explain the processes and practices of the markets. The dissertation argues that the way in which crowd phenomena were problematised as well as the attempts to address these alleged crowd problems influenced perceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> and transformed approaches to market analysis and speculation. Drawing on an archive of handbooks on how to become a successful investor or speculator, scholarly work on <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> (from the academic fields of economics, sociology and psychology) as well as a range of popular (fictional and non-fictional) textual accounts of trading in <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> the dissertation offers a broad, yet rigorously focused, historical perspective on crowd phenomena in <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, it explores how ideas about crowd action, imitation, herding and contagion were introduced to and became integral parts of the discourses on <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> Reiterations of such historically formed ideas about crowd phenomena in <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> are still prominent in current discussions and the dissertation thus offers a historical contextualisation of a pertinent feature of contemporary debates on <b>financial</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
