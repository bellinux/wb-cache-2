40|$|Abstract: This <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>study</b> was {{conducted}} on a species (Sinapis arvensis L.) widespread in nature in Algeria particularly {{in the province of}} Tlemcen. This plant, even if it is undesirable in crop fields, can be useful in maintaining the biodiversity of the plant world. The goal set in this study was to treat the micro-propagation and germination of the species Sinapsis arvensis L. in synthetic environments, since these phenomena of growth and development in a sterile environment are poorly controlled. Our work deals successively with the following results:- The in vitro germination of Sinapis arvensisin different synthetic media, seeds taken of pods are harvested in stations in the Tlemcen region (Zenata, Beni-Ghanam and Rachgoun stations).

Field observations were combined with controlled laboratory experiments on cultivated fruit-bodies. In the field it appeared that when it is about freezing point during the day, sporulation is mainly determined by temperature factors. In milder periods, water content of the fruit-bodies is the major factor influencing the sporulation. There was not found a daily pattern in sporulation nor endogenic rhythm. In cultivated fruit-bodies, the field observations were confirmed as to the influence of relative humidity {{for the duration of the}} sporulation, but a change in humidity during the day did not influence sporulation in a uniform way. In the range of 8 — 22 °C, temperature proved to be the most important factor, always positively correlated with sporulation intensity. Pleurotus is considered as a poikilohydric organism, as its water household is mainly determined by physical laws, not hampered by special structures preventing dehydration, etc. Fruit-bodies proved to be able to tolerate rather long periods of frost or dehydration, starting sporulation again under favourable conditions.

40|$|Unfortunately, many {{traditional}} crop germplasms are being abandoned by local farmers and newly introduced varieties are used instead, without any rigorous <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>study</b> regarding their adaptive potential to local environment. In Tunisian arid regions, where salt water {{is often used}} for irrigation, a commercial chard (Perpetual spinach) variety Sais has been introduced and is currently replacing an inherited one Arbi of Medenine. In the present work, we aimed to assess the differential response of these two chard varieties (Arbi, Medenine and Sais, Italy) to two salt treatments (7 and 14 g NaCl/l). In both Arbi and Sais shoots, salinity increase led to an endogenous accumulation of sodium and proline associated with a decrease in potassium levels. The lipid peroxidation products (Malondialdehyde, MDA) accumulation in Arbi was considerably greater than in Sais, indicating {{a higher degree of}} lipid peroxidation at 14 g/l salt treatment. Salinity stimulated the superoxide dismutase (SOD, E. C. 1. 15. 1. 1), catalase (CAT, EC 1. 11. 1. 6) and guaïacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1. 11. 1. 7) activities in Arbi shoot, even under severe salt stress (14 g/l). In contrast, these antioxidant enzymes were inhibited by NaCl in Sais shoots. It could be concluded that introduced chard (Sais) exhibited better growth and displayed similar metabolite levels relative to local one (Arbi), but the local chard seems to have stronger antioxidant system that may insure better adaption to water salinity...|$|E

Here, we made an <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>study</b> coupled with comprehensive large scale proteomic analysis to examine differences of behavior in reaction to nitrogen availability changes between a wild type strain of Tisochrysis lutea (WTc 1) and a mutant strain (2 Xc 1) known to accumulate more storage lipids.

Whereas short time N repletion triggered consumption of carbohydrates in both strains, storage lipid degradation and accumulation during changes of ecophysiological status were recorded in 2 Xc 1 but not in WTc 1. After 3 months of continuous culture, 2 Xc 1 exhibited an unexpected increase of carbon sequestration ability (+ 50 %) by producing twofold more carbohydrates for the same nitrogen availability. Deep proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS identified and compared the abundance of 4332 proteins, i. e. the deepest coverage of a microalgal proteome obtained to date.

Here we investigate how {{two levels of}} turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates (? = 0. 4 and 27 cm² s ? 3) affect the PSP toxins and ecdysal cyst dynamics of two bloom forming species, Alexandrium minutum and A. catenella. The most striking responses were observed at the high ? generated by an orbital shaker. In the cultures of the two species shaken for more than 4 days, the cellular GTX(1 + 4) toxin contents were significantly lower than in the still control cultures. In A. minutum this trend was also observed in the C(1 + 2) toxin content. For the two species, inhibition of ecdysal cyst production occurred {{during the period of}} exposure of the cultures to stirring (4 or more days) at any time during their growth curve. Recovery of cyst abundances was always observed when turbulence stopped. When shaking persisted for more than 4 days, the net growth rate significantly decreased in A. minutum (from 0. 25 ± 0. 01 day ? 1 to 0. 19 ± 0. 02 day ? 1) and the final cell numbers were lower (ca. 55. 4 %) than in the still control cultures. In A. catenella, the net growth rate was not markedly modified by turbulence although under long exposure to shaking, the cultures entered earlier in the stationary phase and the final cell numbers were significantly lower (ca. 23 %) than in the control flasks. The described responses were not observed in the experiments performed at the low turbulence intensities with an orbital grid system, where the population development was favoured.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this project was to apply a range of modelling techniques to increase understanding of how irradiance affects the growth and success of toxic cyanobacteria. The modelling methodology is a multiple-model approach, using data mining, empirical, mechanistic, and Eulerian models, applied to two species of toxic cyanobacteria; Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a toxic freshwater species which is spreading worldwide, and Lyngbya majuscula, an estuarine species responsible for water quality problems in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate how {{the use of multiple}} modelling methods increases our overall understanding of processes controlling cyanobacteria populations by applying models that range from a machine learning algorithm to a theoretical partial differential equation model. In particular, a range of different models, often in conjunction with experiments, are used to further define, adding to previous research, the ecological niche of C. raciborskii, and to provide insight into the physical processes controlling benthic light and nutrients affecting L. majuscula blooms. An Eulerian model was developed {{to determine the effects of}} thermocline behaviour on light competition between a model, neutrally buoyant, filamentous cyanobacteria specie and a model, buoyant, floating colonial, cyanobacteria specie. This model provides insight into the mechanisms that promote the growth of the toxic freshwater cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, which is observed to dominate in strongly stratified systems. The model tests the hypothesis that thermocline disturbance can influence which model species succeeds under light competition. The model results suggest that neutrally buoyant species are favoured by high turbulent mixing to a constant, preferably shallow, depth. Morphological constraints mean, all else equal, that there is a trade-off between floating velocity and resource-gathering efficiency that are favoured by different turbulent mixing conditions. The key result of this study is the definition of the turbulent mixing niche of filamentous cyanobacteria in general. Machine learner models were used in conjunction with field experiments to quantify the impact of wind speed and direction on benthic irradiance and nutrients available for the growth to the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. Random forest models were constructed to predict benthic irradiance for two sites in Moreton Bay. The importance of wind speed and direction in the benthic irradiance model suggest resuspension of sediment is important in controlling benthic irradiance at both sites. In particular this helps explain the initiation of Lyngbya majuscula blooms at one of the sites: Deception Bay. The initiation period of a large bloom in Deception Bay coincided with a 5 -fold increase in benthic irradiance (100 µmol quanta m- 2 s- 1 up to 640 µmol quanta m- 2 s- 1) due to a change in wind fetch when the prevailing wind direction switched from the Southeast to the Northeast. This irradiance level matched the irradiance flux (700 µmol quanta m- 2 s- 1) found to be optimal in a published <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>study</b> of Lyngbya majuscula primary production. At one site, experiments and observations were conducted to quantify the influence of wind speed and direction on nutrient availability to L. majuscula. With a dominant controlling process identified, a simplified process model of resuspension can now be developed to predict benthic irradiance and water column nutrients. The method demonstrated the advantages of data interrogation to determine dominant processes to aid the development of parsimonious mechanistic models. The role of temperature in controlling primary production of C. raciborskii was assessed using field experiments. The primary production and irradiance (P-I) data was modelled using three techniques: empirical, mechanistic and machine learners. C. raciborskii primary production was found to increase with water temperature up to 28 oC (0. 589 +/- 0. 019 g C g chl a- 1 h- 1) after which it dropped significantly to be lowest at 32 oC (0. 108 +/- 0. 001 g C g chl a- 1 h- 1). The optimal temperature of 28 oC for C. raciborskii primary production is comparable to the optimal growth temperature for C. raciborskii recorded in literature. The results demonstrated how application of multiple models to P-I data can be used to define uncertainty in P-I parameters. The mechanistic model produced results consistent with commonly used empirical models but also produced behaviour consistent with the physiological processes on which it is based. The floating velocities of C. raciborskii trichomes (cylindrical conglomerates of cells) were quantified using a particle-tracking video microscopy method. Furthermore, the densities (977 – 989 kg m- 3) of individual trichomes were quantified using the modified Stokes law. This is the first time this inverse method density calculation has been used. The Stokes equation was also used to make predictions of the influence of changes in water temperature on the floating velocities of a range of C. raciborskii trichome sizes. As temperature increases, the rising velocities of C. raciborskii trichomes are predicted to increase by a negligible amount because the relatively small trichome size means that the floating velocity of C. raciborskii is almost negligible (< 0. 057 m/day). This thesis demonstrates that there is no preferable modelling methodology for understanding processes that control cyanobacteria populations. By choosing data appropriate modelling objectives and methodologies I was able to explore processes relevant to two cyanobacteria species more broadly than could have been possible from any one modelling methodology. Particularly, a combination of experimental data modelling and theoretical competition modelling allowed integration of the ecological niche and ecophysiology of the toxic cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. A key finding on Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is that the turbulent niche that favours it in competition for light is consistent with the aquatic environments in which it is observed to dominate (Chapter 2) ...|$|E

Body size, body mass and relative body proportions were poor indicators of endurance. Body mass was not correlated with endurance and size-free lower forelimb length had only a weak relationship with endurance. Instead, maximal metabolic rate was positively correlated with endurance capacity in varanids. A comparison of varanids with other groups of lizards supported this result as varanids showed both elevated maximal metabolic rate and elevated endurance scores when compared with similar sized non-varanid lizards. There was support for a strong association between endurance with foraging mode and climate.

(Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 275 : 47 - 61, 2002, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 68 : 3509 - 3519, 2004), who worked on three scallops harvested in 2000 in the bay of Brest (France), a well-monitored ecosystem. Lowest values of delta C- 13 (shell detrended) were recorded in all shells in late spring-early summer, most likely reflecting corresponding variations in food availability. Our results indicate that ontogenetic and seasonal variations of delta C- 13 (shell) cannot be used as a proxy for past delta C- 13 (DIC) variations but should be considered as promising tools for <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Astragalus jaegerianus, the Lane Mountain milkvetch, a {{perennial}} herbaceous legume, {{is a rare}} and very narrow endemic of the central Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County, California, and currently proposed to be listed as an endangered species. This herb grows in the protection of low shrubs. Anatomical observations revealed that leaflets are amphistomatic and have isolateral mesophyll, typical of full-sun desert leaves, and the green stem is an important photosynthetic organ, having abundant stomata and a cylinder of cortical chlore nchyma. <b>Ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> showed that this species requires high PFD (1400 - 1500 μmol m- 2 s- 1) to achieve maximum photosynthetic rates and, therefore, is probably not utilizing the nurse shrub for shade but, instead, as a trellis for upper shoots to intercept high PFD. A study of δ 15 N indicated that this legume is a nitrogen fixer, with higher tissue nitrogen content than other associated species (3. 1 % versus 1. 8 %). The herb-shrub association is speculated to be mutualistic, in that the shrub may benefit from higher soil nitrogen when it grows with a nitrogen-fixing legume, and A. jaegerianus likely uses the nurse shrub for protection from herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Horticultural crops {{include a}} wide range of commodities, such as fruits and {{vegetables}} that are highly valuable for humanity. They are extensively grown worldwide, and their production can be described as an open and highly complex system affected by many factors, among which we can count weather, soil and cropping system, as well as the interaction between these factors. The aim of environmental physiology is to characterize the interaction between environmental stress and crop response, in order to maximize both yield quantity and quality. This review presents the most recent findings about the effects of the main abiotic environmental factors (light, temperature, and water) on whole plant physiology of horticultural crops. Environmental stresses can cause morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes in crops, resulting in a strong profit reduction. A clear understanding of environmental factors and their interaction with physiological processes is extremely important for improving horticultural practices (irrigation, light management, mineral nutrition, greenhouse design, etc.), optimizing photosynthetic carbon assimilation and increasing fruit productivity and crop quality. In addition, the information obtained by <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> can be incorporated into breeding programs or agricultural zoning strategies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Chlorophyll a {{fluorescence}} is a {{very useful}} tool in <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> to analyze the photosynthetic performance of plants under biotic and abiotic stresses. This research aimed to evaluate {{the parameters of the}} fluorescence of chlorophyll a, contents of chlorophyll a, b and total, and carotenoids in Atriplex nummularia cultivated under water stress (37 and 70 % of field capacity) and salt stress (irrigation water with electrical conductivity of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 dS m- 1), besides two sources of salts: NaCl and a mixture of salts of Ca 2 +, Mg+ 2, K+, Na+ and Cl-, in a 6 x 2 x 2 factorial, with 4 replicates, totaling 96 experimental plots. At 91 days after transplanting, the initial fluorescence (F 0), maximum fluorescence (Fm), potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), Fv/F 0 ratio and the contents of chlorophyll a, b, and total and carotenoids were determined. All assessed parameters decreased as a standard response to salt stress, except F 0, which had, as a characteristic, the increase in its values under stress conditions. The emission parameters for Atriplex nummularia varied with the type of salt present in the irrigation water...|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} fraction of Ophrys sphegodes Mill. subsp. sphegodes, Ophrys bertolonii subsp. benacensis (Reisigl) O. Danesch, E. Danasch & Ehrend. and Neotinea tridentata (Scop.) R. M. Bateman, Pridgeon & M. W. Case, three orchid species with different pollinator attraction strategies, sampled in vivo and in situ, {{were evaluated by}} headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results were compared with the volatile compounds emitted by flowering plant samples picked from the same populations of orchid species. Hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols and terpenes were the major constituents of “in vivo” orchid scents and some distinctive differences in volatile metabolite composition were observed between Ophrys and Neotinea species. Moreover, the odour bouquets of the picked flowering plant samples were different from the in vivo ones and in particular different proportions of the various terpenes and an increase of α-pinene were observed. In conclusion HS/SPME GCMS {{proved to be a}} suitable technique for analyzing and distinguishing the volatile fingerprint of different orchid species, sampled in vivo and in situ in a non-disruptive way, with potentially great advantages for <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> of rare and endangered species...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an eclectic}} review and {{analysis}} of contemporary and promising stable isotope methodologies to study the biology and ecology of arthropods. It is augmented with literature from other disciplines, indicative {{of the potential for}} knowledge transfer. It is demonstrated that stable isotopes can be used to understand fundamental processes in the biology and ecology of arthropods, which range from nutrition and resource allocation to dispersal, food-web structure, predation, etc. It is concluded that falling costs and reduced complexity of isotope analysis, besides the emergence of new analytical methods, are likely to improve access to isotope technology for arthropod studies still further. Stable isotopes pose no environmental threat and do not change the chemistry or biology of the target organism or system. These therefore represent ideal tracers for field and <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies,</b> thereby avoiding reductionist experimentation and encouraging more holistic approaches. Considering (i) the ease with which insects and other arthropods can be marked, (ii) minimal impact of the label on their behaviour, physiology, and ecology, and (iii) environmental safety, we advocate more widespread application of stable isotope technology in arthropod studies and present a variety of potential uses...|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian "campo rupestre" {{vegetation}} shows high light heterogeneity, characteristic {{which is}} often disregarded in <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> due the difficult of obtaining accurate measurements in a complex environment. The aim {{of the present study}} it was to describe how much heterogeneous is the light distribution in this environment, as well as tried to define classes in relation to the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for 30 rupicolous individuals of Bulbophyllum involutum. The individuals were marked and previously classified in light classes visually predetermined ("full sun", "partially shaded" and "shaded"). Once defined these classes, principal component analysis, cluster and dispersal analyses using direct and indirect PAR measures were performed to characterize the environment as well as to validate the inclusion of the individuals in each class. The use of multivariate analysis increased the accuracy of predetermined classes of light, and some individuals from "shaded" and "partially shaded" classes needed to be regrouped. After individuals' reclassification, amplitude of PAR variance was reduced in each class, enhancing homogeneity. Ours results show the possibility to evaluate light environment conditions more precisely in "campo rupestre" vegetation using multivariate analysis, allowing the increase in accuracy of this parameter for ecophysiological researches...|$|R
40|$|Saxitoxins (STXs) are {{carbamate}} alkaloid neurotoxins {{produced by}} marine “red tide” dinoflagellates and {{several species of}} freshwater filamentous cyanobacteria, including Anabaena circinalis, Aphanizomenon spp., Lyngbya wollei, and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. A specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) method based on SYBR green chemistry was developed to quantify saxitoxin-producing Anabaena circinalis cyanobacteria, which are major bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacteria. The {{aim of this study}} was to infer the potential toxigenicity of samples by determining the copy number of a unique and unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) sequence (sxtA) in the STX biosynthesis gene cluster identified in cyanobacteria. Our qPCR approach was applied to water samples collected from different Australian lakes, dams, and rivers. The STX concentration and cyanobacterial cell density of these blooms were also determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microscopic cell counting, respectively. STX concentrations correlated positively with STX gene copy numbers, indicating that the latter can be used as a measure of potential toxigenicity in Anabaena circinalis and possibly other cyanobacterial blooms. The qPCR method targeting STX genes can also be employed for both monitoring and <b>ecophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> of toxic Anabaena circinalis blooms and potentially several other STX-producing cyanobacteria...|$|R
