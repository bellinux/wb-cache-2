Then a part of the Force Publique went to Egypt and British Mandatory Palestine and was redesignated the 1st Belgian Congo Brigade Group during 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood their <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, they {{eventually}} broke and {{fled to the}} palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E

The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> return to higher national office. Bo {{made no secret of}} his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|In early August, three North Korean {{divisions}} mounted offensives {{against the}} three {{passes through the}} area, with the NK 8th Division attacking Yongch'on, NK 12th Division attacking P’ohang-dong and NK 5th Division, {{in conjunction with the}} 766th Independent Infantry Regiment, attacking An'gang-ni. The NK 8th Division drove for Yongch'on from Uiseong, but its attack failed to reach the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being surprised and outflanked by the ROK 8th Division. This fighting was so heavy that the NK 8th Division was forced to hold its <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week before trying to advance. Stalled again by South Korean resistance, it halted to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performances during the game, North Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team, and Virginia Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen was named the most valuable player of the losing team. Keldorf finished the game having completed 12 of his 28 pass attempts for 290 yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Sorensen completed four of eight passes for 24 yards and carried the ball 10 times on the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of 19 yards. Al Clark, the quarterback whom Sorensen replaced, finished the game having completed nine of 17 pass attempts for 66 yards.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Frenchman’s Creek {{took place}} during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States {{in the early hours of}} November 28, 1812, in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada, near the Niagara River. The {{operation}} was conceived as a raid to prepare the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of their points of attack. They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, “the Battle of Frenchman’s Creek” by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, “the Affair opposite Black Rock”.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} {{which have}} adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is a breeding <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E

5|$|While {{covering}} another convoy to Malta on 12October, she {{was damaged}} by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system {{was not immediately}} apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing <b>Ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines. On 28October, Eagle {{and the rest of}} the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into bus rapid transit, {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> future bus rapid transit line.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs {{must be able to}} move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> longer period on take-off. The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.|$|E
