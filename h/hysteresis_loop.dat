40|$|International audiencePreisach {{quasi-static}} hysteresis {{model is}} highly {{used in the}} electromagnetic simulation community. To run hysteresis Preisach model, one firstly needs to describe the Preisach triangular distribution followed by experimental results (<b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops).</b> Unfortunately, nondestructive technique control (NDT) situations forbid access to such experimental <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops.</b> In this article, a new technique based on magnetic Barkhausen noise measurement is proposed to describe Preisach distribution.

40|$|The {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) model proposed by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams is applied to develop a functional approximation of material data {{in the form of}} <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> from a nickel-base superalloy, Hastelloy X. Several different ANN configurations are used to model <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> at different cycles for this alloy. The ANN models were successful in reproducing the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> used for its training. However, because of sharp bends at the two ends of <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops,</b> a drift occurs at the corners of the loops where loading changes to unloading and vice versa (the sharp bends occurred when the stress-strain curves were reproduced by adding stress increments to the preceding values of the stresses). Therefore, it is possible only to reproduce half of the loading path. The generalization capability of the network was tested by using additional data for two other <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> at different cycles. The results were in good agreement. Also, the use of ANN led to a data compression ratio of approximately 22 : 1...|$|R

As the flow speed increases (Reynolds number, Re) the frequency slowly climbs (nearly constant Strouhal number, St) but then the frequency jumps up abruptly to a higher stage.

The ferromagnetic coupling between the CrO 2 cores and Cr 2 O 3 shell is responsible for exchange bias observed below 292 K. In the temperature range of 261 K-similar to 340 K, the particles show inverted <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops,</b> i. e., the negative remanence and coercivity.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field E is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be reversed by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent {{not only on the}} current electric field but also on its history, yielding a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop.</b> [...] They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to ferromagnetic materials, which have spontaneous magnetization and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.|$|E
2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond force constant, ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are going to affect the vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, is going to cause a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
