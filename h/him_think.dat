25|$|Well, {{the racism}} wasn't there, the {{homophobia}} wasn't there—as much. Even the drug use {{was a little}} more tolerated. But really I think that Booker felt he was being taken seriously in Europe, and it made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of himself differently and improved the quality of his music. He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.|$|E
25|$|Chiron then {{travels to}} Miami and reunites with Kevin, {{who now works}} at a diner.

25|$|In November 1571, Lesley {{testified that}} he had spoken with Norfolk in a gallery at York, after conferring with Lethington, and Norfolk was {{convinced}} that the publication of the letters would dishonour Mary forever. When Norfolk was questioned about the conversations at York, he said that Lethington had told him he was working for Mary. Lethington, said Norfolk, began to make <b>him</b> <b>think</b> Mary was innocent and planted the idea that he should marry her. Nevertheless, Norfolk was executed for treason in 1572.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> very differently.|$|E

He tricks his father with a forged letter, making <b>him</b> <b>think</b> that Edgar plans to usurp the estate. Kent returns from exile in disguise (calling himself Caius), and Lear hires him as a servant. At Albany and Goneril's house, Lear and Kent quarrel with Oswald, Goneril's steward. Lear discovers that now that Goneril has power, she no longer respects him. She orders him {{to reduce the number}} of his disorderly retinue. Enraged, Lear departs for Regan's home.

25|$|An Anglican {{priest of}} Irish extraction, {{he was born}} on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1777. He was a bright young man and after being taught by the Rev. Thomas Tighe, he won a {{scholarship}} to St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity and ancient and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> his name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Brontë, perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson who held the title of Duke of Bronte, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the United Irishmen {{and he wanted to}} distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.|$|E
25|$|Fai's {{real name}} is , and {{he was born with}} his {{identical}} twin brother, Fai, in Valeria Country. The birth of twins in the country was a bad omen, which led to many misfortunes upon the country. The king imprisoned them within a tower, just before he killed everybody in the country. Eventually, Fei-Wang Reed appeared and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yūi, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death, though Fei-Wang tampered with Yūi's memory to make <b>him</b> <b>think</b> that he chose his own life over Fai. Promising to return Fai to life if Yūi becomes his pawn, Fei-Wang bestowed two curses upon him. The curses are to kill whoever is a stronger magician than he is, and another curse will use his magic to collapse the world around them. He was soon found by Ashura-ō, who took in Yūi, having adopted the name Fai. Ashura conforted Fai, and gave him his tattoo to suppress the first curse. Fai eventually learned that Ashura's purpose was to be killed by Fai's first curse, as Ashura killed people in order to make his magic stronger.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E

500|$|The {{demo version}} of [...] "Live Forever" [...] {{begins with an}} {{acoustic}} guitar intro. While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro {{and replaced it with}} a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to [...] "not cut it in half again on the final mix". [...] Morris said that the removed part made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of [...] "Slash in leather keks with a wind machine on the Grand Canyon".|$|E
500|$|The Pomegranates second review {{came from}} Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the University of Tasmania, who praises Greenwood's research, {{theoretical}} approach {{and style of}} writing. He notes that her [...] "truly ground breaking" [...] approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had [...] "fascinated and thrilled" [...] him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection Being Changed by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld was [...] "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> about these issues [...] "in much sharper focus." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping <b>him</b> <b>think</b> better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come".|$|E

500|$|Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post {{said that}} [...] "Everything about this premiere worked". He {{felt that the}} show was a cross between Fringe and Heroes with {{elements}} of The X-Files included. He {{thought that there was}} a potential for the series to be a success and thought that it would attract both Marvel fans and new viewers alike. Dave Bradley gave the episode four and a half out of five for SFX magazine, saying that the show was going to become a phenomenon alongside Doctor Who, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. He felt that using the Skye character to introduce the viewer to the series was cheesy, but effective. He praised J August Richards' performance but did not enjoy some of the characterizations of the main characters, which made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> the team was similar to that seen in Torchwood.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky was {{inspired}} to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged not just to Russia but to the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him {{to become the first}} Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, Warrack writes, {{as well as those of}} other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: [...] "Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf had {{announced}} that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would {{say things that}} made <b>him</b> <b>think</b> he {{was sitting next to}} Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's much more of a rock album." [...] Child says {{that one of the most}} memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on [...] "Bad for Good". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.|$|E
