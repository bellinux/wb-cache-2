500|$|According to Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams in [...] "What Do You Think? The X-Files, Liminality, and Gender Pleasure", [...] "Humbug" [...] {{is about}} [...] "difference, sex, and looking". Regarding The X-Files as a whole, {{they say that}} the {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully is non-sexual and [...] "quasi-marital". Although sharing a degree of intimacy that allows them to share each other's space, they avoid a sexual or objectifying gaze: [...] "They look into each other's eyes and argue ideas, rather than gazing at each other's bodies." [...] This status quo is challenged in this episode as the objectifying gaze is highlighted and deconstructed, although not between the partners themselves. According to Wilcox and Williams, a key scene involves Agent Scully and Lanny. When Lanny goes to wake Scully in her trailer one morning, he catches a glimpse of her breasts; she inadvertently exposes <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> in turn catches sight of Lanny's uncovered parasitic twin; [...] "each gaze involves the objectification of difference". This objectification is emphasized by the fact that Scully's body is not normally revealed in this way.|$|E

Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E
