40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{monetary and}} scal policy responses to oil price shocks in low income oil importing countries. I examine the dynamic properties and the welfare {{implications of a}} set of ination targeting policies and a group of policies where the government provides a subsidy on household purchases of oil products and nances this subsidy through some combination of printing money and raising non-distortionary lump sum taxes. Even in the case where lump sum taxes nance the subsidy, it distorts household behavior in important ways leading to over consumption of oil products, increased trade decits, and distortions to the labor supply. Resorting to the ination tax to nance the subsidy leads to signicant macroeconomic issues when exchange rates are exible. The welfare gains from a policy that nances the subsidy through lump sum taxation are small compared to the policy with <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> through. For most calibrations the losses from nancing the policy through the ination tax are substantial. The welfare generated by the ination targeting policies is close to the baseline policy with <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> through so long as the response to ination is strong enough. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the practical use of Taylor-type rules in Trinidad and Tobago, {{which is in}} the process of implementing market based monetary policy and seeks to implement flexible inflation targeting in the presence of a managed exchange rate. This is motivated by the idea that normative Taylor rules can be shaped by the practical experience of developing countries. We find that the inflation – exchange rate nexus is strong, hence the country may be unwilling to allow the exchange rate to float freely. We contend that despite weak market development the Taylor rule can still be applied as the central bank is able to use moral suasion to achieve <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> through of the policy rate to the market rate. Our evidence rejects Galí and Monacelli’s (2005) argument that the optimal monetary policy rule for the open economy is isomorphic for a closed economy. Rather, our evidence suggests that the rule for the open economy allows for lower variability when the rule is augmented by the real exchange rate as in Taylor (2001). We also reject Galí and Monacelli’s (2005) hypothesis that domestic inflation is optimal for inclusion in the Taylor-type rule. Instead we find that core CPI inflation leads to lower variability. Additionally, our evidence suggests that the monetary rule, when applied to Trinidad and Tobago, is accommodating to the US Federal Reserve rate. Further, we expand the work of Martin and Milas (2010) which considered the pass through of the policy rate to the interbank rate in the presence of risk and liquidity. By extending the transmission to the market lending rate, we are able to go beyond those disruptive factors by considering excess liquidity and spillovers of international economic disturbances. We found that these shocks are significant for Trinidad and Tobago, but it is not significant enough to disrupt the pass through.

40|$|We seek to {{evaluate}} {{the extent of the}} pass through of increased fuel and carbon costs to wholesale prices with a shift of generation from coal-fired to gas-fired plants. Modelling of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s National Electricity Market in 2035 is undertaken using Australian Energy Market Operator assumptions for fuel costs, capital costs and demand forecasts. An electricity market simulation package (PLEXOS), which uses deterministic linear programming techniques and transmission and generating plant data, is used to optimize the power system and determine the least cost dispatch of generating resources to meet a given demand. We find that wholesale market prices increase due to the <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> through of the increased costs of gas over coal as an input fuel and the Carbon Price. In addition, we find that wholesale prices increase by more than the pass through of fuel and carbon costs {{because of the fact that}} generators can charge infra-marginal rents and engage in strategic behaviour to maximize their profits.

30|$|In principle, several {{scenarios}} {{concerning the}} pass-through of acquisition costs and opportunity costs of freely allocated allowances can be considered. In case a partial or <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> through occurs, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that a demand reaction will follow, depending on the extent of the price increase and the price elasticity of demand. In the model presented herein, we assume no change in passenger demand or airline supply in reaction to the EU-ETS. This is due to the fact that reliable data on the price elasticity of demand for air travel does not exist for this issue. This implies the assumption that none of the costs for the EU-ETS will be passed through to passengers and shippers of air cargo. Furthermore, our forecasting model increases frequencies on existing routes, but does not take into account potential impacts of the EU-ETS on airline strategies concerning aircraft size, frequencies or the discontinuation of existing routes. As the results of our model presented in this paper are focused on the assessment of cost impacts for the airline industry in the rather short-term until 2012, we are not predicting long-term changes in market, fleet or network structures.|$|E
30|$|Since 1985, the 50 -ha census {{proceeded}} identically, always {{starting in}} the southwest and proceeding east, and always finishing in 10 – 11 months. As a result, the census interval for individuals never differed much from 5 years. But a much longer census was unavoidable in 1982 when all trees were tagged. One <b>full</b> <b>pass</b> lasted from March, 1981, until August, 1982, then, since a 50 -ha census was much larger than any prior and we were concerned about missing trees, a second pass was done between August, 1982, and March, 1983. A few new individuals were added (< 5 % of the total). This meant the 1982 – 1985 time interval for individual trees was as little as 2.5 years {{and as long as}} 4 years. It was unfortunate that the unusual drought of 1983 fell during this first census interval, but that could not be planned. We have carefully examined notes from the first census to be certain that we have the date on which each tree was observed alive and measured, and all growth rates and death rates are calculated from individual census dates.|$|E
