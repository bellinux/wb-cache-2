Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million.

5|$|The {{hooded crow}} breeds in {{northern}} and <b>eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western Asia. Where its range overlaps with carrion crow, as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, {{and this is}} one of the reasons this species was split from the carrion crow. Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such as Iran and central Russia.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II.
