5|$|Marsh Tackies {{have the}} same ancestral bloodlines as Florida Cracker Horses and North Carolina Banker horses. However, DNA testing <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> that the Marsh Tackies' {{relative}} isolation has made them a separate breed with unique characteristics.|$|E
5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee {{was of the}} view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> effective for the same purpose.|$|E
30|$|Thus we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> Theorem 1.|$|R

30|$|We <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> the {{following}} assertion.|$|R
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} being undertaken include international cooperation, legal protection, research, monitoring, habitat management, {{education and}} the maintenance of captive flocks for propagation and reintroduction. Although the bird breeds well in the wild, it <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> much more problematic to get it to breed while in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} date Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle to {{the early}} 14th century, although recent archaeological evidence <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> human existence in the area back to the 12th or 13th century. Initially built to protect the bridge connecting the city with the mainland, the castle sits {{on top of a}} peninsula carved out by the winding Smotrych River, forming a natural defense system for Kamianets-Podilskyi's historic Old Town neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} by historians that 168, 170 and 172 Denmark Hill {{were designed by}} noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their similarity in architectural style to his other buildings. However, as the original documentation relating {{to the construction of}} these houses has been lost or destroyed, it <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> impossible to confirm this.|$|E
30|$|Hence, we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> Theorem  1.6.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the riding, {{candidates}} have a tougher time running a campaign in Calgary Buffalo, as traditional campaign methods <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> relatively ineffective — i.e., placement of lawn signs, door knocking, and voter identification <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> to be of limited usefulness.|$|R
50|$|Specialized plasma heat torches {{can be used}} in {{construction}} to heat up soil, a technique that <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be useful for providing more solid footing for buildings and structures. This is still a developing technology, but <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> to be successful in prototype testing.|$|R
5|$|Press Gang <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be {{a series}} that can {{transport}} {{you back to}} how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
5|$|Saproamanita thiersii inhabits lawns, {{pastures}} and prairies throughout the Mississippi River Basin. It often forms fairy rings or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. It {{has been found}} growing in the same lawn as Chlorophyllum molybdites. Analysis using stable carbon isotopes <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> that this mushroom is saprotrophic in nature, unlike the other mycorrhizal Amanitas.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to occur {{as a result of}} some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> definitive. While {{there are a number of}} environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E
30|$|Thus we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> the {{following}} theorem.|$|R
30|$|Thus, we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> the {{following}} inequality.|$|R
30|$|We <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> that (2.15) is valid.|$|R
5|$|The {{exhibition}} at Kirkleatham <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> extremely popular; by October 2011 {{it had already}} attracted more than 28,000 visitors in only four months. In April 2012 the {{exhibition at}}tracted further praise when the museum won the prestigious Renaissance Museum title at the annual Journal and Arts Council Awards.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled. The taxonomy <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> very complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group. This {{is due to a}} number of factors, including the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridisation occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation.|$|E
5|$|The series <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> {{extremely}} popular around the world, both commercially and critically. In Japan, the manga sold over 16 million copies; over 1 million anime DVDs were also sold. The English {{release of the}} manga has been reprinted many times. Both anime and manga have received numerous industry awards in Japan and North America, as well as praise from critics.|$|E
5000|$|Mining / power generation. Due to rugged {{design and}} the ability to {{continuously}} move material in low-headroom situations, belt feeders <b>have</b> <b>proven</b> ideal for handling materials like coal and ore. This gentle and economical transportation <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> vital for both the mining and power generation industries.|$|R
30|$|Thus, we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> {{the double}} {{inequality}} (7).|$|R
30|$|To sum up, we <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> the following.|$|R
5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|As of 30 September 2017, a {{total of}} 7,771 Airbus A320-family {{aircraft}} have been delivered, of which 7,434 are in service. In addition, another 5,520 airliners are on firm order. It ranked as the world's fastest-selling jet airliner family according to records from 2005 to 2007, and as the best-selling single-generation aircraft programme. The A320 family <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> popular with airlines including low-cost carriers such as EasyJet, which purchased A319s and A320s to replace its 737 fleet. As of 30 September 2017, American Airlines was the largest operator of the Airbus A320 family aircraft, operating 394 aircraft. The aircraft family competes directly with the 737 and has competed with the 717, 757, and the MD-80/MD-90.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, PepsiCo {{spun off}} its {{restaurants}} division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which {{changed its name}} to Yum! Brands in 2002. Yum <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> a more focused owner than Pepsi, and although KFC's number of outlets have declined in the US, the company has continued to grow in Asia, South America and Africa. The chain has expanded to 18,875 outlets across 118 countries and territories, with 4,563 outlets in China alone, KFC's largest market.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, KFC International {{launched}} the Krusher (Krushem in some markets) line of frozen beverages. The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be a success for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013. In September 2012, the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the role}} of Metrovías was lessened to simply {{operating}} the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrovías became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrovías' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving {{the door open for}} a state-run or mixed operation. Among the public, privatisation <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.|$|E

60|$|But to proceed. The {{next thing}} to be asked is, Were the promised {{pensions}} given to the jaghiredars? I suppose your Lordships are not idle enough to put that question to us. No compensation, no consideration, was given or stipulated for them. If there had been any such thing, the prisoner could <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> it,--he would <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> it.
