500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode [...] "milked" [...] the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following {{there would be a lot}} of [...] "tense moments" [...] between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so [...] "it would be hard to split them up". After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she [...] "feels secure". Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the [...] "shame" [...] and she doesn't want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> she has failed.

500|$|The {{score for}} Secret of Mana was {{composed}} by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project. He {{was replaced with}} Kikuta when Ito was forced to drop Secret of Mana due to other demands on his time, such as the soundtrack to Romancing SaGa. It was Kikuta's first video game score. Encountering difficulties {{in dealing with the}} hardware limitations of the SNES, Kikuta tried to express in the music two [...] "contrasting styles" [...] to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, [...] "immersive" [...] and [...] "three-dimensional". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the SNES. These custom samples allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so {{he did not have to}} worry about differences between the original composition and the SNES. Kikuta said in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation.|$|E

Masaya knows Mew Ichigo's real identity, but initially pretends otherwise as he knows Ichigo {{does not want}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Ichigo describes Masaya as [...] "smart", [...] "cute", [...] "very athletic" [...] and [...] "popular at school". He is also depicted as being a polite and calm person, though he does have moments when he yells at others in anger and acts jealous and possessive regarding Ichigo. Towards {{the end of the}} series, Masaya reveals that as an orphan, he began acting like a [...] "perfect child" [...] to be adopted, in reality, however, he felt sick of humans and disgusted by how they treat the planet. He also reveals that Ichigo is the sole exception, and it was only with her that he felt like a [...] "real human being". As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaya is the Blue Knight, but that Masaya did not know that he was the Blue Knight, nor did the Blue Knight appear to have any knowledge that he was Masaya.

Shortly after this revelation, Masaya collapses and reawakens as Deep Blue, the leader of the aliens and the Mew Mew's final enemy. Deep Blue claims that he created Masaya in order to deceive the world until the time was right for his awakening. Masaya sacrifices himself by releasing the final Mew Aqua inside his body in order to stop Deep Blue, and is revived when Ichigo gives her life to save him. In turn, the mew aqua remaining his body then saves her. At the end of the series, Masaya decides to go to England to study the endangered species used for the Mew Project and the Mew Mews hold a mock wedding for Masaya and Ichigo before he leaves. In Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Masaya is the first to sense the new danger to the Mew Mews, and encourages Ichigo to return to help her friends. Towards the end of a la Mode, he also returns to Tokyo.|$|E

[...] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort [...] "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew.

On his part, Iglesias accused the PSOE of seeking a minority government and Podemos' obedience to it, demanding that Sánchez meet <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the PSOE wanted to negotiate.
