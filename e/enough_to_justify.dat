5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not. Only {{a minority of the}} world's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.|$|E
5|$|Sales of the {{hardcover}} publication were significant <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> two additional reprints {{of the book}} within the first year, and the novel was recognized with a Hugo Award by science fiction and fantasy fans as the best science fiction novel of 1960.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the European Parliament defined {{lands that}} were ineligible for {{producing}} biofuel feedstocks {{for the purpose}} of the Directives.

5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount. The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton Line service has run through Readville without making a station stop, {{even though there are}} platforms in place to allow such use.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> development of a more robust version.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Guillermo's track, {{the storm}} never {{threatened}} any major landmass, resulting in {{little impact on}} land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean, affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> retirement of its name.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, ODST {{became the}} top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Reviewers were divided {{on whether the}} relatively short campaign and included extras were <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the game's US$60 price tag. The game was the top-selling title in the United States in September 2009, and sold more than 3million copies worldwide. Softpedia, Time, and Wired were among publications that declared the game one of the year's best.|$|E
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E

5|$|The Santa Fe {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first dome car, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the 2009–10 season, Booth {{sustained}} a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another concern was the timing of Richards' hit, as Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> a suspension.|$|E

The game bore the Zaxxon brand only in the United States, as the Japanese version was named Parasquad and the European version was named Motherbase. U.S. gaming critics generally remarked that the game was not similar <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> Zaxxon <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> {{the use of the}} brand.|$|R
