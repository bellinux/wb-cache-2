5|$|Adamle {{attended}} Ohio State University {{and was on}} the 1942 Ohio State Buckeyes freshman team, {{but left}} school prior to the 1943 season to fight in World War II. After serving in the U.S. Air Force in the Mediterranean Theatre of War, he returned to Ohio State for the team's 1946 season—his only season with the varsity Buckeyes. Playing as a center in a November game against the Northwestern Wildcats, Adamle intercepted a Frank Aschenbrenner pass in the third quarter and returned it 38 yards. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> interception {{in the fourth quarter of}} the 39–27 Buckeyes victory. Ohio State finished the season with a 4–3–2 record and Adamle was selected to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country.|$|E

5|$|After making five {{appearances}} for Farnborough, he rejoined Stevenage on non-contract terms, after {{training with}} Grimsby Town. He made two appearances for Stevenage, and {{after failing to}} earn a long-term contract <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> trial at Grimsby. He eventually joined St Albans City in February, where he made one appearance before signing for Hemel Hempstead Town in March. After making two appearances, he soon moved on after joining Isthmian League Premier Division club Hampton & Richmond Borough 10 days later. He made six appearances for Hampton {{before the end of}} the 2004–05 season. He joined Worthing after a trial in July 2005, and was loaned to Thurrock of the Conference South in February 2006, where he made four appearances after making his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Yeading. Before this loan, he was transfer-listed by Worthing, and in March he was released by the club, after scoring 17 goals in 30 appearances during the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Although his Test {{career had}} finished, Loxton {{continued}} to play for his state. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> disappointing season with the bat in 1951–52, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71—his only fifty of the season—and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton’s unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them to hold on for a draw with one wicket intact. He continued to take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, {{who went on to}} win the competition.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he could}} appear in any games with Colorado Springs, López was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 14. Due to major league rules, Arizona {{was unable to}} call him up until April 24. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> poor season, having a record of 1–1 and an 11.02 ERA, {{the highest in the}} majors among {{relievers}} who made at least 30 appearances. On July 5, López was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Armando Almanza. He cleared waivers and was sent down to the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League {{for the rest of the}} season. He went 0–1 with a 2.22 ERA. On October 15, he was granted free agency.|$|E

5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Sakic only {{played in}} 65 games {{due to a}} lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first Presidents' Trophy and third {{straight}} division title. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche {{all the way to}} the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer sheet with the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{made his}} third {{appearance}} at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight {{gold medal at the}} tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> opportunity to step in for the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled himself out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3–2 win.|$|E

5|$|Meckiff {{was hoping}} to regain his Test place, and started his 1962–63 {{campaign}} in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. After Victoria made 174, the paceman took 4/65 to dismiss South Australia for 141 in the first innings. In the second innings he took 3/76 to help seal a win. He continued his early season form in taking match figures of 7/179 against Western Australia, {{but was unable to}} prevent defeat. Despite these performances, Meckiff was overlooked for the First Test. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> chance to vie for national selection when Victoria played England after the opening Test, and took match figures of 4/90 as the tourists completed a five-wicket victory. He dismissed Ray Illingworth, Geoff Pullar and Alan Smith as Victoria took a four-run first innings lead, but the hosts collapsed in their second innings and Dexter's men reached their target of 180 with five wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1950–51 season with an unbeaten 201 in a Shield match against Queensland. At 438minutes, {{it was his}} longest {{first-class}} innings. In the return match, he scored 138notout in just 118minutes in a successful run-chase, a sharp contrast to his double-century. In a tour match against the visiting England team at the SCG before the Test series, Miller scored 214, having been 99notout at stumps on the previous day. He hit 15 fours and three sixes. However, he made ducks in consecutive matches leading into the First Test in Brisbane. Miller scored 15 and eight on a rain-affected pitch, and took match figures of 3/50 in an Australian victory, dismissing Dewes twice. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> quiet match in the Second Test, scoring 18 and 14 and taking a match total of 2/55. After struggling {{in the first two}} Tests, Miller rediscovered his batting form with 98 against the tourists for New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The 1913–14 {{domestic}} {{season was}} to be the last season of cricket before the outbreak of World War I. Macartney captained New South Wales for the first time against Tasmania. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> prolific season with the bat; in six matches he scored 892 runs at 111.50 in nine innings. He scored 201 in an innings victory over Victoria, four other centuries including a 195, and two fifties. With Macartney in such form, five of the matches were won by an innings, and another by nine wickets. The record was blotted only by a loss to South Australia by 19 runs. Macartney took two wickets at 32.50. Macartney was selected for the five-Test tour of South Africa in 1914–15, but the campaign was called off due to the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit {{in a more}} moderate manner than Moreno.

5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E
5|$|While training, Miller flew Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{near death}} experience: {{mechanical}} problems {{forced him to}} make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred. On another occasion, Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of the patrons. In October, he went AWL to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team. At {{the end of his}} officer training, Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces. During a mission to Belgium, the vessel fought a German U-boat, which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{came back}} for another PBL season with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2011. The team had changed {{locations}} from Manchester, New Hampshire to Saint John, New Brunswick in Canada {{prior to the start}} of the season. Anderson debuted on January 2, 2011in a loss against the Quebec Kebs, in which he recorded a team-high 20 points, 6 assists, and 4 steals. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> notable scoring performance on January 21, when he poured 24 points on the Rochester RazorSharks. In the next two contests, Anderson recorded season-highs of 9 assists and 7 rebounds vs. the Halifax Rainmen and tied his season-bests of 24 points and 9 assists in a rematch against the Quebec Kebs. The three games led to him being named PBL Player of the Week on February 10, 2011. On March 17, Anderson scored a season-high 32 points with 12-of-24 shooting and 5 three-pointers vs. the Halifax Rainmen. He also contributed 6 assists and 4 rebounds. As the season came to a conclusion, he was named second-team All-PBL.|$|E
5|$|Following his success, Headley {{abandoned}} his prospective career in dentistry. Although some critics expected his selection for the West Indies tour of England in 1928, Headley was not chosen. While West Indies played their inaugural Test series during that tour, Headley {{continued to play}} for St Catherine's. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> opportunity against English opposition in 1929, when {{a team led by}} Julien Cahn arrived to play two first-class games. Jamaica's distance from other Caribbean islands made it difficult for their cricketers to gain good-quality playing experience, so the frequent visits by English sides were important to the development of Jamaican cricket. These tours also served to build Headley's reputation. In the first match, Headley played a slow, defensive innings of 57, but he did not reach fifty in his other three innings. Even so, he was chosen by the Jamaican selectors for a West Indies XI, which included players from other islands, to play Cahn's team in their final tour match. The home side lost the toss and had to bat in very difficult conditions following rain. Headley found the fast bowlers difficult, but survived the period when the pitch was most difficult to bat on before he was out for 44. In the second innings, he attacked from the start and used a wide range of shots to reach 143 before he was run out. In three matches against the tourists, Headley scored 326 runs, averaging 54.33.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's supporter, Adolf von Neuenahr, {{surrounded}} Neuss in March 1586, {{and persuaded}} Ernst's small garrison to capitulate. He refortified and restocked {{the city and}} placed young Friedrich Cloedt in command of a garrison of 1600men, mostly Germans and Dutch soldiers. The town's fortifications were substantial; 100years earlier it had resisted a lengthy siege by Charles the Bold (1433–1477) of Burgundy, and between the fortifications, the natural defenses of rivers, and the garrison, it could withstand {{all but the most}} determined assaults. In July 1586, the Duke of Parma approached and surrounded the city; by some irony, Agnes' cousin, Karl von Mansfeld and his troops were a part of the Spanish force assembled against Neuss. Parma had an impressive force at his command; in addition to Mansfeld's 2000troops, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> 6000or so foot and Tercios, 2000well-mounted, experienced Italian, Spanish and German soldiers, and some 45cannons, which he distributed on the redoubt across the river and on the heights a short distance from the city walls. According to the protocols of war generally accepted in 1586, Parma requested the capitulation of the city prior to the cannonade. Cloedt declined to capitulate, politely. The next day, being the feast of St. James, and the patron day for the Spanish, the bombardment was not initiated, although mendacious reports circulated in the Spanish camp that the Protestants had roasted two Spanish soldiers alive on the Catholic Holy day, a desecration which fanned their enthusiasm for the impending battle.|$|E
