5|$|At {{the end of}} 1899, Warner was {{appointed}} the school's athletic director and his salary more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought every book available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native American tradition, and students <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southwest</b> were known for their stamina in long-distance races.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{is located}} in the humid {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) being rare. Thus, cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> (which are not moderated by it).|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{moved on}} to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; {{government}} officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southwest</b> to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he and Moss sailed to California, again by way of Panama, and made {{their way back to}} Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon.|$|E

5|$|Other major streams that drained into Lake Cahuilla were Whitewater River {{from the}} north, and San Felipe Creek and Carrizo Creek <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> More minor {{drainage}} came from Arroyo Salado {{on the western}} shore, and Salt Creek and Mammoth Wash on the eastern shore. Additional unnamed drainages did exist. Drainage from the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these water systems are ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Perry Ellwood {{undertook}} major renovations which {{added and}} changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was {{moved from the}} south facade to its present position on the north facade. On {{the south side of}} the home a large brick terrace was added and the conservatory moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> side of the house to the rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the Leeward Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla.

5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|The next tributaries of Catawissa Creek going {{downstream}} are Dark Run and Little Catawissa Creek. Dark Run {{is close}} to four miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> Little Catawissa Creek is approximately ten miles long and flows into Catawissa Creek from the west, {{less than a mile}} downstream from Dark Run. Little Catawissa Creek starts near Centralia and passes by Ringtown.|$|E
5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest,</b> and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe is a {{landlocked}} country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S, and longitudes 25° and 34°E. Most {{of the country}} is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m. The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|By 1200UTC on February14, Nancy {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity {{and turned to the}} southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E

5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full {{sovereignty in}} the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at that time of year. Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest</b> corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E

5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned {{an assault}} in force against the four {{infantry}} battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish armoured division. Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2009, Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two more species of M.manavi-like Malagasy Miniopterus: M.brachytragos from northern Madagascar and M.mahafaliensis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> On {{the basis of}} cytochrome b sequences, they found that M.aelleni was most closely related to a clade of M.brachytragos, M.manavi, and another recently described Malagasy species, M.petersoni. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution. At some places (for example, Namoroka) four cryptic species of M.manavi-like bats, including M.aelleni, occur together.|$|E
5|$|The 28th Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division {{advanced}} from Beit Lid at 21:30 on {{an overnight}} march towards Masudiye Station and Sebustiye. They {{arrived at the}} 'Anebta road near Ramin at 01:30, and by 03:00 had advanced to capture the Masudiye Station along with an engine and 16 carriages, before continuing towards Sebustiye. During this march, a strong rearguard {{in the ruins of}} Samaria was attacked by the 51st and 53rd Sikhs. After working their way through an olive grove on the northwest side of the Central Powers' rearguard position, they attacked from the flank, with a platoon of 51st Sikhs gaining the crest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>southwest.</b> The garrison of 181 German (or Ottoman) soldiers was captured with eight light and heavy machine guns.
