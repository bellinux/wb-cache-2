It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Other {{indication}} of his passionate nature concerns an affair he {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning {{when they first met}} in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly contemptuous of it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests drew her to more mature men, such as Herbert Asquith, particularly if they had a reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend significant private time together on Capri.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> {{both men and women}} and women who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> a man in the 3 months before and <b>having</b> at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> a woman were compared <b>with</b> those who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> men only. RESULTS: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> both men and women <b>had</b> a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex <b>with</b> men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

The FISA protects telecommunications companies complicit in providing user information to federal law enforcement authorities. In addition to this the 2008 amendments, which were extended another five years at the end of 2012, allow the NSA (National Security Agency) to conduct electronic surveillance on any US citizen suspected of conversing with any person outside of the USA suspected by the US government of terrorist activities.

25|$|In May 2008, Dixie's spirit {{returns to}} Pine Valley. On {{a mission to}} reunite Tad with his daughter, she haunts Adam, telling him that she will only stop if he tells Tad where Kate is. Adam {{constantly}} refuses, but finally relents once Tad is shot by a deranged Rob Gardner at Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter's wedding, where celebration has just ended. As Tad experiences the life he could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Dixie while lying in Pine Valley hospital hanging between life and death, Adam calls out to him. At Tad's bedside, he tries to reach Tad through the unconscious. Dixie hears Adam calling Tad and smiles, still in Tad's embrace. Tad and Dixie say once last goodbye, after one last kiss, and part hands. Tad {{goes back to the}} land of the living to be a father to Kate.|$|E
25|$|In September 1921 Dhalla, {{accompanied}} by {{his wife and son}} (Nariman, who would eventually also study at Columbia), again proceeded to New York, this time to have his book Zoroastrian Civilization published. On the way, the family also spent four months in Iran and Iraq, where Dhalla again gave a series of lectures. Although Dhalla was appalled at the living conditions (not just of Zoroastrians), he found that the still-medieval infrastructure afforded him with opportunities for closer contacts with the people that he would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> more modern forms of transportation. In New York, Dhalla delivered lectures whenever the opportunity arose. Following the publication of his book, Dhalla and family returned to Karachi via London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Rome, and Naples, and felt the effects of the war that had ended only three years previously. Following a five-week layover in Bombay, they returned to Karachi in July 1922.|$|E

25|$|The Ca.331 O.A. won {{widespread}} {{praise from}} both the Italian and German pilots—including German fighter ace Werner Mölders (1913–1941) -- who tested it, and {{the chief of the}} German Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring (1893–1946), was given a demonstration of its capabilities at Guidonia Montecelio in January 1942. The reasons for the lack of a production order by either Italy or Germany remain obscure and a matter of debate. Reasons given by various sources include a supposed overreliance on the use of materials in the Ca.331s construction that may have been in scarce supply (although this itself is controversial) in wartime Italy and Germany; the use of too many parts in the Ca.331, uncommon with other Italian aircraft (although {{it is not clear what}} specifically these may have been); political problems that Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886–1957) may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> the Italian Fascist government (which have not been identified clearly); an unwillingness of the Italian military to cooperate too closely with their German counterparts for fear of being dominated by Germany in the event of a German victory in World War II; or simply that the Ca.331 was under development for so long that the requirement for it disappeared before it could enter production, a common problem in the Italian aircraft industry during the World War II years.|$|E

500|$|Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 criticizes Sega's poor {{timing of}} the launch of Sega Channel and the subscription's high price.

This horrendous blunder (one of many by Sega Enterprises) caused {{retailers}} to dump their inventory of systems, thereby sealing {{the fate of the}} Sega Channel once and for all." [...] Buchanan echoes the same sentiments, stating, [...] "Perhaps if the SEGA Channel had been released earlier in the console's lifecycle—the Genesis launched in 1989 in America—things might have turned out differently. After all, the service did gain notice for its advancement of gaming and technology." [...] UGO also notes the potential Sega Channel could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> some more development time in the field of competitive multiplayer, stating, [...] "If the Sega Channel had come a little earlier {{in the life of the}} Genesis it would have seen much more exposure, and maybe online play would have been feasible for games that could have been developed directly for the service." ...|$|E
