40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{successful}} use of hydrofoil {{systems on}} catamarans, {{such as the}} Hysucat, {{led to the development}} of a similar <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> for a high speed trimaran. Firstly a mathematical model was developed to calculate the equilibrium planing conditions of a planing trimaran. This was then used in the hydrodynamic design of a fully planing trimaran with a design speed of 65 kn. The mathematical model was then modified to include the effects of added hydrofoils. This model was then used to design a hydrofoil support system for the planing trimaran. Towing tank tests were then performed on a scale model of the boat, with and without the supporting hydrofoil system. This was done to verify the theoretical design and to gather resistance data, which could then be compared to other boats. The results showed a notable improvement in efficiency of the boat with the addition of foils. The conclusion was made that with the addition of a well-designed <b>foil</b> <b>system,</b> hull efficiencies similar to that expected for the Hysucat, can be attained when the <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> is added to the trimaran. As this work was focused mainly on the high-speed performance of the boat, it is not certain how the boat will perform through the speed-range.

Hu, Computational study on near wake interaction between undulation body and a D-section cylinder, Ocean Eng. 38 (2011) 673 – 683] which shows that, for a flow system with a D-sectional cylinder combined with an undulating NACA 0012 foil {{in the wake of}} a cylinder, cylinder drag force could be considerably reduced if the foil is properly placed in the cylinder wake. In this study, a further detailed parametric study on this coupled cylinder–undulating <b>foil</b> <b>system</b> is carried out by a numerical simulation. Particular interest is focused on how Reynolds number, the relative size of the foil to the cylinder, the foil undulating frequency, the wavelength and the gap between the cylinder and the foil affect the cylinder drag, lift force as well as foil thrust.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} a <b>foil</b> propulsion <b>system</b> on a supply vessel. In analysing {{the potential of}} a <b>foil</b> propulsion <b>system,</b> {{it is imperative to}} establish a rigid mathematical model. In that respect, modelling of the dynamic system is emphasised, and a comprehensive study is presented on the matter. The equations of motion for an oscillating foil and a vessel are derived, separately. The two systems are then combined, to form the coupled vessel-foil structure. For the vessel, a time-domain model based on Cummins' equation is proposed. Cummins' equation has proven efficient in assessing a unified seakeeping and manoeuvring problem (Fossen [2011]). In line, the vessel-foil system will be exposed to both vessel oscillatory motion due to waves and forward speed effects, i. e seakeeping and manoeuvring. Moreover, the efficiency of the foil is directly dependent on the two. Additionally, aspects of foil control is looked into. In theory, active control could maximise thrust while preventing stall, which would be ideal. The validity of simulations with active control, however, is highly dependent on the accuracy of the emph{basic} vessel-foil model. Consequently, effort has been focused on presenting a rigid mathematical foundation...|$|R

MIT's Biomimetic Flapping Foil Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is a prototype vehicle that uses four three-dimensional flapping foil actuators as its means of propulsion. The vehicle providing an opportunity for investigating the efficiency and maneuverability capabilities of a flapping <b>foil</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis presents and analyzes open-loop performance test data for the Biomimetic Flapping Foil Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The vehicle is capable of actuating in four different modes of motion, surge, heave, sway, and yaw. These four modes are explored through a range of flapping parameters. For each mode, the parameters were varied to obtain an approximate maximum velocity for the vehicle. Maximum velocity in surge was measured as 1. 3827 mis, in sway as 0. 4810 m/s, and in heave as 0. 3831 m/s. In yaw, the maximum angular velocity was measured as 80. 2 degrees per second. (cont.) The performance of the vehicle as reported in this thesis compare well to the previously recorded performance measurements and to theoretical estimates based on the capabilities of the actuators. However, measurements of performance would benefit greatly from better control during testing and from a larger testing space.

40|$|The {{power flow}} {{analysis}} approach, which arose from high frequency vibration problems, {{has been developed}} into a powerful technique to characterise the dynamic behaviour of complex structures and coupled systems. It has been extensively used to study various linear systems. However, because of the complexity in modelling and simulation, the power flow behaviour of nonlinear dynamical systems remains largely unexplored. This thesis aims to develop power flow analysis approaches for nonlinear dynamical systems, to investigate the effects of damping and/or stiffness nonlinearities on their power flow behaviour, and to apply the findings to enhance the performance of energy harvesting devices as well as vibration control systems. Power flow characteristics of the Du?ng and the Van der Pol (VDP) oscillators are investigated to address the distinct power input and dissipation behaviour due to stiffness and damping nonlinearities, respectively. It is shown that in a nonlinear velocity response with multiple frequency signatures, only the in-phase component of the same frequency as the harmonic excitation contributes to the time-averaged input power. It is demonstrated that bifurcations can cause significant jumps of time-averaged power flows, whereas the associated time-averaged input power of a chaotic response is insensitive to the initial conditions but tends to an asymptotic value as the averaging time increases. It is {{also found that the}} time averaged input power of the unforced VDP oscillator can become negative in some ranges of excitation frequencies. Power flow behaviour of two degrees-of-freedom systems with nonlinear stiffness/- damping is also studied using the developed methods to enhance vibration isolation/absorption performance. It is demonstrated that the stiffness and damping nonlinearities in the system affects time-averaged power flows mainly in a narrow frequency range around resonance frequencies. The work described in this thesis provides new insights into power flow generation, transmission and dissipation mechanisms in nonlinear dynamical systems and facilitates more reliable and effective designs with improved dynamic performance. The ability of the VDP oscillator to extract external energy sheds light on energy harvesting using flow-induced vibrations of a nonlinear flapping <b>foil</b> <b>system.</b> A nonlinear isolator with a negative stiffness mechanism is proposed providing less input power in an enlarged frequency range. These studies thus yield an improved understanding of power flow behaviour in nonlinear dynamical systems...|$|E
