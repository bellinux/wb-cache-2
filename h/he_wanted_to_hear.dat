5|$|On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime {{reporter}} Peter R. de Vries {{claimed that}} he had solved the Holloway case. De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3. On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that {{he was telling the}} individual what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and that he had no role in her disappearance. That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{feared that}} {{continued}} {{involvement in the}} war was a mistake that was endangering Johnson's presidency, but he felt too intimidated by the imposing Johnson to share his true feelings. Strauss immediately regretted withholding his true opinion from Johnson. He resolved that if any president ever sought his advice again, Strauss would tell him the truth regardless of what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
25|$|To rebuild cross-strait ties {{after the}} Sunflower Movement protests, Taiwan Affairs Office Minister Zhang Zhijun arrived in Taiwan on June 25 for a four-day visit {{as part of}} the 2014 Wang-Zhang Meeting. Zhang met with his Taiwanese counterpart, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi at the Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel, with groups of protesters held back by police cordons. Zhang and Wang agreed to {{establish}} a direct communication mechanism heralded as the first of its kind, which allows concerned officials from both sides to cut through the bureaucracy and make direct calls to discuss important matters. During the visit, Zhang mentioned <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> different voices from the ground, but no meetings had been scheduled with leaders of the Sunflower Movement. Instead, Zhang met with a pre-selected group of students.|$|E

500|$|Verdi had {{completed}} I masnadieri for London by May 1847 {{except for the}} orchestration. This he left until the opera was in rehearsal, since <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "la [...] Lind and modify her role to suit her more exactly." [...] Verdi agreed to conduct the premiere on 22 July 1847 at Her Majesty's Theatre, {{as well as the}} second performance. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the first performance, and for the most part, the press was generous in its praise.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2008 presidential election, Cryer {{attended}} a fundraiser {{hosted by the}} McCain campaign and, according to news reports, endorsed Senator John McCain. When Cryer {{did not make a}} public endorsement for the 2012 race, his spokeswoman said that the 2008 report aligning him with the Republican Party was a [...] "mistake" [...] and that Cryer is [...] "not really political." [...] He had attended events for both Republicans and Democrats [...] "because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what both sides had to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney Hoskyns {{describes}} [...] "Heylin's objections [...] {{the academic}} ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained {{some of the}} greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." [...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break." ...|$|E
5000|$|Orbán {{questioned}} Nord Stream II, a new Russia-Germany {{natural gas}} pipeline. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a [...] "reasonable argument why South Stream was bad and Nord Stream is not".

500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 2005, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad {{announced}} that his troops would leave Lebanon completely [...] "in {{the next few}} months". [...] Responding to the announcement, opposition leader Walid Jumblatt said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more specifics from Damascus about any withdrawal: [...] "It's a nice gesture but 'next few months' is quite vague - we need a clear-cut timetable".|$|E

[...] in order to gently begin conversing with Adam, so that Adam would not become startled and disconcerted by God's sudden appearance. The minister indicated that {{he was aware of}} that answer, but <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Rabbi Shneur Zalman's explanation.|$|E

When women facilitators were recruited, some women-only field schools started, while later even mixed schools emerged.

2500|$|Crouch-Hazlett {{appeared}} {{before a judge}} on Monday amidst a packed courtroom. Declaring that he [...] "didn't want any sensations," [...] the case against Crouch-Hazlett was continued until Thursday and she was roughly escorted from the courtroom by the bailiff. On the scheduled day the judge heard initial arguments and then declared that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the case fully argued and scheduled a trial for Wednesday, September 18, thereby holding Crouch-Hazlett {{in the city for}} 10 full days on a charge of blocking the sidewalk.|$|E
2500|$|Northcliffe {{also warned}} Haig's aide Philip Sassoon that changes were required: [...] "Sir Douglas is {{regarded}} with affection in the army, but everywhere people remark {{that he is}} surrounded by incompetents". Haig was required to dismiss Charteris. Robertson had arrived at Haig's Headquarters with orders (signed by Derby) for his dismissal in his pocket, in case Haig refused to do as he was asked. Haig claimed to his wife (14 December) that Charteris' work had been excellent but {{he felt he had}} to sack him because he had [...] "upset so many people". A common criticism is that Haig only accepted intelligence from Charteris (who told him what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear)</b> and did not cross-check it with other intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|He {{experimented with}} {{processed}} effects including varispeed, reverberation, slapback echo, and filtering signals through a Leslie speaker. Lyric collaborator Tony Asher remembers {{that in the}} 1960s: [...] "People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because nobody had ever used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did {{the same kind of}} experimenting, not {{to see if he could}} accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> And most of the time, it ended up on the record." ...|$|E

In a {{delicate}} scene full of ambiguous nuances, he tries to teach her to pronounce his name, recognizing what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> in her inarticulate bleating. He becomes mortally jealous of a black ram and finally stages a marriage ceremony on the lawn to cement his love. Alberto ruthlessly eliminates all those who refuse to understand his feelings, and story slips into blood-soaked horror mode.|$|R

2500|$|Local Lebanese {{pressure}} mounted as well. As daily {{protests against}} the Syrian occupation grew to 25,000, a series of dramatic events occurred. Massive protests such as these had been quite uncommon in the Arab world, and while in the 90s most anti-Syrian demonstrators were predominantly Christian, the new demonstrations were Christian and Sunni. [...] On February 28 the government of pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami resigned, calling for a new election to take place. [...] Mr Karami said in his announcement: [...] "I am keen the government {{will not be a}} hurdle in front of those who want the good for this country." [...] The tens of thousands gathered at Beirut's Martyrs' Square cheered the announcement, then chanted [...] "Karami has fallen, your turn will come, Lahoud, and yours, Bashar". [...] Opposition MPs were also not satisfied with Karami's resignation, and kept pressing for full Syrian withdrawal. [...] Former minister and MP Marwan Hamadeh, who survived a similar car bomb attack on October 1, 2004, said [...] "I accuse this government of incitement, negligence and shortcomings at the least, and of covering up its planning at the most... if not executing". [...] Two days later Syrian leader Bashar Assad announced that his troops will leave Lebanon completely [...] "in the next few months". [...] Responding to the announcement, opposition leader Walid Jumblatt said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more specifics from Damascus about any withdrawal: [...] "It's a nice gesture but 'next few months' is quite vague – we need a clear-cut timetable".|$|E

5000|$|Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, stating, [...] "Richter takes techniques from the classics and modifies {{their approach to}} make more appropriate-- but no less efficacious-- statements for his own circumstances. Given Songs from Befores thematic conceit, this is appropriate: Richter isnt interested in changing {{the way the world}} hears his music as much as idealizing how <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it. <b>He</b> resurrects past idols for present idioms, his heroes, proclivities and experiences donned as unrepentantly as the nostalgia at Songs core." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wilson rephrases this himself {{many times}} as [...] "communication occurs only between equals". Celine calls this law [...] "a simple {{statement}} of the obvious" [...] and refers {{to the fact that}} everyone who labors under an authority figure tends to lie to and flatter that authority figure in order to protect themselves either from violence or from deprivation of security (such as losing one's job). In essence, it is usually more in the interests of any worker to tell his boss what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> not what is true.|$|R
5000|$|Lennon's lead vocals were {{initially}} overdubbed and featured a characteristic unheard before on a Beatles song, as aforementioned by Ringo: “’Girl’ was great - weird breathy sound on it.” Paul explains, “My main memory is that John <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the breathing, <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> be very intimate, so George Martin put a special compressor on the voice, then John dubbed it...I remember John {{saying to the}} engineer (Norman Smith) when we did ‘Girl,’ that when he draws his breath in, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it.
