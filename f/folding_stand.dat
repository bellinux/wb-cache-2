50|$|A combo organ is an {{electronic}} portable organ, usually transistorized (although some older designs used tubes; and later models, integrated circuits), {{that was designed}} for use on stage, usually {{in the context of}} a band or group. A combo organ is usually supported on a removable or <b>folding</b> <b>stand</b> or legs; these originally would have been supplied as part of the instrument. Combo organs were best known for their bright, reedy sound; their portability; surprising versatility; and relatively low cost. Most such instruments have no built-in amplification.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Folding</b> <b>stands</b> {{range from}} inexpensive, {{lightweight}} models made of metal, which {{are designed to}} hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> often have solid wire extensions or metal [...] "arms" [...] which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in youth orchestras. Lightweight <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> are designed to collapsible; if <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for rehearsals, auditions and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non-folding stands.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of music stands for {{different}} purposes and intended users. <b>Folding</b> <b>stands</b> collapse, which makes them convenient to take to rehearsals and performances out of the home. <b>Folding</b> <b>stands</b> are typically used by amateur musicians at rehearsals and performances. Professional musicians {{are more likely to}} limit their use of <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> to rehearsals held outside of normal performance venues (e.g., a chamber music rehearsal at a private home) or small gigs. Non-folding stands tend to be used by professional orchestras and big bands for rehearsals and concerts.|$|R

50|$|With outdoor performances, {{users of}} music stands can face {{challenges}} due to wind blowing {{the pages of}} sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal clips or clothes pins {{on the sides of}} the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight <b>folding</b> <b>stand</b> may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base.|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} governing protein <b>folding</b> <b>stand</b> {{as one of}} {{the biggest}} challenges of Biophysics. Modeling the global stability of proteins and predicting their tertiary structure are hard tasks, due in part to the variety and large number of forces involved and the difficulties to describe them with sufficient accuracy. We have developed a fast, physics-based empirical potential, intended to be used in global structure prediction methods. This model considers four main contributions: Two entropic factors, the hydrophobic effect and configurational entropy, and two terms resulting from a decomposition of close-packing interactions, namely the balance of the dispersive interactions of folded and unfolded states and electrostatic interactions between residues. The parameters of the model were fixed from a protein data set whose unfolding free energy has been measured at the >standard> experimental conditions proposed by Maxwell et al. (2005) and a large data set of 1151 monomeric proteins obtained from the PDB. A blind test with proteins taken from ProTherm database, at similar experimental conditions, was carried out. We found a good correlation with the test data set, proving the effectiveness of our model for predicting protein folding free energies in considered standard conditions. Such a prediction compares favorably against estimations made with FoldX's function and the force field GROMOS 96. This model constitutes a valuable tool for the fast evaluation of protein structure stability in 3 D structure prediction methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Lightweight stands are not {{designed}} to support heavy books of music such as full-size fake books; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. <b>Folding</b> <b>stands</b> consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for supporting the rack, with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. <b>Folding</b> <b>stands</b> typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).|$|R

This was achieved on 8 February 1921 when Dick Kerr Ladies beat a Rest of Lancashire XI 10-0. £600 was raised for the Ashton-under-Lyne Infirmary, which forms part of Tameside Hospital. Stalybridge Celtic's record attendance was achieved on 17 January 1923, against West Bromwich Albion. 9,753 spectators saw Stalybridge Celtic lose 2-0 in a F.A. Cup First Round Proper replay.|$|R
5000|$|In opera, {{ballet and}} musical theatre, the {{orchestra}} (or {{band in the}} case of musicals) often plays in an orchestra pit in front of and at a lower level than the main performance stage. For dramatic reasons, the stage may be darkened at times during the performance, and the house lights turned off. This darkness could pose challenges for the musicians who are reading parts or chord charts in the pit. To resolve this challenge, small stand lights are clipped onto the tops of stands. To avoid having the stand lights distract audience members, some venues have cloth [...] "hoods" [...] over the lights. Originally, stand lights were incandescent, requiring extension cords running throughout the pit and regular bulb changes. In the 2000s, as LED lights became more affordable, battery powered LED lights have become widely used. LED lights do not need extension cords and the bulbs almost never need replacement. Stand lights do not clip as securely to thin <b>folding</b> <b>stands.</b> Stand lights clip more securely onto the solid rack of a professional, non-folding stand. A Canadian viola player invented a stand with a built-in LED light, for dark performing settings.|$|R

40|$|Protein <b>folding</b> <b>stands</b> {{as one of}} {{the major}} {{interdisciplinary}} challenges of the last ten years, involving biology, chemistry, medicine and physics. In this PhD thesis, we investigate the solvent effects and the resulting hydrophobic effect on proteins. In particular, we focus on a simple lattice model of proteins (the HPW model), where the solvent is (semi) explicitly taken into account (by means of the model of Muller, Lee and Graziano (MLG)), investigating thermodynamical quantities of the modeled proteins and comparing the results with those of real proteins. We approach the protein design problem using the HPW model and we investigate some statistical and thermodynamic properties of the designed sequences. In particular we show that the HPW model is able to capture, within a single framework, both warm and cold denaturation of proteins. We further adapt the MLG model model to include chaotrope cosolvents in the solution. We show that the alteration of the network of hydrogen bonds between water molecules due to the presence of chaotropic agents induces destabilization of proteins. Moreover, we find that the presence of chaotropes originates an effective interaction between the chaotropes and the protein. In addition, we use a common method to extract effective amino-acid interactions on real proteins: a perceptron algorithm. The method applied to proteins designed with the HPW model reveals that the solvent effects can not be reproduced by effective residue interactions. Indeed, we show that {{it is not possible to}} determine a set of global interaction values able to stabilize all proteins at once...|$|R
