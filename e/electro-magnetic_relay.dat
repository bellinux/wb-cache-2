50|$|The human {{settlers}} from Earth {{have come}} to Alflolol, which they have named Technorog, attracted by the valuable natural resources it offers. To provide protection, they have placed huge <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>relay</b> beacons on the asteroids in the belt that rings the planet. When activated these beacons generate an impenetrable shield around the planet. Ingress and egress is only permitted to authorised spacecraft through a narrow channel that can be opened in the asteroid belt. Alflolol's harsh atmospheric conditions are harmful to humans if exposure to them is prolonged so they live under domes and wear protective clothing when working outside. The domes also simulate an Earth-like cycle of day and night. The capital city they have constructed is called Technorogville and it lies on a hill on the ancestral burial site of Algol's family. Nearby is a forest, known as Ananil to the Alflololians, {{which leads to the}} shores of the sea, named Magnet Ocean by the humans, where the settlers use floating platforms to extract magnetic salts which fuel the ultra-light motors of Galaxity's spacecraft. In the surrounding mountains, gigantic mines extract rare metals which are processed and used in manufacturing in the colossal factories that lie on the plains near the desert. Great hydroponic plantations are required to feed the workers who keep this vast enterprise going. The planet is administered by a technocrat Governor who reports to a council representing the business interests on the planet.|$|E
40|$|An <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>relay</b> {{model is}} setup using a {{generalized}} Kirchhoff-network approach. The model features several mechanical nonlinear elements (stops), a nonlinear model for magnetization {{based on the}} Jiles-Atherton model and a nonlinear model for the non homogeneous magnetization of the anchor at the air gap. The model is tested using different voltage signals applied to the coil of the magnet system with varying positions of the mechanical stops. The simulation results are compared to data measured on a specially prepared relay, which allows to adjust {{the positions of the}} mechanical stops as well. The simulated and measured data agree well, which enables indirect determination of mechanical parameters through electric measurements...|$|E
40|$|System (MEMS) {{relay system}} is facing so many {{challenges}} {{due to the}} relay’s small micro size. Numerous methods have been invented in latching the relay with {{the most efficient way}} possible. The small micro relay requires larger contact separation to create isolation between the two contacts to avoid accidental short circuit. This could not be achieved by having a conventional relay system which requires high power to turn on the magnetic coil. This high current could destroy any other circuit in MEMS system due to its tiny track width that could burn easily like a fuse. A project on novel actuation method for <b>electro-magnetic</b> micro <b>relays</b> is carried out to search for an alternative solution to the problem. The method used in this project is by applying pulse trigger to encourage oscillations of the relay cantilever from its natural frequency until the relay latches. A model of such system has been designed to demonstrate how this technique is being implemented. Index Terms — Actuation method, MEMS, Micro relays, latch. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Microrelays {{with liquid}} metal wetted {{contacts}} {{have been demonstrated}} using bidirectional electrothermal <b>electro-magnetic</b> actuators. These <b>relays</b> were fabricated with the MetalMUMPs foundry process, which has a 20 -µm-thick nickel structural layer. The operating voltage is under 0. 5 V. The mea-sured breakdown voltage and OFF-state resistance are greater than 200 V and 100 MΩ, respectively, and the gold-to-gold contact resistance is around 0. 3 Ω. When the contacts are wetted with liquid gallium alloy (melting point at − 20 ◦C), the measured contact resistance can be as low as 0. 015 Ω. As such, these bidi-rectional relays could have potential applications in high-power switching systems with low contact resistance using liquid metal wetted contacts.
