6000|$|Girths.--A roll {{of spare}} webbing {{should be taken}} to patch up torn girths; but a good {{substitute}} for a girth is made by cutting a band of tanned, or even of <b>dressed,</b> <b>leather,</b> to within four inches of its end, into seven or nine bands, and plaiting these together. But it takes a beginner just ten times as long to plait a girth as to weave it, and, therefore, for making more than one girth, it is well worth while to set up a rude loom. Do this as though you were making a mat. (See [...] "Mat.") Girths need not be buckled; they may be laced.|$|E

Wright (1823) gives some statistics — 77 men & boys employed as Leather dressers and Glove-cutters, 40 boys employed as Dusters and 1,111 women employed as Sewers.

In a year they dealt with 5,000 hides and 12,000 calf skins. They supplied local saddlers, bootmakers and cobblers.Hexham also had 16 master hatters, and the trade employed 40 persons. There were two woollen manufactories, worked by steam power, and two rope manufactories. There were corn water mills below the bridge.

The men pull a length of duffel cloth—if they have it—under this belt, front and rear, and pass it between the legs. It is over half an ell [...] wide and nine quarter-ells [...] long, which leaves a square flap hanging down in front and back… Before duffel cloth was common in that country, and sometimes even now when it cannot be had, they took for that purpose some <b>dressed</b> <b>leather</b> or fur—The women also wear a length of woolen cloth of full width [...] and an ell and a quarter [...] long, which comes halfway down the leg. It is like a petticoat, but under it, next to the body, they wear a deerskin which also goes around the waist and ends in cleverly cut pointed edging and fringes. The wealthier women {{and those who have}} a liking for it wear such skirts wholly embroidered with wampum… As for covering {{the upper part of the}} body both men and women use a sheet of duffel cloth of full width, i.e. nine and a half quarter-ells, and about three ells [...] long. It is usually worn over the right shoulder and tied in a knot around the waist and from there hangs down to the feet.|$|E
