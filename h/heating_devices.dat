25|$|Advantages of {{electric}} heating methods over other forms include precision control of temperature {{and distribution of}} heat energy, combustion not used to develop heat, {{and the ability to}} attain temperatures not readily achievable with chemical combustion. Electric heat can be accurately applied at the precise point needed in a process, at high concentration of power per unit area or volume. Electric <b>heating</b> <b>devices</b> can be built in any required size and can be located anywhere within a plant. Electric heating processes are generally clean, quiet, and do not emit much byproduct heat to the surroundings. Electrical heating equipment has a high speed of response, lending it to rapid-cycling mass-production equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Electric heating is {{a process}} in which {{electrical}} energy is converted to heat. Common applications include space heating, cooking, water heating and industrial processes. An electric heater is an electrical device that converts electric current to heat. The heating element inside every electric heater is an electrical resistor, and works on the principle of Joule heating: an electric current passing through a resistor will convert that electrical energy into heat energy. Most modern electric <b>heating</b> <b>devices</b> use nichrome wire as the active element; the heating element, depicted on the right, [...] uses nichrome wire supported by ceramic insulators.|$|E

40|$|In {{preparation}} for a trial on co-prescription of inhalable heroin and methadone, two methods for inhalation of heroin/caffeine tablets were compared: the commonly used method of 'chasing the dragon' and a standardised procedure for inhalation of volatilised heroin, using a <b>heating</b> <b>device.</b> Five male addicts inhaled a tablet of smokable heroin daily for 5 days, alternating the inhalation method. Plasma concentrations of heroin, 6 -acetylmorphine, morphine and morphine- 3 - and - 6 -glucuronide were determined using a liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection. The exposure to heroin and its metabolites (expressed as areas under the concentrationtime curve) was significantly lower after smoking via the <b>heating</b> <b>device</b> than after 'chasing the dragon': heroin 80 % and 6 -acetylmorphine 73 % lower (p < 0. 05).
