5|$|As various {{agreements}} were reached, activities <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> gradually {{shifted to}} Brussels and the Parliament, although bound {{to remain in}} Strasbourg, also started to work in Brussels while the courts remained <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg.</b> The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including {{the division of the}} Parliament's work between the three cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself in Brussels.|$|E

5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels, the Courts <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg.</b> Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based in Brussels (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).|$|E

5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also have to hold sessions <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite this, the European Economic Community and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome.

This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible <b>in</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E
