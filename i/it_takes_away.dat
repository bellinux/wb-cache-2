However, White often prefers not to play 3.c4, since <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> a useful square from a white knight. Several lines of the King's Indian Defence, such as the Four Pawns Attack, the Sämisch Variation and the Fianchetto Variation, can also transpose into variations of the Modern Benoni if Black plays ...c5 followed by ...e6 and ...exd5 and White recaptures with the c-pawn.|$|E
500|$|Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as {{plans were}} being made to enter the {{recording}} studio. His said he left the band for [...] "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".

Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, [...] "When someone does a side project, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is [...] "like cheating on your wife in a way". Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film , and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, [...] "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, [...] "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?" ...|$|E

These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|E

Having been informed by Jeschonnek and Hitler that he was to assume command of Luftlfotte 4 after the fall of Sevastopol earlier, they decided not to wait. They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of von Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt it was ridiculous to move him mid-operation, and he had wanted to be there when the fortress fell. He wrote, [...] "It is a pity that one can never finish what one starts in the east.

2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E

Does he sell shirts? Is it his band? Newsted's departure from Metallica, along with Hetfield's decision to go to rehab a few months later, almost led to a breakup of the band.
