Meanwhile, her husband Walter Wanger drove by at about 2:30p.m. and noticed his wife's car parked there. Half an hour later, he again saw her car there and stopped to wait. Bennett and Lang drove into the parking lot a few hours later and he walked her to her convertible. As she started the <b>engine,</b> <b>turned</b> on the headlights and prepared to drive away, Lang leaned on the car, with both hands raised to his shoulders, and talked to her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{power plant}} was a double-expansion steam engine, with high-pressure cylinder 25 inches in diameter, low-pressure of 48-inch diameter, and {{a stroke of}} 30 inches, and drove the ship, at least nominally, at 12 miles per hour. [...] Coal consumption was 12 tons in 24 hours. [...] Boiler pressure was 100 pounds of steam and the <b>engine</b> <b>turned</b> 92 revolutions per minute at top speed.|$|E
2500|$|The Lockheed design {{incorporated}} {{tricycle undercarriage}} and a bubble canopy, and featured two [...] turbosupercharged 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines fitted with counter-rotating propellers {{to eliminate the}} effect of engine torque, with the turbochargers positioned behind the engines, the exhaust side of the units exposed along the dorsal surfaces of the booms. Counter-rotation was achieved {{by the use of}} [...] "handed" [...] engines, which meant the crankshaft of each <b>engine</b> <b>turned</b> in the opposite direction of its counterpart, a relatively easy task for a modular-design aircraft powerplant as the V-1710.|$|E

2500|$|These {{included}} {{his balance}} designs, helical springs {{made of steel}} or gold, the spring detent escapement, the overcoil balance spring, and even the layout of an Arnold dial design that Breguet incorporated into his own. These were made from engine-turned gold or silver—a pattern that became the classic and distinctive Breguet dial. Arnold's pattern first appeared in 1783, on the enamel dials Arnold designed for his small chronometers, and the proportions and layout of their figuring is identical {{to that of the}} classic [...] "Breguet" [...] type of <b>engine</b> <b>turned</b> metal dials which appeared around 1800, and which were quite unlike anything else made in France or Switzerland at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Prototypes for the Ki-43-II flew in February 1942. The Ha-25 {{engine was}} {{upgraded}} with the 2-stage supercharger, thus becoming {{the more powerful}} Nakajima Ha-115 engine, which was installed in a longer-chord cowling. The new <b>engine</b> <b>turned</b> a three-bladed propeller. The wing structure, which had suffered failures in the Ki-43-I, was strengthened and equipped with racks for drop tanks or bombs. The Ki-43-II was also fitted with 13mm armor plate for the pilot's head and back, and the aircraft's fuel tanks were coated in rubber to form a crude self-sealing tank. This was later replaced by 3-layer rubber bladder, 8mm core with 2mm oil-proof lamination. The [...] bladder {{has proven to be}} highly resistant against 7.7mm bullets, but was not as effective against larger calibers. The pilot also enjoyed a slightly taller canopy and a reflector gunsight in place of the earlier telescopic gunsight. Nakajima commenced production of the Ki-43-II at its Ota factory in November 1942. Production was also started at the Tachikawa Hikoki KK and the 1st Army Air Arsenal (Tachikawa Dai-Ichi Rikugun Kokusho), also at Tachikawa. Although Tachikawa Hikoki successfully managed to enter into large-scale production of the Ki-43, the 1st Army Air Arsenal was less successful – hampered by a shortage of skilled workers, it was ordered to stop production after 49 Ki-43s were built. Nakajima eventually ceased production in mid-1944 in favor of the Ki-84, but the Tachikawa Hikoki continued to produce the Ki-43.|$|E

With no electric starter installed, engines can be restarted by diving the aircraft to increase airspeed and the rotation speed of the 'windmilling' propeller.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of colors (including {{two-tone}} paint schemes) were available. Two-tone schemes initially involved the front upper body, the roof, and a panel on the tail being painted the contrast color, {{with the rest of}} the body the base color. Later 1956 production had the upper body above the belt line, including the trunk, as the contrast color with the tail panel, roof, and the body below the belt line trim being the base color.
