5000|$|From Bob Dyer's column [...] "Dyer Streets" [...] in the Akron Beacon Journal..."Victory for Vern" [...] We {{have lost}} our Vodom.Unlike losing your mojo, losing your Vodom {{is a good}} thing.For those of you <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> Akron City Council voted in 2002 to rename Wooster Avenue to honor a legendary local civil rights leader named Vernon Odom.But the bill's sponsor, Marco Sommerville — {{operating}} {{on the assumption that}} everyone who worked for the city was familiar with the man — scrawled out a quick Post-It Note to the street department requesting signs for the new V Odom Boulevard.The street department took him literally and created V Odom street signs, then passed along his request, verbatim, to the Ohio Department of Transportation, which is responsible for the big signs on the interstates.Thus, we were Vodomized.The word Vodom entered the local lexicon, turning the honor into a joke.Fortunately, Odom's first name wasn't Sam, Stu or Stan. But still — this certainly wasn't what his friends and colleagues had in mind.Now, finally, freeway drivers have been fully introduced to Vernon Odom.Unfortunately, a few signshere and there have retained their Vodomism — including one marking the boulevard's exit off of another boulevard named for one of Odom's college classmates — Martin Luther King Jr.But perhaps in another six years we can fix those, too.|$|E

The course is aimed at acquiring an active vocabulary in practical everyday topics and developing a familiarity with various aspects of Russian culture. Students should expect considerable homework assignments, regular compositions, and class discussions. I will also require that students participate in the Russian table which will meet every Monday from 4 : 30 to 6 pm. You are not obligated {{to be there for}} the entire time, <b>just</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> at any point during the allotted time and {{for as long as you}} wish...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{biggest problem}} in {{increasing}} awareness, I think, is that environmental protection still involves nothing but slogans. While many people see {{a conflict between}} economic development and environmental protection, I believe that when you come closer to nature {{to learn more about}} it, you will find no real conflict between the two. On the contrary, a deteriorating environment makes economic development a 'mission impossible.' It is just like when people sacrifice health to make money and then have to spend that money to recover their health. The Green Earth Volunteers is a big family of nature lovers.

Other Furious Five members included his brother Kid Creole (Nathaniel Glover), Scorpio (Eddie Morris), Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams) and Cowboy (Keith Wiggins). While a member of the group, Cowboy created the term hip-hop while teasing a friend who had <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>US</b> Army, by scat singing the words [...] "hip/hop/hip/hop" [...] in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers.|$|R

2500|$|Keith [...] "Cowboy" [...] Wiggins, {{a member}} of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, has been {{credited}} with coining the term in 1978 while teasing {{a friend who had}} <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>US</b> Army by scat singing the made-up words [...] "hip/hop/hip/hop" [...] in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers. Cowboy later worked the [...] "hip hop" [...] cadence into his stage performance. The group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them [...] "hip hoppers". The name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect, but soon came to identify this new music and culture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. However, Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and DJ Hollywood used the term when the music was still known as disco rap. It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing {{a friend who had}} <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army, by scat singing the words [...] "hip/hop/hip/hop" [...] in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy later worked the [...] "hip hop" [...] cadence into a part of his stage performance, which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in [...] "Rapper's Delight". Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music. The first use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.|$|R

"Seven minutes now {{away from}} two o'clock, {{and we have}} to {{apologize}} to you for interrupting our normal programme schedule with these urgent messages, but as you can probably appreciate, something rather drastic has happened.

We're refusing to allow anybody this radio ship, and if you've <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> perhaps you'd like to be put in the picture, that a tug has come alongside, along with a person by the name of Kees Manders, who apparently is a well known figure in Holland, and he is trying to take the ship away. Our Captain has only allowed him on board, and nobody else, and that will remain that way. We're not going to let anybody else on board the ship, only Mr Manders, to hear what he's got to say, but Radio North Sea International will stay broadcasting until we receive a definite order from our Head office in Zurich. So if anybody is listening in Zurich, or in London, or in our office in The Hague, in Scheveningen, perhaps they would like to do something, perhaps send a boat out, or perhaps try to make contact with us on the short-wave[...] [...] Well, the situation is[...] [...] none of us are sure what's happening at the moment but this certainly isn't an authorized tug[...] [...] we have no tugs[...] [...] the Mebo is in no need of a tug because we have perfectly good engines[...] [...] The Captain allowed one of the men on board, but he refused to let any more on board, which is his prerogative[...] [...] {{and this is the way}} it's going to stay until we receive details or instructions from our head office.

5000|$|Grandmaster Flash played {{parties and}} collaborated with rappers such as Kurtis Blow and Lovebug Starski. In the mid 1970s, he formed his own group. The {{original}} lineup consisted of Cowboy (Keith Wiggins), Melle Mel (Melvin Glover) and Kid Creole (AKA Kidd Creole/Nathaniel Glover), and the ensemble {{went by the}} name [...] "Grandmaster Flash & the 3 MCs". Cowboy created the term hip hop. He created the term while teasing {{a friend who had}} <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army, by scat singing the words [...] "hip/hop/hip/hop" [...] in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy later worked the [...] "hip hop" [...] cadence into a part of his stage performance. Mel was the first rapper to call himself [...] "MC" [...] (Master of Ceremony). Two other rappers briefly joined, but they were replaced more permanently by Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams, previously in the Funky Four) and Scorpio (Eddie Morris, a.k.a. Mr. Ness) to make Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Quickly gaining recognition for their skillful raps, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five pioneered MCing and freestyle battles. Some of the staple phrases in MCing have their origins in the early shows and recordings of the group. In 1978, the new group began performing regularly at Disco Fever in the Bronx, one of the first times a hip-hop group was given a weekly gig at a well-known venue.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Furious Five, Grandmaster Flash worked with the [...] "L Brothers" [...] which consisted of [...] "Mean Gene" [...] Livingston, Claudio Livingston and Grand Wizzard Theodore. Flash then recruited his friend Cowboy, Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole. The trio called themselves the Three MC's who are the first emcee group as it relates to rap as we know it today. Cowboy, through his use of a [...] "scat routine" [...] (borrowed from a U.S. Army cadence) that the culture's early detractors used to label the music, thus the term [...] "hip hoppers" [...] (meant as an insult) was used by the disco set to describe the culture, later whittled down to hip hop. While using this [...] "scat routine" [...] at a party (at [...] "The Black Door") for a friend who had <b>just</b> <b>joined</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Army, Cowboy began scat singing the words [...] "hip/hop/hip/hop" [...] in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of the marching drill. He then worked the [...] "hip hop" [...] cadence into part of his performance this evolved into the term [...] "Hip Hop" [...] (which embodied the then subculture's or [...] "street culture's" [...] essence) that was later adopted by the industry [...] Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole were the first rappers to call themselves [...] "MCs" [...] (Masters of Ceremonies). The 3 emcees worked with Flash, who went on to bring in Mr. Ness/Scorpio (Eddie Morris) and Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams). After {{the formation}} of the Furious 5, Flash also worked with rapper Kurtis Blow doing parties in Queens. During the time Flash worked with Kurtis Blow, it was mainly due to internal disputes with the emcees, so for a short time prior {{to the formation}} of the Cold Crush Brothers in 1981, DJ Charlie Chase was the Furious 5's DJ.|$|R
