One hundred Sprague-Dawley male rats (280 – 320 g) were randomly divided into healthy control group (N group) and hemorrhagic shock group (H group). Each group was subdivided into <b>HO</b> 1 <b>t,</b> <b>HO</b> 2 <b>t,</b> <b>HO</b> 3 <b>t,</b> PBS and LL groups in which rats were intragastrically injected with LL-HO- 1 once, twice and three times, PBS and L. lactis (LL), respectively. The mortality, intestinal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, intestinal contents of TNF-α, IL- 10 and HO- 1, and intestinal Chiu's score were determined. Results showed that in N group, the HO- 1 content increased after LL-HO- 1 treatment, and significant difference was observed in <b>HO</b> 1 <b>t</b> group and <b>HO</b> 2 <b>t</b> group (P< 0. 05). In H groups, MPO activity and Chiu's score decreased, but IL- 10 content increased in LL-HO- 1 -treated groups when compared with PBS and LL groups (P< 0. 05). When compared with N group, the MPO activity reduced dramatically in LL-HO- 1 -treated groups. Thus, in healthy rats (N group), intragastrical LL-HO- 1 treatment may increase the intestinal HO- 1 expression, but has no influence on the intestinal barrier. In hemorrhagic shock rats, LL-HO- 1 may significantly protect the intestinal barrier, and repeating the intragastrical LL-HO- 1 treatments twice has the most obvious protection...|$|R

B. and postdoctoral research fellowship, M. F.). A hierarchical hormonal cascade along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis orchestrates bodily responses to stress. Although corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), produced by parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and released into the portal circulation at the median eminence, is known to prime downstream hormone release, the molecular mechanism regulating phasic CRH release remains poorly understood. Here, we find a cohort of parvocellular cells interspersed with magnocellular PVN neurons expressing secretagogin. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with protein interactome profiling identifies secretagogin neurons as a distinct CRH-releasing neuron population reliant on secretagogin's Ca 2 + sensor properties and protein interactions with the vesicular traffic and exocytosis release machineries to liberate this key hypothalamic releasing hormone. Pharmacological tools combined with RNA interference demonstrate that secretagogin's loss of function occludes adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary and lowers peripheral corticosterone levels in response to acute stress. Cumulatively, these data define a novel secretagogin neuronal locus and molecular axis underpinning stress responsiveness. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop a requirement-driven decision support methodology for remediation of concrete bridges within acceptable limits of safety, serviceability and sustainability. The proposed model includes two phases: Phase one is focused on condition assessment and priority ranking of bridge projects which makes use of an integrated priority index addressing a variety of factors. Phase two includes a multi criteria decision making technique which is able to select the best remediation strategy at both project and network level. The modified Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) is used as a decision analysis tool that employs the eigenvector approach of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for criteria weighting.

40|$|Abstract: An {{infrastructure}} {{system is}} inherently complex, {{with layers of}} both defined and subtle interfaces with other infrastructure systems and human users. High availability is desired, which implies stringent requirements on reliability and safety. Reliability analysis typically starts at component or sub-system level and aggregates through the system functional hierarchy. Because of the system complexity, incorporating occurrences of all possible interactions and scenarios is not always practical and failure data is often limited. Moreover, there are unobserved events among the sub-systems distributing either randomly or with temporal trend. To facilitate reliability analysis amid the complex environment and uncertain data, this paper proposes a general framework on modelling and aggregating reliability for complex systems with distinctive statistical approaches. The underlying principles will be illustrated and the suitability of the proposed techniques {{with respect to the}} data available will be discussed.

40|$|The initial goal of {{this work}} was to build up an entirely new {{low-temperature}} scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ultrahigh vacuum system to examine the electron- and photon-induced chemistry of single molecules at low surface temperatures where thermal diffusion would be quenched. The photochemistry of methyl bromide on Pt(111) was first examined at 90 K using liquid nitrogen cooling. Br atoms were quite mobile even at 90 K, and were only visible by STM when coalesced along Pt step edges or in Br islands structures. The 193 nm photofragmentation of methyl bromide efficiently created monovacancies in the substrate at 90 K. It was found that at elevated temperatures there is considerable restructuring and reactive attack of the Pt surface by halogens, but for traditional, lower temperature studies of alkyl radicals prepared by thermal dissociative adsorption of alkyl iodides there is probably no problem with adsorbing I generating monovacancies on the surface. The dynamics of the <b>ho</b> <b>t</b> Br atoms formed by dissociative adsorption of Br{sub 2 } was also examined. It was discovered that hot Br atoms from Br{sub 2 } dissociative adsorption travel farther than hot O atoms from O{sub 2 } dissociative adsorption; hot atom motion from different dissociative adsorption systems had not previously been compared for the same metal substrate. The experimental results strengthened the theoretical case that corrugation of the adsorbate/substrate potential is the key issue in determining hot atom travel. In addition, the data provided strong evidence for the transient existence of a weakly adsorbed and mobile Br{sub 2 } precursor to dissociative adsorption.

Using transient transfection of subgenomic HPV DNA into hamster CHO and human 293 cells, we have localized an {{origin of replication}} (ori) to an 80 -bp segment in the upstream regulatory region spanning nucleotide 1. It overlaps the E 6 promoter region and contains a short A + T-rich segment and a sequence which is homologous to the binding site of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) E 1 protein in the BPV- 1 ori. However, unlike the BPV- 1 ori, for which half an E 2 -responsive sequence (E 2 -RS) or binding site suffices, an intact binding site {{is essential for the}} HPV- 11 ori. Replication was more efficient when additional E 2 -RSs were present. The intact HPV- 11 genome also replicated in both cell lines when supplied with E 1 and E 2 proteins. Expression vectors of transcription repressor proteins that lack the N-terminal domain essential for E 2 transcriptional trans activation did not support replication in collaboration with the E 1 expression vector. Rather, cotransfection with the repressor expression vectors inhibited ori replication by the E 1 and E 2 proteins. These results demonstrate the importance of the N-terminal domain of the E 2 protein in DNA replication and indicate that the family of E 2 proteins positively and negatively regulates both viral DNA replication and E 6 promoter transcription...|$|E

The median TTV (cc) in Ho's stage I to IV disease were: 7. 6 (range: 1. 3 - 42. 7), 19. 8 (3. 2 - 55. 7), 40. 7 (4. 1 - 222. 7), and 51. 1 (3. 1 - 274. 7). Patients with a large PTV (> 60 cc) were associated with significantly poorer local control (5 -year local control rate: 56 %) and disease-specific survival (5 -year survival rate: 53 %). In patients with a small PTV (≤ 20 cc), {{there were no significant differences}} in local control among different T stages. Large NTV (> 30 cc) was associated with significantly higher distant failure rate (5 -year distant relapse-free survival rate: 54 %) and lower disease-specific survival (5 -year survival rate: 40 %). In multivariate analysis, only PTV was found to be an independent factor in predicting local control. Conclusion: A large variation of tumor volume was present in different T stage disease of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and PTV represents an independent prognostic factor of local control that appears to be more predictive than <b>Ho's</b> <b>T</b> stage classification. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
