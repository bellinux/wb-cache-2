500|$|Although the {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by several reviewers, some found {{the game to}} be unnecessarily long, repetitive and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival, requiring players {{to spend most of}} their time hiding in lockers [...] "staring at the motion tracker". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the alien creature, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, [...] "Every time I thought I heard the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed." [...] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered a [...] "brave" [...] title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. As of January 2015, Alien: Isolation has sold over one million copies worldwide according to Sega. As of March 2015, the game has sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|In the French {{edition of}} [...] "Lutetia" [...] Heine wrote, {{one year before}} he died: [...] "This confession, that the future belongs to the Communists, I made with an {{undertone}} of the greatest fear and sorrow and, oh!, this undertone by no means is a mask! Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist .... <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> there are two voices in their favour which cannot be silenced .... because {{the first one is}} that of logic ... and as I cannot object to the premise [...] "that all {{people have the right to}} eat", I must defer to all the conclusions....The second of the two compelling voices, of which I am talking, is even more powerful than the first, because it is the voice of hatred, the hatred I dedicate to this common enemy that constitutes the most distinctive contrast to communism and that will oppose the angry giant already at the first instance – I am talking about the party of the so-called advocates of nationality in Germany, about those false patriots whose love for the fatherland only exists in the shape of imbecile distaste of foreign countries and neighbouring peoples and who daily pour their bile especially on France".|$|E
60|$|I sat {{thinking}} of the pain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>chest,</b> and wishing I could remember hearing Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.|$|R
6000|$|But {{at the end}} of September, one mercilessly hot evening, he rose up in his {{bed with}} a little gasp, and said quickly to Reggie:--"Mr. Burke, I am going to die. I know it <b>in</b> myself. <b>My</b> <b>chest</b> is all hollow inside, and there's nothing to breathe with. To the best of my {{knowledge}} I have done nowt"--he was returning to the talk of his boyhood--"to lie heavy on my conscience. God be thanked, I have been preserved from the grosser forms of sin; and I counsel YOU, Mr. Burke [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the old pair entered the door. Zephaniah Pennel came and stood quietly by the pillow where the little form was laid, and lifted {{a corner of the}} blanket. The tiny head was turned to one side, showing the soft, warm cheek, and the little hand was holding tightly a morsel of the flannel blanket. He stood {{swallowing}} hard for a few moments. At last he said, with deep humility, to the wise and mighty woman who held her, [...] "I'll tell you what it is, Miss Roxy, I'll give all there is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old <b>chest</b> yonder if you'll only make her--live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} now, it's not worth splitting," [...] broke in Mac. [...] "I've cards <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> Why don't you {{play for the}} lump sum?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{round head}} pushed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> like a nut [...] in its socket, And I the swift bracts that sheathe it: those [...] breasts, those thighs and knees, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ere am I," [...] said Mr. Lister, good-naturedly {{helping him}} {{to cut a}} cabbage, [...] "at the age of sixty-two with a bank-book down below <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> with one hundered an' ninety pounds odd in it." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{good fortune}} would have it, {{the three men}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> party were not drinkers. Therefore I didn't drink save on rare {{occasions}} and disgracefully when with other men. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> personal medicine <b>chest</b> was a quart of whisky. I never drew the cork till six months afterward, in a lonely camp, where, without anaesthetics, a doctor was compelled to operate on a man. The doctor and the patient emptied my bottle between them and then proceeded to the operation.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of the ordeal, Robertson has said: [...] "I had {{coughing}} spasms so violent I feared I {{would lose}} my baby. I vomited after every spasm. I was incontinent after every spasm. I burst blood vessels <b>in</b> <b>my</b> eyes, strained muscles <b>in</b> <b>my</b> back and <b>chest,</b> and {{was unable to}} care for my two year old. [...] " [...] "Please make no mistake. This is a disease which can, and has, killed, and has left many who survive with permanent disabilities. Please, let’s all form a chain of protection and get vaccinated." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{started to}} obey, <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> {{swelling}} with pride <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mission, Jed Dunham cried {{out that he}} wanted to go with me. Jed was about my own age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in, doctor! Yes, I'm better. But there's a deal o' {{bubbling}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> It's {{all them}} toobes. If I could but cut the phlegm, I'd be right. Can't {{you give me}} something to cut the phlegm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, Ermine, I can't spend {{a winter}} in Scotland. A cold always makes the ball {{remind me of}} its {{presence}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> and I was told that if I spent a winter at home, it must be on the Devonshire coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{is nothing}} definite. That's the worst of it. You could fight it more easily if it was. It's just a dead, heavy {{depression}} here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and across my forehead. But do forgive me, dear girl! What a brute I am to shadow you like this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Then {{in order}} to test Lord Vishnu, Maharishi reached Vaikunth Dhama. He entered the Dhama without Lord Vishnu's {{permission}} and saw that the Lord was resting at that time. Maharishi asked him to wake up, but Lord was in deep sleep. On seeing no reaction from Lord, Maharishi hit Lord Vishnu on his chest. That strike by Maharishi Bhrigu left a foot print on Lord's chest and that foot print is known as [...] "Shri Vatsa". Lord Vishnu got up after the strike and realized what had happened. On realizing that Maharishi had hit him with his foot, Lord asked him, “Maharishi, are you hurt <b>in</b> your foot? <b>My</b> <b>chest</b> is strong but your foot is not so strong". Seeing the decorum of Lord Vishnu, Bhrigu was pleased and declared him superior amongst the Trideva.|$|R
2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mother’s <b>chest.</b> We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is when we saw the real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt they}} might do so. I will see, at any rate, if I can obtain some money from the {{political}} agents. I have next to nothing <b>in</b> <b>my</b> military <b>chest,</b> and our forces are at a standstill for the want of it. But that {{does not seem to}} matter. While our troops are ill-fed, ragged, almost shoeless, and unpaid, every Spanish or Portuguese rascal who holds out his hand can get it filled with gold. As to arms, they are in the first place wanted for the purpose of the Portuguese militia, who are likely to be a good deal more useful than these irregular bands; and in the second place, there are no means whatever of conveying even a hundred muskets, let alone the ten thousand that Romana is good enough to ask for. By the way, are you aware whether Sir John Moore intended the army to sail to England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is, - and I ask {{it with a}} {{fluttering}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> {{which actually}} extends to the soles of my feet, - that it may take place soon. Otherwise, I know {{it is one of}} those subjects I shall never hear the last of.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No such thing. I am {{much too}} {{delicate}} {{to make and}} keep such appointments in the winter season. If you knew what a pain I had <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> this morning, and how I went without breakfast, and was knocked down besides, you'd feel the impropriety of bringing me here in the snow. Come, I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are good}} enough things," [...] says she, [...] "though I have better <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> at home. It {{is a good}} enough cloak, and I am {{in need of a}} new cloak." [...] At that she fingered the scarlet, and the touch of the fine stuff went to her mind like singing. [...] "Come," [...] says she, [...] "if it were only for your civility in showing it, what will you have for your cloak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have seen}} it, felt it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth, my throat, <b>my</b> [...] <b>chest,</b> <b>my</b> belly, Burning of {{powerful}} salt, burning, eating through [...] my defenceless nakedness. I have been thrust into white, sharp crystals, Writhing, twisting, superpenetrated.|$|R
60|$|At {{this stage}} {{my body was}} all dead, so far as I was concerned, save my head and a little patch of <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> No longer did the pound and smash of my {{compressed}} heart echo <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brain. My heart was beating steadily but feebly. The joy of it, had I dared joy at such a moment, {{would have been the}} cessation of sensations.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} I would listen closely. <b>My</b> <b>chest</b> was tight, <b>my</b> mouth dry, the light dark to my eyes; {{the thought of}} the numbers that were soon to leap in upon us kept <b>my</b> heart <b>in</b> a flutter: and the sea, which I heard washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast ere morning, ran <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind strangely.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} be quite that. I left the brig {{absolutely}} without a cent, but foreseeing that necessity might make them of use, I borrowed {{half a dozen of}} the doubloons from the bag of Señor Montefalderon, and, fortunately, they are still in my pocket. All I am worth in the world is in a bag of half-eagles, rather more than a hundred altogether, which I left <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> in my own state-room aboard the brig." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{caught a}} second glimpse of things without, puffs of vapour, half liquid slush, excavated, sliding, falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness. I {{went down with}} Cavor's knees <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> Then he seemed to fly away from me, {{and for a moment}} I lay with all the breath out of my body staring upward. A {{toppling}} crag of the melting stuff had splashed over us, buried us, and now it thinned and boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on the glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, she'll enjoy {{punching}} {{your ears}} then. She's never so happy as when she's overhauling her fellow creatures and going for 'em with a knife,' answered Emil, undisturbed. 'I've {{got a lot}} of plunder for you fellows <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> but I knew I should have no peace till my cargo for the girls was unloaded. Now tell me all the news.' And, seated on Amy's best marbletopped table, the sailor swung his legs and talked at the rate of ten knots an hour, till Aunt Jo carried them all off to a grand family tea in honour of the Commodore.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stood there}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heavy coat and my poor {{battered}} shako, my chin upon <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> and <b>my</b> eyelids over my eyes. I had done my best, and I {{could do no}} more. It {{was the sound of}} horses' hoofs which made me at last raise my head, and there was the grey-moustached Governor of Dartmoor Prison not ten paces in front of me, with six mounted warders behind him! ...|$|R
60|$|She found great {{comfort and}} {{assurance}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> altered clothes--she liked the new fashions of dress, she alleged. It {{was not simply}} altered clothes. I did grow two inches, broaden some inches round <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> and increase <b>in</b> weight three stones before I was twenty-three. I wore a soft brown cloth and she would caress my sleeve and admire it greatly--she had the woman's sense of texture very strong in her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would thy {{occupation}} were ended, or thy neck broken, damned pander!" [...] said Anthony Foster. [...] "But I {{must follow}} his beck, for his interest and mine are the same, {{and he can}} wind the proud Earl to his will. Janet shall give me those pieces though; they shall be laid out in some way for God's service, and I will keep them separate <b>in</b> <b>my</b> strong <b>chest,</b> till I can fall upon a fitting employment for them. No contagious vapour shall breathe on Janet--she shall remain pure as a blessed spirit, were it but to pray God for her father. I need her prayers, for I am at a hard pass. Strange reports are abroad concerning my way of life. The congregation look cold on me, and when Master Holdforth spoke of hypocrites being like a whited sepulchre, which within was full of dead men's bones, methought he looked full at me. The Romish was a comfortable faith; Lambourne spoke true in that. A man had but to follow his thrift by such ways as offered--tell his beads, hear a mass, confess, and be absolved. These Puritans tread a harder and a rougher path; but I will try--I will read my Bible for an hour ere I again open mine iron chest." ...|$|R
60|$|However, as I had a {{great many}} very good clothes and linen in abundance, which I had ordered to be packed up in two great boxes, I had them shipped on board, not as my goods, but as {{consigned}} to my real name in Virginia; and had the bills of loading signed by a captain in my pocket; and in these boxes was my plate and watches, and everything of value except my money, which I kept by itself in a private drawer <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> {{which could not be}} found, or opened, if found, with splitting the chest to pieces.|$|E
60|$|I {{was short}} and broad-shouldered with large strong hands admirably adapted for this work, {{and for the first}} two hours, easily held my own {{with the rest of the}} crew, but as the morning wore on and the sun grew hotter, my enthusiasm waned. A painful void {{developed}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> My breakfast had been ample, but no mere stomachful of food could carry a growing boy through five hours of desperate toil. Along about a quarter to ten, I began to scan the field with anxious eye, longing to see Harriet and the promised luncheon basket.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a long, {{hard way}} to get out of the poor-farm and finance my miserable little, pitiful little, {{adventure}} of the Wide Awake. Do you know that I worked in the poor-farm laundry for two years, for one dollar and a half a week, with my one available hand and what little I could do with the other, sorting dirty clothes and folding sheets and pillow-slips until I thought a thousand times my poor old back would break in two, and until I knew a million times the location <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> of every fraction of an inch of my missing ribs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Returning as a three-year-old, she won first-up in a listed race by 4 lengths. Stepping up to Group 2 {{level in}} the Danehill Stakes at Flemington, she caused concern when she {{stumbled}} at the start; however, she recovered to keep her winning run going, beating the colt Wanted, by ¾ of a length. Moody, commenting on the mishap {{in the early stages}} said [...] "I certainly had <b>my</b> heart <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth". A <b>chest</b> muscle injury sustained in the start kept her out of racing until the following January. That resuming run saw her take on the older horses in the Group 2 Australia Stakes at Moonee Valley, where she won by 2½ lengths. Shortly after the race, the filly sustained an injury to a suspensory ligament in her right foreleg which kept her out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
