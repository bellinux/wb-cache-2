40|$|An {{introduction}} to hops is presented which includes {{an account of}} the morphology of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), and a brief history of the use of hops in the brewing of beer. The chemistry of the humulinic acids is outlined from the isolation of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acid</b> A to that of humulinic acids C md D. To achieve a rational synthesis of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acid</b> C, which was the main object of the study, it appeared that it would first be necessary to synthesise the tetrahydrofuran, ethyl 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxycarbonyl- 5 -tetrahydro-furylacetate. Two approaches were made to the synthesis of this vital intermediate. One involved incorporation of the 5, 5 -diester group into a reaction scheme before the tetrahydrofuran ring was formed, whilst the other, was to prepare a tetrahydrofuran with the 5 -position suitably disubstituted so that a further reaction would then afford the required intermediate. The former approach was unsuccessful while the latter was partially successful in that a number of 5, 5 -disubstituted 2, 2 -dimethyltetrahydrofurans were prepared. Attempts to convert 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxymethyl- 5 -ethoxy-ethyltetrahydrofuran to the required diester tetrahydrofuran were unsuccessful. <b>Humulinic</b> <b>acid</b> C was prepared by degradation of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acid</b> A which had been obtained from hop-oil humulone. Degradation of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acid</b> C' afforded ethyl 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxycarbonyltetrahydrofurylacetate which was then degraded two steps further to yield 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxyethyl- 5 -ethoxymethyltetrahydrofuran (which had also been prepared by a synthetic route). The p. m. r. spectra of the two compounds were the same confirming that they were identical in structure. Further suggestions for the synthesis of the diester tetrahydrofuran are also made...|$|E
40|$|Spoilage of beer by {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp.) has considerable economic significance. Compounds derived from the hop (Humulus lupulus) possess antibacterial activity but their role in prevention of beer spoilage has been disputed. Prior to the present study, the mechanism by which such compounds inhibited growth of beer-spoilage {{lactic acid bacteria}} was unknown. A range of hop compounds (colupulone, (-) -humulone, (-) -cohumulone) and hop-derived compounds (trans-isohumulone, trans-isocohumulone, trans-humulinic acid, dehydrated <b>humulinic</b> <b>acid)</b> was prepared and analysed using several spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR spectrometry; mass spectroscopy; 1 H-NMR f 13 C-NMR spectroscopy). The ability of these weak acids to ionise in solution was studied. The lack of agreement between pKa values measured using potentiometric, conductimetric, spectroscopic and solubility methods suggests that, in aqueous solution, the compounds formed covalent hydrates. Antibacterial activity of the compounds against Lactobacillus brevis IFO 3960 was pH-dependent: the undissociated form of each compound was the active antibacterial moiety and the ionised form had little activity. The antibacterial activity of the undissociated forms {{of each of the}} compounds was similar. In the case of the undissociated form of trans-isohumulone, 0. 1 - 0. 4 ptM was sufficient to inhibit growth of Lact. brevis IFO 3960 in a modified version of de Man Rogosa Sharpe medium over the pH range 4. 0 - 7. 0. Trans-isohumulone acted as an ionophore of the mobile-carrier type. In lactic acid bacteria, H + was exchanged for Mn 2 + in an electroneutral process that required the presence of a second monovalent cation (e. grK +, Na +) ...|$|E
40|$|High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used {{in the analysis of}} hop derived components in beer, but the scope of these methods is limited by the range of attainable reference compounds. The synthesis and purification of a range of relevant components has been described by several authors, but in our laboratory these procedures fail to give compounds of sufficient purity. Modification of published procedures are described for the preparation of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acids,</b> dehydrohumulinic acids, hulupones, and colupulone. These procedures provide facile routes for preparation of these compounds in higher yields than was hitherto reported, and also in sufficient purity for their use as standards in quantitative HPLC analysis. Although bitterness in beer is largely due to iso - a - acids, other compounds such as hulupones are considered to have similar bitter properties. Alternative routes to hulupones using the readily available and cheap 6 -acids extracts as starting material are therefore examined. Oxidation of Bacids in the presence of sodium sulphite was established as the most feasible route to these compounds. The structural authenticity of all preparations was confirmed by infra-red, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Purity of the compounds was established using HPLC in conjunction with photodiode array detection. Developed HPLC methods, and synthesised pure reference standards are used in the quantitative analysis of <b>humulinic</b> <b>acids</b> in hop iso-a-acid extracts before, and after acid hydrolysis. HPLC methods are also developed for the quantitative analysis of hulupone formed from the oxidation of B-acids solutions. The stability of all compounds synthesised was investigated so that satisfactory conditions for their long-term storage could be identified...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of iso-alpha-acids wasinvestigated at four pH levels between 4. 5 and 6. 5 at differentboiling temperatures (90 - 130 Â°C) during the wort boiling time(0 - 360 min). The free energy of activation {{and the reaction}} rateconstant (k) of the degradation of iso-alpha-acids werecalculated. Raising pH value from 4. 5 to 5. 5 and from 5. 5 to 6. 5 decreased the reaction energy about 20 kJ/mol. The relativeproportion of isocohumulone stays almost constant. Wedeveloped a kinetic model for the irreversible consecutivereation; iso-alpha-acids are isomerized form of alpha-acids bythe application of heat in solution {{and at the same}} timeiso-alpha-acids are degraded to <b>humulinic</b> <b>acids</b> and othercompounds. This kinetic model is useful to calculate time toadded hops into boiling kettle...|$|R
