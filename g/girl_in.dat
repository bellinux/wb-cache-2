Aim: To study differences in epidemiological profiles, perceptions, socio economic losses, and quality-of-life losses and management of dysmenorrhoea in different settings for effective management. Design and Setting: A comparative cross-sectional study among adolescent school <b>girls</b> (101 <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> urban areas and 79 <b>girls</b> <b>in</b> rural areas) {{in the district of}} Karimnagar.
