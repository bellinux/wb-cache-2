40|$|The {{emission}} distribution {{characteristics of}} an evaporation source {{can be used}} to define the correct geometry in the vacuum chamber for the production of uniform-thickness coatings. We first measured the thickness of coatings on test pieces positioned at known radial distances on a single rotation <b>flat</b> <b>rack</b> in the vacuum evaporation chamber and used these data in a computer program which found the source emission function, in the form cosQ φ, which provided the best fit to the data. φ is the emission angle of the evaporant stream from the source, measured from the vertical. The known emission function was then used to determine the source offset and calotte curvature which produced the best thickness uniformity over the diameter. In one example, we found Q = 1. 31 for Al 2 O 3 evaporated from an electron beam source. This enabled us to predict a chamber geometry which yielded coatings across a calotte of diameter 81 cm with a thickness variation of +/- 0. 3 %. For Si 02 Q = 1. 70, but the uniformity was less excellent (+/- 3 %) because this material is difficult to evaporate controllably. The technique is a powerful one for anyone setting up his coating chamber to produce a large number of coated substrates...|$|R

50|$|A micro {{data center}} (MDC) is a smaller or {{containerized}} (modular) data center architecture {{that is designed}} to solve different sets of problems that take different types of compute workload that does not require to traditional facilities. Whereas the size may vary from <b>rack</b> to <b>container,</b> a micro data center may include fewer than 4 servers in a single 19-inch rack. It may come with built-in security systems, cooling systems, and/or fire protection. Typically there are standalone rack-level systems containing all the components of a 'traditional' data center. including in rack cooling, power supply, power backup, security, fire and suppression. They could be rapidly deployed indoors or outdoors or also in rugged terrains.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} power-lean storage system, where racks of servers, or even entire data center {{shipping}} containers, can be powered down to save energy. We show that <b>racks</b> and <b>containers</b> {{are more than}} the sum of their servers, and demonstrate the feasibility of designing a storage system that powers them up and down on demand; further, we show that such a system would save an order of magnitude more energy than current disk-based power-proportional storage systems. Our simulation results using file system traces from the Internet Archive show over 44 % energy savings, a 5 x improvement over disk-based power management systems, without performance impact. We explore the tradeoffs in choosing the right unit to power off/on, and present an automated framework to compute the optimal power management unit for different scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{accounts}} for a significant fraction of the operational costs of a data center and data center owners are increasingly interested in moving towards power proportional designs. However, we show that current power proportional solutions are inherently limited in the energy savings they can offer; {{the reason is that}} they focus on managing the data center IT equipment (disks, servers) and neglect the large power overheads resulting from non-IT infrastructure such as cooling, and power distribution equipment. We propose a solution, where the power management unit is as large as a rack, or even an entire containerized data center. We show that it is practical today to design data centers to power down idle <b>racks</b> or <b>containers</b> – and in fact, current online service trends strongly enable this model. Finally, we show that energy savings increase by an order of magnitude with larger power management units, while performance remains unaffected. 1...|$|R

40|$|The load {{suspension}} device is for placing in storage <b>racks</b> storage <b>containers</b> which it grabs on the floor. Part {{of the load}} {{suspension device}} is located on a carriage which can be extended to either side, on which two chain drives are mounted, said chain drives guiding two carriers. For loading purposes, the carriage drives out until {{the ends of the}} chain drive are suituated at both sides of the storage container. As a result of the movement of the chains, the carriers are introduced in succession into transverse slots on the base of the storage container and the carriage is retracted so that the container is pulled onto the load suspension device. By suitably synchronizing the carrier and carriage movements, the minimum vertical spacing of the storage container is only limited by the thickness of the carrier. Several load suspension devices can be arranged in a stacked order to save space, whereby the resulting vertical pitch corresponds to that of the racks...|$|R
50|$|Modules are {{assembled}} into arrays on {{some kind}} of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For <b>flat</b> roofs, <b>racks,</b> bins and building integrated solutions are used. Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.|$|R
40|$|Infestation with mites {{may occur}} even in well kept laboratories. They proliferate in undessicated {{cultures}} Because they are tiny (~ 130 µ long), mites can crawl through cotton plugs and can enter covered petri dishes, carrying contaminating conidia from one culture to another. Purity of stocks is suspect {{by the time}} mites are detected. Seeing a mite with a belly full of orange conidia walking across an agar or glass surface under the microscopic is an alarming experience, signalling trouble and requiring interruption of other work while cleaning up is given top priority. Reasonable precautions can reduce the probability of infestation. At Stanford, we have reduced the frquency to less than once a decade. Effective measures have been devised {{for dealing with the}} problem when it does occur, but recovery from an infestation is laborious and requires prompt and vigorous action. Procedure Killing mites: Cultures and crosses that can be readily replaced should be autoclaved, together with exposed <b>racks</b> and <b>containers.</b> Cultures to be recovered can be freed of mites in either of two ways. Freezing at − 18 ºC or − 20 ºC for 24 hours kills both adults and eggs (Subden and Threlkeld 1966, Allison and Hilton 1994). (Refrigeration at 5 ºC slows mites but does not kill them.)

40|$|Are human {{abilities}} to control vehicles and other machines {{the same in}} space as those on Earth? The L- 10 Manual Control Experiment of the First Materials Processing Tests (FMPT) started from this question. Suppose a pilot has the task to align {{the head of a}} space vehicle toward a target. His actions are to look at the target, to determine the vehicle movement, and to operate the manipulator. If the activity of the nervous system were the same as on Earth, the movements, of the eye and hand would become excessive because the muscles do not have to oppose gravity. The timing and amount of movement must be arranged for appropriate actions. The sensation of motion would also be affected by the loss of gravity because the mechanism of the otolith, the major acceleration sensor, depends on gravity. The possible instability of the sensation of direction may cause mistakes in the direction of control of manipulator movement. Thus, the experimental data can be used for designing man-machine systems in space, as well as for investigation of physiological mechanisms. In this experiment, the direction of vehicle heading is expressed by a light spot on an array of light emitting diodes and the manipulator is of a finger stick type. As the light spot moves up and down, the Japanese Payload Specialist, and the subject, must move the manipulator forward and backward to keep the movement of the light spot within the neighborhood of the central point of the display. The position of the light spot is computed in such a manner that when the stick is kept at the neutral position, a motion whose acceleration is proportional to the angle of deflection is added to the movement of the light spot. The Operator Describing Function, which is an expression of human control characteristics, can be calculated from 2 minutes of raw data of the light spot position and stick deflection. The 2 minutes of operation is called a run, and 8 runs with resting periods composes a session. The on-orbit experiment will be conducted on the second, fourth, and seventh days. One session of experiment of each of these days is conducted following the L- 4 experiment, which uses the same apparatus. The Payload Specialist, aided by a Mission Specialist, will take our apparatus from a <b>rack</b> <b>container,</b> set up the apparatus, attach electrodes for measurements of eye movement and muscle activity, conduct the L- 4 Visual Stability Experiment, conduct one session of the manual control experiment, and then dissemble and stow the apparatus. In addition to the flight experiment, pre-flight and post-flight experiments will be conducted. The data of three sessions on orbit will reflect adaption of physiological systems to microgravity. The data of post-flight experiments, on the other hand, will reflect re-adaptation of physiological systems to the gravity condition on the ground. Control data collected with and without psychological tension will be scheduled just prior to and long before launch...|$|R
