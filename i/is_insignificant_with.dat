40|$|Aerobic {{oxidation}} {{is important}} in the cycling of methane in the sediments of Lake Washington. About half of the methane flux from depth is oxidized to CO, in the upper 0. 7 cm of the sediments and the remainder escapes into the water column. In terms of the total carbon budget of the lake, the upward flux of methane <b>is</b> <b>insignificant</b> <b>with</b> only about 2 % of the carbon fixed by primary production being returned as methane. The upward flux of methane, however, does represent about 20 % of the organic carbon decomposed within the sediments. In addition, methane oxidation consumes 7 - 10 % of the total oxygen flux into the sediments. Measured kinetic parameters suggest that methane oxidation is restricted to the top 6 - 7 mm of sediment where oxygen is present and that the rate of this process is probably controlled by the concentration of methane. As an end product in the degradation of organic carbon, methane is an important component in the carbon cycle of freshwater environments.

Specific as well as nonspecific binding is probed using polarized-light spectroscopy combined with singular value decomposition analysis. Circular and linear dichroism data confirm binding geometries consistent with minor groove binding for both of the ligands. Interestingly, at high and intermediate ligand/DNA ratios the polyamide exhibits no significant sequence discrimination between mixed-sequence (calf thymus) and AT DNA as compared to DST. Each ligand is concluded to exhibit two different binding modes depending upon ligand/DNA ratio and nucleo-base sequence. At high binding ratios, distinct differences between the ligands are observed: circular dichroism spectra exciton effects provide evidence of bimolecular interactions of the polyamide when bound to AT-DNA, whereas no effects are seen with DST or mixed-sequence DNA. Also linear dichroism indicates that a change in binding geometry occurs at high polyamide/AT ratios, and that the effect occurs only with polyamide in contrast to DST.

40|$|Background: Since the {{introduction}} of full field digital mammography (FFDM) {{a large number of}} UK breast cancer screening centers have reported blurred images, which can be caused by movement at the compression paddle during image acquisition. Purpose: To propose and investigate the use of position feedback from the breast side of the compression paddle to reduce the settling time of breast side motion. Method: Movement at the breast side of the paddle was measured using two calibrated linear potentiometers. A mathematical model for the compression paddle, machine drive and breast was developed using the paddle movement data. Simulation software was used to optimize the position feedback controller parameters for different machine drive time constants and simulate the potential performance of the proposed system. Results: The results obtained are based on simulation alone and indicate that closed-loop control of breast side paddle position dramatically reduced the settling time from over 90 seconds to less than 4 seconds. The effect of different machine drive time constants on the open-loop response <b>is</b> <b>insignificant.</b> <b>With</b> closed-loop control, the larger the time constant the longer the time required for the breast side motion to settle. Conclusions: Paddle motion induced blur could be significantly reduced by implementing the proposed closed-loop control...|$|E

GHG reduction potential depends on vehicle design, adoption, driving and charging patterns, charging infrastructure, and electricity generation mix.

Specifically, this study will examine environmental dimensions as a potentially important moderator of the association between TMT attributes and organizational growth.

40|$|This work reports an {{effective}} design of cache system for Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). It introduces built-in logic for verification of cache coherence in CMPs realizing directory based protocol. It is developed around the cellular automata (CA) machine, invented by John von Neumann in the 1950 s. A special class of CA referred to as single length cycle 2 -attractor cellular automata (TACA) has been planted to detect the inconsistencies in cache line states of processors’ private caches. The TACA module captures coherence status of the CMPs’ cache system and memorizes any inconsistent recording of the cache line states during the processors’ reference to a memory block. Theory has been developed to empower a TACA to analyse the cache state updates and then to settle to an attractor state indicating quick decision on a faulty recording of cache line status. The introduction of segmentation of the CMPs’ processor pool ensures a better efficiency, in determining the inconsistencies, by {{reducing the number of}} computation steps in the verification logic. The hardware requirement for the verification logic points {{to the fact that the}} overhead of proposed coherence verification module is much lesser than that of the conventional verification units and <b>is</b> <b>insignificant</b> <b>with</b> respect to the cost involved in CMPs’ cache system...|$|E
40|$|Forming {{of metal}} plates with a {{high-power}} laser beam is a flexible materials forming technique. Bending {{results from the}} establishment of a steep temperature gradient through the material thickness which leads to non-uniform thermal expansion/contraction and subsequently residual stresses. It is important to characterize these residual stresses as a function of process parameters such as line energy (LE) to optimize treatment conditions and to gain an insight into the mechanism of the formation of the final geometries. Non-destructive neutron diffraction measurements were carried out on ENGIN-X at ISIS and KOWARI at ANSTO to map the residual stress distribution around the heat affected zone (HAZ) of laser deformed mild steel plates for single and multiple passes as a function of line energy (LE), the primary laser forming process parameter. It was found that in the centre of the HAZ, longitudinal residual stresses are tensile and dominant, transverse stresses are predominantly tensile and normal stresses are compressive and close to zero. The residual strain in longitudinal direction increased with LE and number of passes until yielding. Even higher heat input decreased the magnitude of the cusp, but not its total height.
