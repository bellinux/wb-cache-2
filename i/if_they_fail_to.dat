5|$|Once {{a student}} has met the three course requirement, {{he or she}} is then {{eligible}} to formally apply to the ALM program. Typically applicants must submit a completed application, proof of an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent) plus transcripts, resume, two essays, and a nonrefundable application fee. Some programs require additional specific classes {{to be part of the}} initial three before formal admission. Students will be denied admission indefinitely <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> earn a grade of B after twice enrolling in the Proseminar course.|$|E
5|$|The parents {{care for}} young birds {{for two or}} three months after they fledge, but from August to November the juveniles {{disperse}} to find a territory of their own to occupy. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> find a vacant territory, they usually starve. The juvenile survival rate is unknown, but the annual survival rate for adults is 76.8%. The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild tawny owl, and of over 27years for a captive bird.|$|E

50|$|The trial {{involved}} {{four different}} treatment levels, and patients {{were encouraged to}} enter {{the next level of}} treatment <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> achieve remission or response (50% reduction in symptoms) after a specified number of weeks.|$|R
50|$|In this competition, players {{attempted}} to {{score on the}} opposing teams goalie. Players who scored earned a point for their team for each goal they scored. Players were eliminated from the competition <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> score.|$|R
5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{political}} institutions which hold {{the executive and}} legislative power of the Union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although {{the exact nature of}} this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> comply. According to the 2014 edition of The Official Directory of the European Union, women account for 33% of higher-ranking officials.|$|E

5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> detach in the neck.|$|E

5000|$|The third incentive, {{requiring}} {{states to}} [...] "take title" [...] and assume liability for waste generated within their borders <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> comply, {{was held to}} be impermissibly coercive and a threat to state sovereignty, thereby violating the Tenth Amendment.|$|R
50|$|Nash 1950 {{defines a}} {{classical}} bargaining problem {{as being a}} set of joint allocations of utility, some of which correspond to what the players would obtain <b>if</b> <b>they</b> reach an agreement, and another that represents what <b>they</b> would get <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|R
25|$|The Tonkawa hired {{legal counsel}} and claimed {{they had been}} {{pressured}} into signing the agreement, under the threat that all their allotments would be canceled <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> capitulate. <b>They</b> claimed they had demanded $1.25 per acre.

25|$|In 2013, {{a person}} filed lèse-majesté charges against his brother, showing how easily the lèse-majesté law can be misused {{and that the}} law {{has now become a}} {{potential}} weapon in family feuds. Often the police, courts, and prosecutors are afraid they will be accused of disloyalty to the monarch <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> prosecute allegations of lèse-majesté.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{found in}} the club a partly burned {{document}} that supports the version according to that, {{on the evening of}} 30 October, patrons have rented the club to Goodbye to Gravity band. The rental agreement stipulated that Goodbye to Gravity had to pay a rent of 500 euros <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> bring to the concert at least 400 people, in which case the consumption from the bar would have been sufficient to cover the costs.|$|E
50|$|By the way, in the U.S.A., {{parents might}} {{be liable for}} the acts of their child <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> their parent’s authority, if the minor is {{involved}} in a gang offense for example. In the U.S.A., juveniles don’t have the right to bail.|$|R
50|$|In the final, {{round the}} winning {{contestant}} had to match {{seven of the}} eight punchlines correctly to win the star prize but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> do so, <b>they</b> went away with the prize that corresponded to how many correct punchlines they had matched.|$|R

25|$|After notices are served, the {{prosecutor}} may ask {{the court to}} keep the accused in jail (remanded) or released on bail. Otherwise, the accused is released on their own recognizance (ROR'd). If the accused is released, the accused must appear in court every time their case is calendared (scheduled for a court hearing), and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> appear the judge may forfeit their bail and issue a bench warrant for their arrest, although judges may excuse defendants from having {{to show up at}} every court appearance.|$|E
25|$|People are slotted into {{functions}} {{insofar as}} they have characteristics which are at least compatible with the functions. They always have a choice in how they perform their role and how they act it out, {{but they have no}} choice about taking it on. If they succeed in their role, they can advance their position or career, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> live up to it, they are demoted or fired. Human individuality is then conceptualized in terms of the relationship between buyer and seller.|$|E
25|$|But in function, the Australian Parliament {{follows the}} Westminster system. The Prime Minister holds office {{because they can}} command {{the support of the}} {{majority}} of the House of Representatives, and must resign or advise an immediate election if the house passes a vote of no-confidence in their administration. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> do so, they risk dismissal by the Governor-General. All ministers are required to be members of Parliament (although the Constitution permits a person who is not currently a member of parliament to hold a ministerial portfolio for a maximum period of three months).|$|E
50|$|Other sources {{imply that}} the sons of Boreas died chasing the harpies, as it was fated that <b>they</b> would perish <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> catch those <b>they</b> pursued. In some versions, the harpies drop into the sea from exhaustion, and so their pursuers fall as well.|$|R
50|$|Victor {{also has}} a council who obey him entirely. In Fantastic Four #536 in 2006, he killed his own Prime Minister for {{claiming}} control of Latveria in his absence, and threatened to kill two other ministers <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> find the landing spot of Thor's hammer.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of these}} public work {{projects}} were accomplished {{with the help}} of forced labour, referred to as [...] "Political Labour". Village Heads were paid 10 shillings for conscripts, and fined £50 <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> supply. Individuals could be fined or jailed for refusing to comply.|$|R
25|$|In competition, divers {{must submit}} their lists beforehand, and once past a {{deadline}} (usually when {{the event is}} announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).|$|E
25|$|The 32 {{teams in}} the tournament are, partly based on {{geographical}} location, divided into four divisions: the West Division, the North Division, the South Division, and the East Division. Each division consists of 8 teams who will play a round-robin in their division, with an extra game against a local rival in their division, giving a total of 8 games per team. Each team is assigned four home games as well as four road games. The top two teams of each division qualify for the playoffs; however, should Slovan Bratislava and/or Vienna Capitals qualify for the playoffs as hosts (<b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> reach {{one of the top}} two spots of the South Division), they will replace the worst second ranked team(s) out of all four divisions.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{schools are}} divided into three types - gymnasiums, {{professional}} and craft schools. After graduating from the primary school, students take a test called Matura. The test covers subjects that were taught in primary school. They are awarded the maximum of 40 points at the test. They also get points from their average marks from 5th to 8th grade, and the maximum is 60 points. Both the points from Matura and from average marks are totallized into the maximum of 100 points. Then, students {{make a list of}} their preferred schools and are sorted according to how much points they had gained - every secondary school has a limited number of students it takes. After students make lists for preferred schools, they get into the first school that suits them according to the points. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> get into any of the schools they had listed (ex. if they don't have enough points, but they had chosen very competitive schools), they make another list for the Second Enrollment Deadline.|$|E
50|$|Mayer's temper {{was widely}} known, {{but most people}} knew that his sudden bursts of anger faded quickly. With those working {{underneath}} him, he was usually patient and preferred to leave department heads alone, and would fire executives <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> produce successful films over a long period.|$|R
50|$|The various tests {{formulated}} {{by the courts}} were not rules of law, and nor were they exhaustive. They were simply useful practical guidelines and, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> provide a satisfactory answer, the matter was correctly left to the common sense, wisdom, experience and sense of fairness of the court.|$|R
50|$|On February 15, 1989, {{before the}} start of Georgetown's home game against Boston College, Thompson walked off the Capital Centre floor and turned {{coaching}} duties over to assistant Mike Riley.
