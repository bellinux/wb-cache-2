5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> estimated that over 15 million people died.

Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.|$|E
5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process and the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E

Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a group that includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E

5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words {{it makes the}} world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality {{of their lives and}} the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than}} the competitive.|$|E

5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of.

5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

The gold precipitates out of solution as a sludge, and is filtered off and melted.|$|E
