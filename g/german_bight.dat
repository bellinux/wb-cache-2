40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2180 on 28. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) Observational {{studies have been}} undertaken in the southern North Sea with the aims of describing the seasonal cycle of suspended sediments in three dimensions, and comparing the results with other measured physical and biological parameters in order to investigate some of the processes that control the distribution and transport of suspended sediments in shelf seas. A systematic investigation of the horizontal and vertical suspended sediment distributions, and the inorganic and organic components, {{over a period of}} fifteen months, has described major features, including a high turbidity region off the East Anglian coast, low turbidity regions in the northern and central parts of the southern North Sea, and the seasonal development of a plume emanating from the East Anglian coast, and high organic matter contents along the coasts of the Southern and <b>German</b> <b>Bights.</b> Comparison with coincident measurements of salinity, temperature, river discharge, chlorophyll and phytoplankton productivity indicated that the suspended sediment distributions were strongly influenced by water mass interactions, haline and thermal stratification and primary production. The distribution of water masses accounted for the basic division between the turbid coastal waters and the relatively clear offshore waters of Atlantic origin. Density differences tended to trap sediment in coastal waters, and were also responsible for localised suspended matter minima at periods of high river discharge. Primary production was 2 - 3 times greater in the eastern half of the southern North Sea than the western half, and consequently suspended sediment distributions in the English coastal waters were dominated by an inorganic component and in continental European coastal waters by an organic component. Fluxes of suspended sediment were calculated within the plume. The total annual flux was estimated to be 6. 6 Mt a-' ± 50 %. This flux was compared with sediment budgets for the coast of eastern England. Only one of the budgets provided enough material to supply the plume. Errors in the flux and budget calculations suggested that more data were required before the results could be accepted unequivocally. These results provide important qualitative and quantitative information on North Sea suspended sediment distributions and transport. The data can be used for validating mathematical models of suspended sediment transport and for improving interpretation methods of remote sensing imagery. They provide a valuable baseline study for future research programmes such as the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS). Plymouth Marine Laboratory and Proudman Oceanographic Laborator...|$|R

5|$|Another fleet advance {{followed}} on 18–20 October, {{though it}} ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, Kaiser {{took part in}} an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. On 1 December, the High Seas Fleet was reorganized; Kaiser and her sisters were transferred to the newly created IV Battle Squadron, with Kaiser as the flagship. In 1917, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was reinstated; the surface units of the German navy were therefore tasked with covering the departures and arrivals of the U-boats.

During October, Kaiser Wilhelm II conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December.

40|$|The Belcolour- 1 {{database}} holds {{more than}} 4 years of uniformly resampled MERIS chlorophyll (CHL), total suspended matter (TSM), MODIS-AQUA CHL, TSM and sea surface temperature (SST) over the North Sea. A {{first step of}} the RECOLOUR* project consists in the univariate reconstruction of missing data with the DINEOF method (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions). In particular, the DINEOF treatment of MERIS CHL and TSM images available for the year 2003 allowed an efficient synthesis of the coherent modes of variability existing at {{the scale of the}} whole North Sea. For both parameters, 4 modes were retained by general cross validation as an optimum for the reconstruction of missing data. For CHL, the first spatial mode shows the high influence of coastal nutrients outputs (mainly continental estuaries and diffused coastal sources) and the lower concentration in the well stratified central and northern part of the North Sea compared to the southern bight and the eastern English Channel. The spatial trends described by the first mode are permanent features during the year, although slightly enhanced during the summer and reduced during winter. The second spatial mode correspond to the main algal blooming events (spring and autumn) with increased concentrations in the whole southern bight of the north sea, around the Isle of Wight and in frontal alike structure north-west from Denmark. The third Eofs describes well the dynamics of an early phytoplankton bloom occurring in march along the Norwegian coast, where a strong stratification induced by an output of cold water from Baltic Sea provides good light conditions to phytoplankton. Concerning TSM, the first spatial mode shows the dominant influence of large estuaries and of resuspension from shallow coastal sedimental plains. The patterns suggest a general transport of sediments from south-east England up to the northern Dutch coastal waters, as a clear distinction between the stratified northern part and the well mixed and charged southern and <b>German</b> <b>bights.</b> Although these trends are permanent during the year, the range of the spatial variations are slightly reduced during the summer, following the reduction of resuspension, of total sediment outputed by rivers and of advection along continental coasts. The second mode shows a clear seasonal signal. The winter influence of the second spatial mode can be understood as general sediment enrichment due to higher resuspension, but a clear influence of intense winter terrestrial water outflows leading to lower sediment concentration in the plumes then in the surrounding waters. This is clear for the Elbe river discharge, the whole natural part of the Wadden Sea and the Seine river plume. The Scheelde and Thames rather seems to be just neutralizing the seasonal TSM resuspension signal. The Rhine river discharge seems to make exception as no influence is detected in the second spatial mode. During summer, the contribution of the second EOF is reversed with a general reduction of suspended matter concentration in most part of the area but some local sediment enrichment at specific river discharges. Original MERIS CHL and TSM images were filled and reconstructions were produced at a daily interval based on a linear interpolation of the temporal modes. From this, weekly averages could be calculated at stations such as the turbidity maximum of the Scheelde river plume, showing the onset of the spring bloom co-occurring with a period characterised both by the TSM seasonal reduction and by important TSM temporal variability...|$|R
40|$|Las playas del sur de Buenos Aires son dominantemente mesomareales. La acción de la marea aumenta hacia el {{interior}} de lo que se ha denominado Rincón de Bahía Blanca y condiciona la distribución de las formas estuariales: barreras e islas de barrera hacia el exterior, y planicies, marismas y estuarios dominados por el reflujo hacia el interior. La morfodinámica de las playas reflejan estos condicionamientos dinámicos, y al mismo tiempo que son regulados por el tipo de sedimento disponible: arenas finas hacia el exterior y fangos hacia el interior del Rincón; las gravas están limitadas a los lugares donde las playas actuales están retrabajando playas fósiles. Dentro de este patrón sencillo, debemos considerar los procesos de crecimiento y retrabajo de lóbulos deltaicos del Río Colorado. El objetivo del presente trabajo consistióee en analizar la tipología de playas en un sector de transición entre ambientes micro y mesomareales, así como desarrollar una descripción de la morfología, sedimentos y parámetros físicos para inferir patrones de transporte de sedimento. Para ello se emplearon perfiles topográficos, muestreos sedimentológicos y mediciones de altura de ola. A partir de los datos de marea se calcularon los parámetros morfodinámicos RTR y Ù. De acuerdo al rango de mareas, la costa del llamado Rincón de Bahía Blanca es mesomareal en su interior y micromareal hacia sectores de mar abierto. Dentro del Rincón dominan los procesos y formas mareales (planicies, marismas, canales) que retrabajarron abanicos deltaicos del río Colorado. La energía de las olas y procesos de deriva en los sectores más oceánicos (este y sur del Rincón), generaron geoformas de acantilados, plataformas de abrasión, islas de barrera y médanos colgados. Beaches {{from southern}} Buenos Aires are dominantly mesotidal. Tidal range increases toward {{the interior of}} the Rincón de Bahía Blanca and conditions coastal landforms. Barriers and barrier islands dominate toward the outer bay; tidal flats and marshes toward the inner bay. These effects of the tidal range on coastal landforms are similar to those described at the Georgia and <b>German</b> <b>bights</b> (Hubbard et al., 1979; Nichols and Allen, 1982). Beach morphodynamics also reflects this situation although it is also conditioned by the type of available sediments: sands (dominantly fine sand) toward the outer bay and mud toward {{the interior of the}} Rincón. Gravel is limited to the southern beaches where present processes are reworking Holocene beaches, thatbeaches, which are the reworking of pedimentation levels. Within this pattern, the processes of growth and reworking (during Upper-Pleistocene and Mid-Holocene stillstands) of the deltaic lobes of the Colorado River should be considered. At the beaches of the south, there is a littoral sand contribution derived from the Negro River assymetricasymmetric delta. Toward the north, this longshore drift is segmented by ebb-dominated mesotidal inlets. Aeolian sand corridors, driven from the Colorado valley, have also transported sandsized material toward the coast. Open-ocean beaches (Segunda Barranca Lighthouse, El Cóndor Village and La Chiquita Beach) behave as mesotidal with dominant wave effects from the Atlantic Ocean. Along- bay beaches (San Blas Bay and Los Pocitos Beach) the effect of the tide dominates over fetch-limited waves. LonshoreLongshore-drift transport is significant at the coast between the Negro River Inlet and San Blas Bay. Northwards, the longshore drift is segmented by the ebb-oriented tidal inlets of the San Blas, Anegada, Brightman, Falsa and Verde bays. Fine sand dominates at these beaches, although shell accumulations at the backshore and gravel-composed washovers denote the effects of episodic open-ocean storms. The aim of the present paper focused to analyze beach typology in a transitional area: micro and mesotidal regimes; wave-dominated to tide-dominated continental shelf. Beach morphology and physical parameters were also considered to recognized sediment- transport patterns. With this purpose, topographic surveys, grain-size analysis y and breaker-height measurements were performed, in order to calculate the morphodynamic parameters RTR and Ù. In regard to tidal ranges, the coast of the Rincón de Bahía Blanca is mesotidal towards the interior and microtidal to the Outer Bayoffshore. Within the Inner Bay, tidal processes have reworked past delta fans of the Colorado River into tidal flats, marshes and tidal channels. At the Outer Bay, wave energy and the longshore drift toward the north generated barriers and ebb-dominated tidal deltas where there was sand availability, and cliffs, abrassionabrasion platforms and cliff-top dunes where sand or gravel were scarce...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} long-term {{spatial variability}} {{in a number}} of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the northeast Atlantic and North Sea using data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Over the last four decades, some dinoflagellate taxa showed pronounced variation in the south and east of the North Sea, with the most significant increases being restricted to the adjacent waters off Norway. There was also a general decrease along the eastern coast of the United Kingdom. The most prominent feature in the interannual bloom frequencies over the last four decades was the anomalously high values recorded in the late 1980 s in the northern and central North Sea areas. The only mesoscale area in the northeast Atlantic to show a significant increase in bloom formation over the last decade was the Norwegian coastal region. The changing spatial patterns of HAB taxa and the frequency of bloom formation are discussed in relation to regional climate change, in particular, changes in temperature, salinity, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Areas highly vulnerable to the effects of regional climate change on HABs are Norwegian coastal waters and the Skagerrak.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Niobe was recommissioned for coastal defense, stationed in the <b>German</b> <b>Bight.</b> Between 28 August to 2 September, and from 23 December, Niobes commander also served as {{the commander of the}} torpedo-boat flotillas defending the Jade Bight and the mouth of the Weser. She was removed from front-line service on 5 September 1915, and her crew was reduced four days later. The commander of the torpedo-boat flotillas returned to Niobe on 14 January 1916, as his previous flagship, the old coastal defense ship , was decommissioned. Niobe nevertheless remained in service with a reduced crew. Kommodore (Commodore) Ludwig von Reuter, the commander of the IV Scouting Group, and his staff briefly used Niobe as a headquarters ship, from 6 June to 3 July. Starting on 20 August, she became the headquarters ship for now-Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) von Hipper, the commander of the I Scouting Group.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{stopped in}} Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, {{where it was}} greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Karl der Grosse and the main German fleet was {{anchored}} at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the growing Anglo-German naval arms race. As {{a result of the}} British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers (6 to 13 September) were shortened considerably, consisting only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the <b>German</b> <b>Bight,</b> and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In November, the I Squadron cruised in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{base for}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea was Wilhelmshaven {{on the western side}} of the Jade Bight; the port of Cuxhaven, located on the mouth of the Elbe, was also a major base in the North Sea. The island of Heligoland {{provided}} a fortified forward position in the <b>German</b> <b>Bight.</b> Kiel was the most important base in the Baltic, which supported the forward bases at Pillau and Danzig. The Kaiser Wilhelm Canal through Schleswig-Holstein connected the Baltic and North Seas and allowed the German Navy to quickly shift naval forces between the two seas. In peacetime, all ships on active duty in the High Seas Fleet were stationed in Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, or Danzig. Germany possessed only one major overseas base, at Kiautschou in China, where the East Asia Squadron was stationed.|$|E

5|$|While {{disorder}} {{consumed the}} bulk of the fleet, Kommodore Andreas Michelsen organized a group to attack any British attempt {{to take advantage of the}} fleet's disarray. He pieced together a group of around sixty ships, including Königsberg and several other light cruisers. On 9 November, reports of British activity in the <b>German</b> <b>Bight</b> prompted Königsberg and several destroyers to make a sweep. After the reports proved false, the flotilla returned to Borkum, where they learned of the Kaiser's abdication. Following the Armistice that ended the fighting, Königsberg took Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer to Scapa Flow to negotiate with Admiral David Beatty, the commander of the Grand Fleet, for the place of internment of the German fleet. The ship arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 November, flying a white flag. The accepted arrangement was for the High Seas Fleet to meet the combined Allied fleet in the North Sea and proceed to the Firth of Forth before transferring to Scapa Flow, where they would be interned.|$|E
