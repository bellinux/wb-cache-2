Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to <b>individuals</b> <b>or</b> to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness.

Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic <b>individuals</b> <b>or</b> present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
