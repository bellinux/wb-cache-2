40|$|Background: Measurements of the <b>ft</b> <b>values</b> for T= 1 / 2 mirror β+ decays offer {{a method}} to test the conserved vector current {{hypothesis}} and to determine Vud, the up-down matrix element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.

Bidirectional (buccolingual and mesiodistal) radiographs were acquired from each root. The voids along the root filling were assessed.
