40|$|PURPOSE: Subdural {{placement}} of an epidural catheter is rare {{and difficult to}} detect. Electrical stimulation of the epidural space can be useful to detect such an event. The {{purpose of the present}} case report is to confirm the efficacy of electrical stimulation to detect a subdural {{placement of}} an epidural catheter and to illustrate this unusual positioning by computed tomography (CT) scan images. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 51 -yr-old man was scheduled for an aorto-iliac bypass on a combined epidural and general anesthesia technique. Electrical epidural stimulation was used. A very low threshold of 0. 3 mA was observed with diffuse response movement at T 3 and at T 10, without cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> on catheter aspiration. An injection of 12 mL of 2 % lidocaine with epinephrine 1 / 200, 000 produced signs of iv injection of local anesthetic and an extensive block. Subdural placement of the catheter, suspected by the low current threshold response to epidural catheter stimulation, was confirmed by CT scan imaging. CONCLUSION: The present case report confirms that electrical stimulation of the epidural space is useful to detect misplacement of epidural catheter such as a subdural placement.

40|$|Producing {{cost-competitive}} {{small and}} medium-sized solar cooling systems is currently a significant challenge. Due to system complexity, extensive engineering, design and equipment costs; the installation costs of solar thermal cooling systems are prohibitively high. In efforts to overcome these limitations, a novel sorption heat pump module has been developed and directly integrated into a solar thermal collector. The module comprises a fully encapsulated sorption tube containing hygroscopic salt sorbent and water as a refrigerant, sealed under vacuum with no moving parts. A 5. 6 m 2 aperture area outdoor laboratory-scale system of sorption module integrated solar collectors was installed in Stockholm, Sweden and evaluated under constant re-cooling and chilled <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> temperatures {{in order to assess}} collector performance. Measured average solar cooling COP was 0. 19 with average cooling powers between 120 and 200 Wm- 2 collector aperture area. It was observed that average collector cooling power is constant at daily insolation levels above 3. 6 kWhm- 2 with the cooling energy produced being proportional to solar insolation. For full evaluation of an integrated sorption collector solar heating and cooling system, under the umbrella of a European Union project for technological innovation, a 180 m 2 large-scale demonstration system has been installed in Karlstad, Sweden. Results from the installation commissioned in summer 2014 with non-optimised control strategies showed average electrical COP of 10. 6 and average cooling powers between 140 and 250 Wm- 2 collector aperture area.

40|$|Patients with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) who {{rock for}} 1 â 2 hr {{per day in}} a rocking chair {{demonstrate}} signif-icant improvements in depression, anxiety, and bal-ance and a decrease in pain medication usage; however, the underlying basis for their responses remains unclear. Rocking with plantar flexion uses the calf muscles, enhancing lower limb <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> to the heart, which should increase blood pressure (BP) and may, then, also increase cerebral perfusion. Accordingly, we tested the efficacy of rocking activity for increasing BP in healthy, older persons. In a pilot laboratory study of 24 healthy, White men and women aged 55 â 87 years, we observed that 30 min of steady rocking led to an average 12 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP, p <. 001) and a 3. 6 mmHg average increase in diastolic blood pres-sure (DBP, p <. 001). To determine the effect of using this intervention in a nonclinical setting, we tested a similar group of 7 participants at a senior center. In this setting, we observed an average increase in SBP of 27 mmHg (p <. 001) and in DBP of 2. 5 mmHg (p <. 001) after 30 min of rocking. In a subgroup (n 8) of hypotensive individuals (SBP < 110 mmHg after sitting quietly for 30 min) extracted from both settings, rocking raised the average SBP from < 100 mmHg to approximately 120 mmHg. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that rocking can increase BP and, therefore, may enhance cerebral perfusion. This observation may play a fundamental role in designing nursing interventions focused on improvement of symptoms associated with AD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{interpretation}} of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid results {{is dependent on}} the availability of reference values for healthy individuals. Only a few studies have published such reference values and the applicability of results is restricted by small sample sizes and the limited representativeness of the study population. We aim to investigate the influence of age, gender, collection site and season on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid results and to establish reference values for use in clinical practice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid data from 295 healthy never-smoking volunteers, investigated during 1990 - 2009, were analyzed retrospectively. 47 volunteers had 2 - 5 repeat lavages during the course of several years. Fluid recovery, total number of cells, cell concentration, and differential cell counts on cytospin prepared slides were recorded. Reference values, as represented by the 5 (th) to the 95 (th) percentile, were 72 - 96 % for macrophages, 2 - 26 % for lymphocytes, 0 - 4 % for neutrophils and 0 - 1 % for eosinophils. Basophils and mast cells were rare. When repeat lavages were performed, there was a relatively large intra-individual variability, mainly for macrophages and lymphocytes. An age dependent decrease of lavage <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> was present, but there was no age dependent correlation with any of the other BALF parameters. The BALF cell parameters were independent of gender, season and site (lingula vs. middle lobe). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell differential count is independent of age, gender, season and collection site (RML or lingua). It therefore seems acceptable to use the same reference values for all never-smoking individuals...|$|E
30|$|Disease states {{associated}} with inflammation like trauma, burns, sepsis, and acute pancreatitis {{are characterized by}} a marked reduction in the vascular endothelial glycocalyx [45]-[47]. The glycocalyx is the primary structure limiting free fluid flux across the vascular space [35]. Furthermore, if tissue injury also occurs, as often {{is the case in}} acute lung injury, vascular endothelial tight junction disruption will also occur in areas typically relatively resistant to fluid translocation, markedly opening up the interstitium to fluid translocation resulting in further imbalance between the intravascular and extravascular fluid and local interstitial edema [48]. Since different vascular regions of the body allow proteins to pass through the capillary membrane at different rates, as exemplified by the loose barrier in the liver and tight barrier in the brain, interstitial edema formation is not usually uniform throughout the body. Many of the plasma proteins in patients experiencing acute systemic inflammation will be cytokines and protein-bound hormones. Thus, the metabolic effect of differentially altered permeability and plasma leak {{may play a role in}} the regional expression of a generalized inflammatory response. Since most, if not all, <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> from the extravascular space to the vasculature happens via lymphatic drainage [49], if transcapillary leakage is increased, the lymphatic system may become overwhelmed, further contributing to the development of edema and a relative intravascular volume deficit despite no actual loss of fluid outside the body. This fluid flux imbalance is accentuated further by slower lymphatic flow resulting from immobility in bedridden patients. Accumulation of intravascular fluid in the interstitial space is therefore dependent on multiple factors described in the Starling force equation above, permeability of the vascular membrane, as well as the capacity of the lymphatic system [50].|$|E

40|$|SINDA/FLUINT {{has been}} found to be a {{versatile}} code for modeling aerospace systems involving single or two-phase fluid flow and all modes of heat transfer. Several applications of SINDA/FLUINT are described in this paper. SINDA/FLUINT is being used extensively to model the single phase water loops and the two-phase ammonia loops of the Space Station Freedom active thermal control system (ATCS). These models range from large integrated system models with multiple submodels to very detailed subsystem models. An integrated Space Station ATCS model has been created with ten submodels representing five water loops, three ammonia loops, a Freon loop and a thermal submodel representing the air loop. The model, which has approximately 800 FLUINT lumps and 300 thermal nodes, is used to determine the interaction between the multiple fluid loops which comprise the Space Station ATCS. Several detailed models of the flow-through radiator subsystem of the Space Station ATCS have been developed. One model, which has approximately 70 FLUINT lumps and 340 thermal nodes, provides a representation of the ATCS low temperature radiator array with two fluid loops connected only by conduction through the radiator face sheet. The detailed models are used to determine parameters such as radiator <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> temperature, fin efficiency, flow distribution and total heat rejection for the baseline design as well as proposed alternate designs. SINDA/FLUINT has also been used as a design tool for several systems using pressurized gasses. One model examined the pressurization and depressurization of the Space Station airlock under a variety of operating conditions including convection with the side walls and internal cooling. Another model predicted the performance of a new generation of manned maneuvering units. This model included high pressure gas depressurization, internal heat transfer and supersonic thruster equations.

40|$|Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) {{have the}} {{potential}} to supply a significant fraction of the low-temperature (< 125 Â°C) thermal energy used in the United States, and Geothermal District Heating (GDH) networks provide the primary means for distributing and selling that energy. To encourage wider discourse about utilization of low-temperature geothermal resources, the potential for EGS district heating in the U. S. states of New York and Pennsylvania was evaluated. Opportunities were evaluated on two levels. First, geographic locations and towns with the most promise for GDH were identified as the best communities for initial feasibility studies and future GDH deployment. Second, factors contributing most to the cost of EGS district heating were identified as possible targets for research and development (R&R) efforts. In order to evaluate these opportunities, a model was developed to simulate an EGS district heating system at every population center within the study region. Incorporating an updated geothermal gradient map, buildings and energy census data, an EGS district heating model, and investment and operation and maintenance costs, a unique levelized cost of heat (LCOH) from GDH was estimated for each community. These LCOHs were compiled into a supply curve and used as the primary metric with which to compare GDH systems across the region and identify the most promising communities in which to focus initial GDH efforts. An analysis of the sensitivity of the LCOH to various model inputs provided a means to identify the factors with the most influence on LCOH and thus pinpoint the most effective technology components to target with research and development efforts {{in order to reduce the}} cost of GDH and increase its ability to compete with more traditional heating methods. Further, three separate technology cases were evaluated in order to investigate the capabilities of EGS district heating given both the state of the technology today and its potential in the future given improvements to EGS technology. It was found that EGS district heating certainly has the potential to supply clean, reliable, costeffective energy for space and water heating for New York and Pennsylvania in the near future. However, modest improvements in EGS technology, escalation of current natural gas prices, or some form of government incentive will likely be required before GDH is able to compete with other heating alternatives today on purely economic grounds. EGS reservoir flow rates, drilling costs, system lifetimes, and <b>fluid</b> <b>return</b> temperatures have significant effects on the LCOH of GDH and thus will likely provide the highest return on R&D investment. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|E
30|$|Inflow and outflow fluid {{monitoring}} {{involves the}} calculation of the volume infused in the uterine cavity and the <b>fluid</b> <b>returned</b> from the outflow channel of the hysteroscope and the fluid leaking through the cervix.

In a closed system the <b>fluid</b> is <b>returned</b> through suction to a reservoir. This set up also improves visibility by removing debris and blood from the endometrial cavity. However, even with suction, there is still fluid escaping through the cervix and the perineum. To overcome this problem drapes with a fluid reservoir for collection of fluid should be used.

50|$|The key to {{the torque}} converter's ability to {{multiply}} torque lies in the stator. In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the <b>fluid</b> flow <b>returning</b> from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat. Under the same condition in a torque converter, the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> will be redirected by the stator so that it aids {{the rotation of the}} impeller, instead of impeding it. The result is that much of the energy in the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover. This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque. Since the <b>returning</b> <b>fluid</b> is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counter-rotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the one-way stator clutch.|$|R
