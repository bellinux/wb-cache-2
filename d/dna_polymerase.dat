5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's.

These remarkable enzymes synthesize polynucleotide chains {{based on the}} complementarity of an incoming nucleotide to an existing <b>DNA</b> template. <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are grouped into six families (A, B, C, D, X, and Y). The previous SnapShot (<b>DNA</b> <b>Polymerases</b> I Prokaryotes) described the structural and functional characteristics conserved across the families, using the <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> from the bacterium Escherichia coli as an example. In this SnapShot, we now highlight <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> from humans (Homo sapiens) {{and their relationship to}} human diseases.

40|$|We {{have very}} {{recently}} highlighted possible connections between <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> the main enzymes in the DNA metabolism, and human diseases (Ramadan, K., Maga, G. and Hübscher, U. : <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> and diseases, In: Genome Integrity: Facets and Perspectives ed. Lankenau, D. -H. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg Germany, Vol 1, pp. 69 - 102, 2007). Beside {{a role in}} DNA replication of the genome <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have fundamental functions in other aspect of DNA metabolism, such as DNA repair, DNA recombination, translesion DNA synthesis and cell cycle checkpoint. In the last decade many novel <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have been identified, but their exact cellular functions still await clarification. We know that many <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have redundant functions. It {{is a fact that}} specific inhibition of certain <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> is a promising approach to develop anticancer drugs. In this review we will concentrate on DNA repair proteins and translesion <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> as possible targets for anti cancer drugs...|$|R
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase.</b> This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E
40|$|Two <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{that can}} copy {{synthetic}} RNA polymers {{are present in}} human tissue culture cells. These enzymes which have each been purified about 500 -fold, are present in both HeLa cells, which are derived from a cervical carcinoma, and in WI- 38 cells, a normal diploid strain originating from human embryonic lung tissue. These synthetic RNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are identified by their ability to copy efficiently the ribo strand of synthetic oligonucleotide-homopolymer complexes, and differ in this respect from the known DNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> found in HeLa cells. The template requirements of these new <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> resemble that of the RNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> of the RNA tumor-viruses...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{major role}} {{of various types}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> is genome replication. However, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are also {{necessary}} to establish the accuracy, efficiency of replication, repairing process, and consequently decrease in mutations induced by DNA-damaging agents. Cancer initiation is usually associated with induction of mutations in specific oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes by endogenous or exogenous genotoxic agents. Various point mutations occurring in cancer cells arise from error-generating activities of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> Published data show that decrease in the accuracy of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> without affecting their activity, could be the causative agents of tumors. It has also been reported in literature that the expression of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> is altered in human cancers compared to normal tissue. In this review, we discuss some evidences {{of the role of}} various <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> in cancer development. The results of this study showed that lack of proper activity of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> causes tumors through {{increase in the number of}} generated mutations in the genome. Attitude towards the function of these enzymes can result in new achievements for cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase.</b> The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
50|$|During <b>DNA</b> synthesis, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> must select against ribonucleotides, {{present at}} much higher levels {{compared}} with deoxyribonucleotides. It {{is crucial that}} there is selectivity as DNA replication has to be accurate to maintain the organism's genome. It {{has been shown that}} the active sites of Y-family <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are responsible for maintaining a high selectivity against ribonucleotides. Most <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are also equipped to exclude ribonucleotides from their active site through a bulky side chain residue that can sterically block the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring. However, many nuclear replicative and repair <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> incorporate ribonucleotides into DNA, suggesting that the exclusion mechanism is not perfect.|$|R
40|$|During cell division, {{replication}} of the genomic DNA is performed by high-fidelity <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> but these error-free enzymes can not synthesize across damaged <b>DNA.</b> Specialized <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> so called <b>DNA</b> translesion synthesis <b>polymerases</b> (TLS polymerases), can replicate damaged DNA thereby avoiding replication fork breakdown and subsequent chromosomal instability...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} recently {{in the study of}} polymerases. First came the realization that there are many more <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> than originally thought; indeed, no fewer than 14 template-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> are found in mammals. Concurrent structural studies of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> bound to <b>DNA</b> and incoming nucleotide have revealed how these remarkable copying machines select the correct deoxynucleoside triphosphate among a sea of nucleotides. A whole new level of insight into DNA replication fidelity has been reached as a result of recently determined crystal structures of DNA lesions {{in the context of the}} active sites of repair, replicative and specialized <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> These structures illustrate why some lesions can be bypassed readily, whereas others are strong blocks to DNA replication...|$|R
50|$|During <b>DNA</b> replication, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> {{elongate}} new {{strands of}} DNA against complementary template strands. Most <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> comprise two different enzymatic domains: a polymerase and a proofreading exonuclease. The polymerase elongates the new strand in the 5' → 3' direction. The exonuclease removes erroneous nucleotides {{from the same}} strand in the 3’ → 5’ direction. This exonuclease activity is essential for a <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase's</b> ability to proofread.

25|$|In biochemistry, {{a reverse}} transcriptase, {{also known as}} RNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> is a <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> enzyme that transcribes {{single-stranded}} RNA into double-stranded DNA.

25|$|Following {{creation}} of RNA primers by primase on the lagging strand, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> δ synthesizes Okazaki fragments. <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> δ also carries out a 3' to 5' exonuclease role, proofreading newly synthesized DNA strands during DNA replication. When the polymerase encounters an erroneous base pair, it removes {{one of the}} nucleotides and replaces it with a correct one. A third function of <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> δ is to supplement FEN1/RAD27 5' Flap Endonuclease activity. This includes preventing and removing the strand displacement of 5' flaps, and creating ligatable nicks at the border of Okazaki fragments.|$|E
50|$|Its active metabolite, {{cidofovir}} diphosphate, inhibits {{viral replication}} by selectively inhibiting viral <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> It also inhibits human polymerases but this action is 8-600 times weaker than its actions on viral <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases.</b> It also incorporates itself into viral DNA hence inhibiting viral DNA synthesis during reproduction.|$|R

In the last few years, {{a large number of}} novel <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have been discovered, and the biochemical analysis of their properties has revealed a long list of intriguing features. Some of these polymerases have a very low fidelity and have been suggested to play mutator roles in different processes, like translesion synthesis or somatic hypermutation.

25|$|In {{virus species}} with reverse {{transcriptase}} lacking DNA-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> activity, creation of double-stranded DNA {{can possibly be}} done by host-encoded <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.|$|E
25|$|For lytic {{replication}} to occur, the {{viral genome}} must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, {{so it must}} linearize {{in the process of}} lytic reactivation. During lytic replication, viral <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> is responsible for copying the viral genome. This contrasts with latency, in which host cell <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> copies the viral genome.|$|E
25|$|Almost all PCR {{applications}} {{employ a}} heat-stable <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally {{isolated from the}} thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we would}} like to {{highlight}} the possible connections between <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> the main enzymes in DNA metabolism, and human diseases, also critically evaluating those cases where the experimental data are not fully convincing. To this aim, we will first give a short overview of the three main DNA metabolic events, namely replication, repair and recombination, {{as well as of the}} checkpoint pathways acting in response to DNA damage. Besides a role in replication of the genome, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> also have fundamental functions in other aspects of DNA metabolism, such as DNA repair, DNA recombination, translesion DNA synthesis and cell cycle checkpoint.

This is the first demonstration of such role of aphidicolin in the eukaryotic DNA replication...|$|R
50|$|In DNA replication, {{the leading}} DNA strand is {{continuously}} extended {{in the direction}} of replication fork movement; whereas, the DNA lagging strand runs discontinuously in the opposite direction as Okazaki fragments. <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> also cannot initiate DNA chains so they must be initiated by short RNA or DNA segments known as primers. In order for DNA polymerization to take place, two requirements must be met. First of all, all <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> must have both a template strand and a primer strand. Unlike RNA, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> cannot synthesize <b>DNA</b> from a template strand. Synthesis must be initiated by a short RNA segment, known as RNA primase, in the 5' to 3' direction.This synthesis occurs by the addition of a dNTP to the 3' hydroxyl group {{at the end of the}} DNA strand. Secondly, <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> can only add new nucleotides to the preexisting strand through hydrogen bonding. Since all <b>DNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> have a similar structure, they all share a two-metal ion-catalyzed polymerase mechanism. One of the metal ions attacks the primer 3' hydroxyl group of the dNTP. The second metal ion will stabilize the oxygen's negative charge.|$|R
