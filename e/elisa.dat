5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, <b>Elisa</b> (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which <b>Elisa</b> gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and <b>Elisa</b> are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though <b>Elisa</b> tells the son that his story is not true. As <b>Elisa</b> distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with <b>Elisa</b> to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (<b>ELISA)</b> to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial <b>ELISA</b> are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive <b>ELISA</b> result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by <b>ELISA</b> and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend <b>Elisa</b> (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, <b>Elisa</b> tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, <b>Elisa</b> becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (<b>ELISAs)</b> for antigen {{detection}} and blocking <b>ELISAs</b> for serum antibody rises were {{developed for the}} Snow Mountain and Norwalk agents of viral gastroenteritis.

Double antibody sandwich <b>ELISAs</b> {{for the detection of}} CPV-, CCV- and rotavirus antigens in fecal samples were also developed. Both the serological and antigen-detection <b>ELISAs</b> were used to screen samples from dogs in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea.

40|$|A {{ring trial}} was {{organized}} to evaluate Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) <b>ELISAs</b> by European laboratories. A total of five <b>ELISAs,</b> {{two of which}} specific for IgM antibodies, were evaluated by six participants. Sera were derived from cattle or sheep and originated from either a RVFV endemic area, a RVFV-free area or from experimental infection studies. Cohen's kappa analysis showed higher than 90 % agreement of two commercially available <b>ELISAs</b> with the virus neutralization test, suggesting that primary screening as well as serological confirmation using these <b>ELISAs</b> is feasible. More extensive validations with sera of known IgM status are, however, required to determine agreement between IgM <b>ELISAs.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on <b>Elisa,</b> calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but <b>Elisa</b> was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} <b>Elisa</b> remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E

5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the <b>ELISA</b> (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The <b>ELISA</b> test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive <b>ELISA</b> are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and <b>Elisa</b> sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing <b>Elisa.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Action of 24 March 1811 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, fought {{as part of the}} Royal Navy blockade of the French English Channel ports. By 1811, Royal Navy control of the French coast was so entrenched that French ships were unable to travel safely even in French territorial waters. In late 1810, French frigates <b>Elisa</b> and Amazone sailed from Le Havre to join with a larger squadron at Cherbourg, but were intercepted by a British frigate squadron and forced to shelter at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. There they came under sustained attack and <b>Elisa</b> was destroyed, Amazone successfully slipping back to Le Havre under cover of darkness.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Various {{countries}} require {{blood donor}} screening using assays applying specific HTLV-I and HTLV-II antigens. We evaluated the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of 4 anti-HTLV-I + II <b>ELISAs</b> (Abbott, Murex, Organon Teknika and Ortho). METHODS: Panel A consisted of HTLV-I-positive individuals (n = 41), panel B of Mixed Titer Performance Panel 204 (Boston Biomedica Inc. panels C and D of dilution series from HTLV-I-positive (n= 30) and HTLV-II-positive (n = 20) individuals and panel E of sera from first-time blood donors (n = 1, 055). RESULTS: In HTLV-I- and -II-positive samples, a sensitivity of 100 % could be observed in all 4 <b>ELISAs.</b> In diluted HTLV-I- and -II-positive samples, probit analysis revealed that the Murex assay had the highest analytical sensitivity, followed by the <b>ELISAs</b> from Ortho, Abbott and Organon Teknika. In specimens from first-time donors, a specificity of 100 % was observed in <b>ELISAs</b> from Murex, Organon Teknika and Ortho, and of 99. 7 % in the assay from Abbott.
