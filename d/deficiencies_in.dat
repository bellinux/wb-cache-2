40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} probability, period of development and characteristics of a clinical course of chronic prostatitis {{against the background of}} androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male. Materials and methods: The Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) rating scale has been applied for androgen deficiency evaluation and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) — for chronic prostatitis evaluation. 57 men with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male have been examined. Results: It has been concluded that the development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male occurs in a shorter time period and about 1. 5 times more frequently compared to androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male at the background of chronic prostatitis. The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male and androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male symptoms against the background of chronic prostatitis showed that androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis. The development of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male against the background of chronic prostatitis has showed a backward tendency. Signs of chronic prostatitis have been more frequently occurred in a period of four-five years earlier the androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male development. Conclusion: The risk of development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male during the next two years is actually four times higher in comparison with the development of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male against the background of chronic prostatitis. According to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patients with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> the aging male showed higher degree of severity than patients with isolated development of chronic prostatitis...|$|R

As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
