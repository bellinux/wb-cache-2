5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> the {{amendments}} were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the {{ownership}} {{group of the}} Canucks, now owned by Francesco Aquilini, announced they were considering purchasing the Hornets. In December 2010, the Hornets were bought by the league, and there was potential for relocation due to the club's financial difficulties. However, a Hornets move was effectively taken off the table in 2012 when Tom Benson, a New Orleans native who already owned the NFL's New Orleans Saints, purchased the team. One year later, Aquilini denied rumours {{that he wanted to}} purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family. Aquilini <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> while Rogers Arena is ready for basketball, having the NBA in Vancouver comes down to market support, which his company assesses to see if it has improved since the Grizzlies left.|$|E

5|$|On December 11, 2004, he {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title, beating former world champion Randall Bailey by knockout {{in the sixth}} round, {{as part of the}} Vitali Klitschko-Danny Williams undercard in Las Vegas. Cotto's performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in his face that opened cuts over and under both of his eyes. As a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> he didn't want to continue and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004 the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico's fighter of the year for 2004.|$|E

Nine media witnesses were allowed to record the actual event. Actor and activist Mike Farrell appeared as a commentator for the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the death penalty. Elliott King, the uncle of Charla King, was the sole member of the victim's family to arrive as a witness and <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> he had no sympathy for Taylor.

All casualties were from the initial attack on the Volcano border post. Later, Major General Abbas <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> it was beyond comprehension why the NATO forces returned to attack the second time.|$|E

5|$|Stephanie Brown {{became the}} {{featured}} {{character of the}} Batgirl series from 2009 to 2011. DC subsequently relaunched all their monthly publications during The New 52 relaunch. In the revised continuity, Barbara Gordon recovers from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and stars in the relaunched Batgirl series as the titular character. These changes were retained {{as part of the}} 2016 DC Rebirth event. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character's popularity from adaptations factored into the decision to have her return to the comics, and Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics, <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> she is the best-known version of the character.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act's major {{effect was}} the {{opposite}} of what was intended. In the years before the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding. Additionally, {{by the end of the}} war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate, and harming the rebuilding of English racing. There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the General Stud Book.|$|E

The Malaysian-based company’s managing director Datuk Jared Lim revealed that they planned to expand the brand throughout South East Asia, but <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> Hi-5's presence in Australia would remain intact. Former series producer Julie Greene took on the role as executive creative director and Lim became the brand's chairman. The Hi-5 brand was consolidated under new platform Tremendous Entertainment Group (TEG) in 2014, following Asiasons privatising and rebranding as Tremendous Asia Partners (TAP).|$|E

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
5|$|Billy Talent II hit {{the shelves}} on June 27, 2006. It fared {{very well in}} Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed {{significant}} success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, {{and was one of}} the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> they know they are a new band there, and they are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{have been}} <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> {{the use of}} explicit-constant {{definitions}} of the unit being defined that {{are not related to}} an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> using {{parliamentary}} debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. The suit is functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's features include a system that purifies air, powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The armor offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise <b>expressed</b> <b>that</b> {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E
