40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown the usefulness of using collective user interaction data (e. g., query logs) to recommend query modification suggestions <b>for</b> <b>Intranet</b> search. However, most of the query suggestion approaches <b>for</b> <b>Intranet</b> search follow an "one size fits all" strategy, whereby different users who submit an identical query would get the same query suggestion list. This is problematic, as even with the same query, different users may have different topics of interest, which may change over time {{in response to the}} user's interaction with the system. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a personalised query suggestion framework <b>for</b> <b>Intranet</b> search. For each search session, we construct two temporal user profiles: a click user profile using the user's clicked documents and a query user profile using the user's submitted queries. We then use the two profiles to re-rank the non-personalised query suggestion list returned by a state-of-the-art query suggestion method <b>for</b> <b>Intranet</b> search. Experimental results on a large-scale query logs collection show that our personalised framework significantly improves the quality of suggested queries...|$|E

Independent consultants in the assessment of organisational intranets often perform heuristic appraisal, a common method of usability evaluation. However, there are alternative usability models that offer valuable analysis in the evaluation process. Using a government organisation’s intranet as a case study, this paper assesses the value of an independent heuristic-based intranet audit by providing a comparable approach to assessment realisable internally in the organisation using questionnaires. Using a single case study, we empirically apply the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), together with some heuristic aspects, to provide an alternative tool <b>for</b> <b>intranet</b> usability and acceptance. We provide insight into the usability impact of intranet design changes, and compare the findings of an external usability audit with the approach outlined.

The thesis contains {{a detailed description of the}} rapid prototyping process model, as well as the modifications required to adapt the process <b>for</b> <b>Intranet</b> development. Further, it describes the gathering of system requirements using the results of several structured walk throughs. It also describes, in detail, the development efforts to address each of the requirements identified. The prototype developed as part of this thesis demonstrates several key aspects of Intranet development and deployment. For example, it incorporates webpage development using commercial off the shelf products common to the division, and the development of interactive functions with spreadsheet and database programs.

This paper provides findings from two interpretive case studies that illustrate how corporate intranets can be dynamically interwoven with other knowledge technologies in socio-technical networks (STNs) to integrate distributed formal and infonnal knowledge. A key finding suggests that businesses should carefully examine employee use of <b>intranets</b> <b>for</b> dynamic knowledge integration, and any implications stemming from this new integrative role <b>for</b> <b>intranets.</b> The paper also provides a theoretical framework for dynamic knowledge integration in STNs, which can underpin future research in this area. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} the key factors {{to be considered in}} intranet migration, and to investigate how the migration process differs from the first time intranet implementation. The aim was to compare the key factors of both processes, and study whether using SharePoint as the tool <b>for</b> <b>intranet</b> management affects these factors. First, a framework <b>for</b> <b>intranet</b> implementation key factors was created based on earlier research, and the findings were used as guidance in studying an intranet migration project at Royal Philips. The study was conducted in the Procurement function, and the data for the research was collected from an intranet migration project within the function. The results show that while many of the key factors in intranet migration are similar to the key factors of first time intranet implementation, there are also differences. Similarities include the importance of considering management and control mechanisms, top management support, and content, while differences could be seen in training, communication, and roles required in the process. A new important factor found in the migration project concerns the process of analyzing the existing intranet and identifying possible problems areas, so that the new intranet can be planned in a way that avoids them...|$|E

The Internet {{can be considered a}} vast (global) database, but whose unstructured format frequently leads to a feeling of being “lost in hyperspace”. Visualising this structure can make browsing a more productive endeavour. In this paper we introduce a means of “lossy ” translation from HTML to VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). This allows for the generation of a virtual world containing the structure with some content information about the site. This implements a new metaphor <b>for</b> <b>intranet</b> and internet browsing. ...|$|E
