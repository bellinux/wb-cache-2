In this review, recent findings on preferred geometries and interaction energies of these molecules are presented. Benzene and pyridine were used as model systems for studying aromatic and heteroaromatic molecules, respectively. Searches of Cambridge Structural Database show that both aromatic and heteroaromatic molecules prefer interacting at large <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements,</b> even though previous calculations showed that stacking interactions (with offsets of about 1. 5 Å) are the strongest.

40|$|Abstract:Studies of GPS data {{carried out}} {{before and after}} the great Wenchuan {{earthquake}} of Ms 8. 0 on May 12, 2008 show that anomalous crustal movements occurred before the earthquake. Data from 4 pre-earthquake observation sessions at a dense network of stations show that there were prominent broad-ranged long- and mid-term anomalies in <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements</b> and strain and in vertical displacements. Data from the fewer-numbered reference stations of continuous GPS observations since 1999 in West and South China showed short-term preseismic anomalies in <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements.</b> The detection of co-seismic <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements</b> at these stations supports the existence of the pre-earthquake anomalies. Results of single-epoch solutions of data from continuous-observation stations near the epicenter also show large imminent anomalies in vertical displacements. Although the Wenchuan earthquake was not predicted, these results give a strong indication that GPS should be the main observation technique for long-term, mid-term, short-term and imminent earthquake predictions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{main reason}} for the {{generation}} of tsunamis is the deformation of {{the bottom of the}} ocean caused by an underwater earthquake. Usually, only the vertical bottom motion is taken into account while the <b>horizontal</b> co-seismic <b>displacements</b> are neglected in the absence of landslides. In the present study we propose a methodology based on the well-known Okada solution to reconstruct in more details all components of the bottom coseismic displacements. Then, the sea-bed motion is coupled with a three-dimensional weakly nonlinear water wave solver which allows us to simulate a tsunami wave generation. We pay special attention to the evolution of kinetic and potential energies of the resulting wave while the contribution of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements</b> into wave energy balance is also quantified. Such contribution of <b>horizontal</b> <b>displacements</b> to the tsunami generation has not been discussed before, and it is different from the existing approaches.
