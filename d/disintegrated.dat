Formulation of a orally <b>disintegrating</b> dosage form is beneficial for patients suffering from motion sickness, repeated emesis, mental disorder and dysphasia because they cannot swallow large quantity of water and it is easy to administer. The unique property of orally <b>disintegrating</b> dosage form is that they are readily <b>disintegrating</b> and dissolves in saliva and avoids the requirement of water which is the major benefit over conventional dosage form. Further, drug having the satisfactory absorption from the oral mucosa can be formulated in such type of dosage form.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{efficiency}} of powdered corncob as a tablet <b>disintegrating</b> agent {{was compared to}} that of a number of wood products and to starch, the most popular agent used today.

The optimum particle size, at which powdered corncob produced its best <b>disintegrating</b> activity, was found to be about No. 40 mesh size U. S. P. The tablet <b>disintegrating</b> action of corn- cob and starch in tablets containing some partially or fully insoluble materials such as acetysalicylic acid, calcium carbonate, and sulfadiazine was tested. Corncob proved to be superior to starch in all these tests. The three layers of corncob were separated and tested individually for their tablet <b>disintegrating</b> action. The pith portion showed superior results over the other two layers. The possible role of starch and/or cellulose in the tablet <b>disintegrating</b> activity of corncob was examined.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{tendency}} toward innovative drug delivery systems has majorly increased attempts to ensure efficacy, safety and patient acceptability. As discovery and development of new chemical agents is a complex, expensive and time consuming process, so recent trends are shifting toward designing and developing innovative drug delivery systems for existing drugs. Out of those, drug delivery system being very eminent among pediatrics and geriatrics is orally <b>disintegrating</b> films (ODFs). These fast <b>disintegrating</b> films have superiority over fast <b>disintegrating</b> tablets as the latter {{are associated with the}} risks of choking and friability. This drug delivery system has numerous advantages over conventional fast <b>disintegrating</b> tablets as they can be used for dysphasic and schizophrenic patients and are taken without water due to their ability to <b>disintegrate</b> within a few seconds releasing medication in mouth. Various approaches are employed for formulating ODFs and among which solvent casting and spraying methods are frequently used. Generally, hydrophilic polymers along with other excipients are used for preparing ODFs which allow films to <b>disintegrate</b> quickly releasing incorporated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) within seconds. Orally <b>disintegrating</b> films have potential for business and market exploitation because of their myriad of benefits over orally <b>disintegrating</b> tablets.

40|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} the Hipparcos {{catalogue}} have revealed associations that are best explained as <b>disintegrating</b> multiple systems, presumably resulting from a dynamical encounter between single/multiple systems in the field (Li et al. 2009).

We will present here the methods/techniques {{that can be used}} to search for and identify <b>disintegrating</b> benchmark systems in three database/catalogues: Dwarf Archive, the Hipparcos Main Catalogue, and the Gliese-Jahreiß Catalogue. Placing distance constraints on objects with parallax or colour-magnitude information from spectrophotometry allowed us to identify common distance associations. Proper motion measurements allowed us to separate common proper motion multiples from our sample of <b>disintegrating</b> candidates. Moreover, proper motion and positional information allowed us to select candidate systems based on relative component positions that were tracked back and projected forward through time.
