5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E
5|$|Despite massive {{flooding}} and damage to entire neighborhoods, {{there were no}} drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> in Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2billion (2001USD, $6billion 2007USD) throughout Texas.|$|E
5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at right angles (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditching</b> {{or water}} landing, podded engines {{hanging from the}} wing {{increase}} the stress on the wing by {{increasing the amount of}} drag caused by the water. This can cause the wings to shear off or flip the aircraft and destroy the fuselage as happened to Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961.|$|R

40|$|Given {{here are}} results of tests made in calm water at various landing attitudes, speeds, and {{simulated}} conditions of damage. It {{was concluded that}} the best ditching could be made by contacting the water as near the stall angle as possible without losing adequate control. The landing flaps should be full down. If the paratainer hatch and aft-cargo doors fail as expected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditching,</b> {{there will be a}} large inrush of water into the cargo compartment which makes this location <b>a</b> very hazardous <b>ditching</b> station. The airplane will settle in the water rapidly {{to the level of the}} wings with only gradual changes in attitude. The maximum longitudinal deceleration will be between 1. 2 g and 1. 7 g <b>in</b> <b>a</b> calm-water <b>ditching...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a temporary bridge across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get across and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{then had}} stints working for KDNT in Denton, Texas, KCUL and KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted The Western Express, taught Sunday school {{and he played}} in nightclubs. He then {{decided to move to}} San Diego. He was unable to find a job, and decided to go to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, he slept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E

5000|$|The British Museum and Suffolk County Council funded {{excavation}} {{of the site}} between 14-15 October 2008, {{and found that the}} hoard had been buried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditched</b> enclosure, possibly <b>a</b> [...] "rectilinear religious enclosure". During this excavation, 42 further coins were discovered, making a total of 824 at that time. Analysis of the surrounding area, including intersecting ditches, dated the burial of the hoard at around 15 AD, which was concurrent with the minting of the latest coin found.|$|R
5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which ended up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He {{was taken to the}} North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of his right eye, and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, {{sustained}} winds reached , shattering plate-glass {{windows and}} interrupting electrical and telegraph services. The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm also downed power lines, telephone wires, and trees, and destroyed car garages. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. In Pompano Beach, the recently constructed Pompano Theater was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug store, and {{a grocery store}} also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. A freight train was blown off its tracks. An eight year old boy drowned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> near where his family sought refugee, while 51 additional people were injured throughout Broward County.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{fled from}} the field of battle, but was {{captured}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset). Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor, Therefore, no trial was needed before his execution. Despite begging for mercy and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.|$|E

5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} {{itself to a}} purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests {{that he could not}} be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E
5|$|Walsh {{was born}} in West Hoboken, New Jersey, which merged with Union Hill to become Union City in 1925. He joined the Civilian Military Training Corps at age 16, and the New Jersey Army National Guard in 1928. After graduating from Rutgers Law School, Walsh joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1934. Later that year, he {{discovered}} the body of gangster Baby Face Nelson, who died of injuries sustained in a gun battle with the police in Barrington, Illinois on November 27, 1934. Nelson had killed two FBI agents prior to fleeing the scene, wounded, and later died at his wife's side. The FBI, unaware of Nelson's death, continued a broad search for him, which included several home raids, {{through the night and}} into the following day. The search was not called off until a tip led them to Nelson's body, which was lying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> in what is now Skokie, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|In Miami, {{damage was}} minimal, limited to broken windows and awnings. In Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, windows and roofs were damaged, {{although}} damage was still fairly minor. Numerous {{power lines and}} telephone wires were downed in the latter. Northward, from Pompano Beach to Jupiter, buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10ft (3m) storm surge. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. An eight-year-old boy drowned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> near where his family sought refuge. In Boca Raton, two garages and several houses were destroyed. At the Cloister Inn, windows were shattered and the roof was damaged; across the street, 32freight cars belonging to a train along the Florida East Coast Railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch. A short distance to the north, a warehouse was flattened. A building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened. In Delray Beach, four churches suffered severe damage and the Alta Repp and Seacrest hotels both lost {{a portion of their}} roof. The police reported three deaths within the city. In Delray Beach and Lantana, all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged. In Boynton Beach, about 75% of businesses suffered complete destruction. Fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school.|$|E
