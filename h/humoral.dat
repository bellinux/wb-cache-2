5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of <b>humoral</b> {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of <b>humoral</b> immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen (2nd century AD), whose treatises included one On Barley Soup. Views on nutrition were influenced by schools of thought such as <b>humoral</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} shown in 1948 by Astrid Fagraeus in her {{doctoral}} thesis that the plasma B cells are specifically involved in antibody production. The role of lymphocytes in mediating both cell-mediated and <b>humoral</b> responses was demonstrated by James Gowans in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} the {{adaptive}} immune system are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. B cells {{are involved in the}} <b>humoral</b> immune response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune response.|$|E
5|$|Until this time, cell-mediated {{immunity}} and <b>humoral</b> immunity {{were considered to}} be contending theories to explain effective immune response, but the former lagged behind owing to lack of advanced techniques. Cell-mediated immunity got an impetus in its recognition and study when in 1942, Merrill Chase successfully transferred immunity against tuberculosis between pigs by transferring white blood cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as <b>humoral</b> immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called <b>humoral</b> immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} <b>humoral</b> immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based <b>humoral</b> response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of <b>humoral</b> medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids also {{suppress}} the <b>humoral</b> immunity, thereby causing a <b>humoral</b> immune deficiency. Glucocorticoids cause B cells to express smaller amounts of IL-2 and of IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clone expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also cause fewer T lymphocyte cells to be activated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} {{remnants}} {{of the theory of}} the four humors in the current medical language. For example, modern medicine refers to <b>humoral</b> immunity or <b>humoral</b> regulation when describing substances such as hormones and antibodies that circulate throughout the body. It also uses the term blood dyscrasia to refer to any blood disease or abnormality.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive {{immunity}} {{can also}} be divided {{by the type of}} immune mediators involved; <b>humoral</b> immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by secreted antibodies, whereas cell mediated immunity involves T-lymphocytes alone. <b>Humoral</b> immunity is called active when the organism generates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred between individuals or species. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the organisms’ own T-cells are stimulated, and passive when T cells come from another organism.|$|E
25|$|Through the neo-classical {{revival in}} Europe, the humor theory {{dominated}} medical practice, {{and the theory}} of <b>humoral</b> types made periodic appearances in drama.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>humoral</b> {{rejection}} and chronic disfunction {{occurs when the}} recipient's anti-HLA antibodies form directed at HLA molecules present on endothelial cells of the transplanted tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humoral</b> and cell-mediated immune {{responses}} limit malaria parasite multiplication, {{and many}} cytokines {{contribute to the}} pathogenesis of malaria {{as well as to}} the resolution of infections.|$|E
25|$|Here, subtypes are denoted {{according}} to their hemagglutinin (H or HA) and neuraminidase (N or NA) genes, which as surface proteins, act as the primary targets for the <b>humoral</b> immune response.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, the <b>humoral</b> {{theory of}} melancholia was {{increasingly}} challenged by mechanical and electrical explanations; references to dark and gloomy states {{gave way to}} ideas of slowed circulation and depleted energy.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal immunity, which {{includes}} immune {{function in the}} female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as <b>humoral</b> immunity. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were {{not found in the}} monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from <b>humoral</b> immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.|$|E
25|$|The strongest ODN in {{this class}} have three 6mer sequences. B ODN have been studied {{extensively}} as therapeutic agents because {{of their ability to}} induce a strong <b>humoral</b> immune response, making them ideal as a vaccine adjuvant.|$|E
25|$|Galen's <b>humoral</b> {{theories}} were {{influential in}} Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering {{was attributed to}} imbalances of the four bodily humors—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. <b>Humoral</b> manipulation {{continued to be a}} dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, {{decreasing}} the function and/or numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both B cells and T cells), monocytes, macrophages, and the anatomical barrier {{function of the}} skin. This suppression, if large enough, can cause manifestations of immunodeficiency, including T cell deficiency, <b>humoral</b> immune deficiency and neutropenia.|$|E
25|$|Since SS is {{associated}} with a high prevalence in women, sex hormones, especially estrogen, are believed to affect <b>humoral</b> and cell-mediated immune responses affecting susceptibility to the syndrome. Androgens are generally considered to prevent autoimmunity. Studies on mice models suggest estrogen deficiency stimulates presentation of autoantigens, inducing SS-like symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The bursa of fabricius, {{also known}} as the cloacal bursa, is a lymphoid organ which aids in the {{production}} of B lymphocytes during <b>humoral</b> immunity. The bursa of fabricius is present during juvenile stages but curls up, and in the sparrow is not visible after the sparrow reaches sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|In general, co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such {{as various}} interleukins, tumor {{necrosis}} factor, and GM-CSF) plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease <b>humoral</b> responses and increase cytotoxic responses (more important in viral protection). Co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1, B7-2 and CD40L are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Lipostatic {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{holds that}} adipose tissue produces a <b>humoral</b> signal that is proportionate {{to the amount}} of fat and acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output. It has been evident that a hormone leptin acts on the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase energy output.|$|E
25|$|Sex hormones seem to {{influence}} <b>humoral</b> and cell-mediated immune response, with estrogen being {{considered one of}} the biggest factors responsible for sex-immunologic dimorphism. Estrogen deficiency appears {{to play a role in}} development of SS. It has been hypothesized that androgen administration to the ocular surface may serve as an effective therapy for dry eyes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>humoral</b> {{immunity}} instigated by {{infection with}} the wild type {{is thought to}} be a very common event. The associated neutralising activity limits the usefulness of the most commonly used serotype AAV2 in certain applications. Accordingly, the majority of clinical trials currently under way involve delivery of AAV2 into the brain, a relatively immunologically privileged organ. In the brain, AAV2 is strongly neuron-specific.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, von Euler and Axelrod {{were two}} of three winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, “for their discoveries {{concerning}} the <b>humoral</b> transmittors in the nerve terminals and the mechanism for their storage, release and inactivation”, and in 2000 Carlsson {{was one of three}} winners who got the prize “for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system”.|$|E
25|$|B {{cells and}} T cells {{are derived from}} the same {{multipotent}} hematopoietic stem cells, and are morphologically indistinguishable from one another until after they are activated. B cells play {{a large role in}} the <b>humoral</b> immune response, whereas T cells are intimately involved in cell-mediated immune responses. In all vertebrates except Agnatha, B cells and T cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with HIV, infections {{may be more}} frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with bacteremia and antibiotic resistance. In participants of unprotected anal intercourse, campylobacteriosis is more localized to the distal end of the colon and may be termed a proctocolitis. The severity and persistence of infection in {{patients with}} AIDS and hypogammaglobulinemia indicates that both cell-mediated and <b>humoral</b> immunity are important in preventing and terminating infection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humoral</b> {{responses}} after {{a single}} DNA injection {{can be much}} longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza haemagglutinin was demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery. Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the bone marrow and spleen for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal of steroid {{medication}} {{can cause}} joint pain and diffuse muscle pain accompanied by fatigue; these symptoms resolve with recommencement of steroid therapy. Chronic steroid therapy {{can result in}} aseptic necrosis of the <b>humoral</b> or femoral head, resulting in shoulder or knee pain described as dull and aching, and reduced movement in or inability to use arm or hip. Aromatase inhibitors can cause diffuse muscle and joint pain and stiffness, and may {{increase the likelihood of}} osteoporosis and consequent fractures.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} herbal texts being produced, but also other medieval texts that {{discussed}} {{the importance of}} the humors. Hildegard of Bingen, a well known abbess, wrote about Hippocratic Medicine using <b>humoral</b> theory and how balance and imbalance of the elements affected the health of an individual, along with other known sicknesses of the time, and ways in which to combine both prayer and herbs to help the individual become well. She discusses different symptoms that were common to see and the known remedies for them.|$|E
25|$|The {{virus is}} known to {{instigate}} robust <b>humoral</b> immunity in animal models and in the human population, where up to 80% of individuals {{are thought to be}} seropositive for AAV2. Antibodies are known to be neutralising, and for gene therapy applications these do impact on vector transduction efficiency via some routes of administration. As well as persistent AAV specific antibody levels, it appears from both prime-boost studies in animals and from clinical trials that the B-cell memory is also strong. In seropositive humans, circulating IgG antibodies for AAV2 appear to be primarily composed of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses, with little or no IgG3 or IgG4 present.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both <b>humoral</b> immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E
