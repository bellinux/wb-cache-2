5|$|The {{eggs are}} oval, white and {{coarsely}} textured. All species normally lay {{at least two}} eggs; the usual clutch size <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can {{be as high as}} 95 percent but, because of sibling competition or siblicide, in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent’s pouch and feed themselves. Sometimes before, or especially after, being fed, they may seem to have a seizure that ends in falling unconscious; the reason is not clearly known.|$|E

25|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though abortions are against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on herself or consenting to an abortion <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> three years of imprisonment.

The mortality rate may {{be as high as}} 5%; however, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases with increase in survival rates up to 70 to 90% with figures including minor residual disability as well.

25|$|Feeding {{on a human}} {{who carries}} the {{bacterium}} infects the louse. R. prowazekii grows in the louse's gut and is excreted in its feces. The disease is then transmitted to an uninfected human who scratches the louse bite (which itches) and rubs the feces into the wound. The incubation period <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two weeks. R. prowazekii can remain viable and virulent in the dried louse feces for many days. Typhus will eventually kill the louse, though the disease will remain viable for many weeks in the dead louse.|$|E

Its egg accounts for 26 percent of its own weightthe equivalent of a human woman giving birth to a six-year-old child.|$|E

The onset of action <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> five minutes for IV administration and 15–30 minutes for IM administration. The duration of diazepam's peak pharmacological effects is 15 minutes to one hour for both routes of administration. The bioavailability after oral administration is 100%, and 90% after rectal administration. Peak plasma levels occur between 30 and 90 minutes after oral administration and between 30 and 60 minutes after intramuscular administration; after rectal administration, peak plasma levels occur after 10 to 45 minutes. Diazepam is highly protein-bound, with 96 to 99% of the absorbed drug being protein-bound. The distribution half-life of diazepam is two to 13 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, several symbols from the Middle Ages were revived as Slovenian {{national}} symbols.

After {{being used in the}} Flag of Slovenia, the graphical representation of Triglav has become recognised as a national symbol.

25|$|Predatory coccinellids {{are usually}} found on plants which harbour their prey. They {{lay their eggs}} near their prey, to {{increase}} the likelihood the larvae will find the prey easily. In Harmonia axyridis, eggs hatch in three to four days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen. Depending on resource availability, the larvae pass through four instars over 10–14 days, after which pupation occurs. After a teneral period of several days, the adults become reproductively active {{and are able to}} reproduce again later, although they may become reproductively quiescent if eclosing late in the season.

500|$|The coat of the Djungarian hamster is less woolly {{than that}} of [...] Campbell's dwarf hamster, and apart from the normal colouring, they can be {{coloured}} sapphire, sapphire pearl, or normal pearl. The head length of the Djungarian hamster is 70-90 mm, {{the length of the}} tail is 5-15 mm, and the hind legs are 11-15 mm. The body weight changes dramatically throughout the year. It is at its lowest during the winter. In males, the body weight ranges from , and in females, [...] In human care, they are slightly heavier.

[...] The incubation period is not known, but the species {{is thought to be}} a cooperative breeder, as more than two birds in a group have been observed defending the nest from intruders and feeding the young. Young birds, which are covered in white down as nestlings before developing their adult plumage, have been observed being fed acorn-shaped red berries and insects. Young birds will make a threat display when approached in the nest, rising up and erecting their head feathers. As chicks develop directly into adult plumage, {{it has been suggested that}} this display may be signalling its identity as a toxic species, even though young birds have not developed toxicity at that age.|$|E
500|$|The {{church was}} {{described}} by Francis Carolus Eeles ("St Decuman's Church") in 1932. He highlighted a fine geometrical east window with original tracery dating from [...] {{the end of the}} 13th century and the perpendicular window tracery in the south isle. The series of wagon roofs with rich carving are above the rood screen in nave and south aisle. The Wyndham Chapel occupies the east end of the north aisle and is dedicated to the Wyndham family of nearby Orchard Wyndham House, former lords of the manor. Included is a [...] memorial to Sir John Wyndham (15581645), who {{played an important role in}} the establishment of defence organisation in the West Country against the threat of the Spanish Armada. Next to his monument <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> his parents, and the chest tomb of his grandparents, with monumental brasses, serves to separate the chapel from the chancel. A mural monument exists with kneeling effigies of two of Sir John's sons, Henry and George, as well as other monuments to the later family of Wyndham.

[...] Dan Aquilante of New York Post commented that the song was [...] "slightly vapid but destined for radio... an optimistic piece in which Beyoncé... hits the booster rockets repeatedly". IGNs Chad Grischow wrote [...] "the song is actually the least compelling of the album, sounding far more interesting when the heavy bass thump finally strips away late for a great piano melody and bongo fuelled beat."

500|$|The theory {{depends on}} {{in part on}} tracing the {{ownership}} of certain estates, especially Compton in West Sussex, which was probably the Compton which was left to Æthelred's son Æthelhelm in Alfred the Great's will. It was later {{in the possession of}} Wulfnoth, presumably confiscated after his rebellion, and left to [...] "Godwin, Wulfnoth's son" [...] in 1014 in Æthelstan Ætheling's will. Immediately before the bequest to Godwin <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> an [...] "Ælmære". Calling him Ælmær, Anscombe identifies this legatee as Ealdorman Æthelmær the Stout, in his view the father of Wulfnoth Cild. [...] He supports this relationship with two further arguments. [...] He finds significance in the occurrence in documents of an Æthelmær with the same epithet as Wulfnoth, Cild, though another advocate of the theory, Lundie Barlow, found Anscombe's Cild argument [...] "untenable". Anscombe likewise places value in John of Worcester's pedigree that shows Godwin's father Wulfnoth as son of Agelmær, a brother of Eadric Streona. Though the Worcester chronicler gives his Agelmær a different father from the known father of Ealdorman Æthelmær, and Anscombe points out its inherent chronological problems, he argues that, though flawed, the pedigree retains the memory of a father-son relationship between Æthelmær the Stout and Wulfnoth Cild. Æthelmær was the son of the late tenth-century chronicler and ealdorman Æthelweard, whose own writings record that he was descended from ÆthelredI, although the exact nature of this descent has been debated.|$|E
