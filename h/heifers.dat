5|$|Selective {{breeding}} for desired traits {{was established}} as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. One of his most important breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, {{he was able to}} quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines. These sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds. Under his influence, English farmers began to breed cattle for use primarily as beef. Long-horned <b>heifers</b> were crossed with the Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the value}} of a <b>heifer</b> calf, a bred <b>heifer,</b> or a re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How does that value compare to the current market price? What is your cost of raising a <b>heifer</b> calf, bred <b>heifer,</b> or re-bred 2 nd calf cow? How many pencils have been worn dull or how many {{spreadsheets}} have been created to answer these questions? The unrealistic objective {{of this paper is to}} answer these questions. Perhaps a more realistic objective is to answer some of these questions and to provide you the framework to answer some of the questions for your own operation. One approach to determine value is to simply consider the market price for the <b>heifer.</b> However, this is only the true value if you actually sell the <b>heifer.</b> If you keep the <b>heifer,</b> then her true value is based on her future production, your annual costs to keep her, and the future market prices for calves and for a cull cow when the <b>heifer</b> is ultimately sold. When one considers these factors and how variable they are from year-to-year, from ranch-to-ranch and from heifer-to-heifer there is no single value that will be correct. However, there are some correct principles to determine these values for individual operations. Replacement <b>heifer</b> management from weaning of the <b>heifer</b> calf, to breeding, to calving and to re-breeding can greatly impact the future productivity of a <b>heifer</b> and therefore impact the value of the <b>heifer.</b> There may also be significant differences in costs associated with alternative <b>heifer</b> management programs. Four alternative <b>heifer</b> management programs will be briefly considered, primarily to illustrate a method of determining costs. A method of determining expected value will also be presented. The last section of the paper will present a historical comparison of the cost, value, and market price of a replacement <b>heifer...</b>|$|R
25|$|In a {{study on}} Holstein–Friesian <b>heifers</b> {{learning}} to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the <b>heifers</b> when moving along the race towards the food. When the <b>heifers</b> made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race. The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement.|$|E
25|$|Most dairy {{producers}} aim for {{a replacement}} heifer {{to give birth to}} her first calf, and thus join the milking herd, on her second birthday. As the cow’s gestation period is a little over 9 months this means the cow must be inseminated by the age of 15 months. Because the breeding process is inefficient, most producers aim to first breed their <b>heifers</b> between 12–14 months. Before a heifer can be bred she must reach sexual maturity and attain the proper body condition to successfully bear a calf. Puberty in cattle depends largely on weight among other factors. Holstein <b>heifers</b> reach puberty at an average body weight between 550 to 650 lbs. Smaller breeds of cattle, such as Jerseys, usually reach puberty earlier at a lighter weight. Under typical nutritional conditions, Holstein <b>heifers</b> will reach puberty at the age 9–10 months. Proper body condition for breeding is also largely judged by weight. At about 800lbs Holstein <b>heifers</b> will normally be able to carry a healthy calf and give birth with relative ease. In this way, the <b>heifers</b> will be able to give birth and join the milking herd before their second birthday.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively {{to make sure their}} diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called <b>heifers.</b> They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E
