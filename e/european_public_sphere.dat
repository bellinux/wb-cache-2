40|$|This is {{the draft}} summary chapter for a {{collection}} of essays, <b>European</b> <b>Public</b> Spheres: Politics is Back (forthcoming, Cambridge University Press). It critically assesses {{what we do and}} do not know about the relation of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to politics and the social more generally, and points out several gaps and challenges to address. First, arguments about <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> are ultimately claims about how language and communication shape politics. Recognizing that institutions, power and practice are important as well, scholars in other fields have supplemented the linguistic approach with other types of analysis. In work on <b>public</b> <b>spheres,</b> however, a similar move seems absent – which results in incomplete arguments, for example, on the relation of <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> to <b>European</b> identity. Second, how well do arguments on <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> hold up cross-nationally – or even in respect to the enlarged Europe that today’s reality? Third, beyond establishing that Europeanized <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> matter, future research needs to explore how much they matter. This will involve more ambitious research designs – establishing baselines and relative weightings, identifying scope conditions and thinking counterfactually...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{forms the}} {{introduction}} to a special issue of the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies on ‘Islam, Transnationalism, and the <b>Public</b> <b>Sphere</b> in Western Europe’. Taking as its starting point the seminal volume edited by Gerholm and Lithman—The New Islamic Presence in Western Europe (1988) —the paper reviews continuities and changes in European Muslim communities and their relationship with others. Drawing extensively on case studies based on anthropological research in four European countries (Britain, France, Germany and Italy), the paper first examines the problematic character of the category ‘Muslim’, and identifies ways in which Islam in a European context can be considered transnational. It then explores how the question of living as a Muslim in Europe is being addressed {{in the context of}} transnationalism, considers whether there is an emergent ‘European Islam’ or ‘European Muslim’ identity, and ends with consideration of the problems and prospects for Islam in <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>spheres...</b>|$|R

The behaviour of Muslims was studied through 50 focus groups conducted in Paris, London, Berlin and Amsterdam over the year 2007 - 08.

40|$|This study forms part of {{the ongoing}} debate on the Europeanization of {{national}} <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> – meaning that European issues, actors, and institutions become increasingly important in political communication and mobilization of the different member states – {{as a means of}} overcoming the problems of democracy in the European Union. Drawing on original data collected as part of a transnational research project, the study measures several theoretically possible forms of this process across three comparative dimensions: countries, policy domains, and years. The study shows that in all the countries, a fairly high degree of Europeanization can be observed for those policy fields where the EU enjoys a great amount of political competences, whilst the findings are almost negligent for those issues where the member states have retained their autonomy. The study thus reaches the conclusion that the “democratic deficit” does not stem primarily from the lack of Europeanized political debates covered in the mass media. Instead, the essence of the problem is shown to be the differential access political actors have for participating in political discourses. So far, <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>spheres</b> are overwhelmingly populated by the so-called elites – state and party actors – while civil society actors find it increasingly difficult to get a foothold beyond the nation-state level.

Visual and textual analyses examine a neglected perspective on the study of media representations of migration by examining a particular practice through which people engage with news images and participate in (re) construction of collective memory in relation to irregular migration. The analysis shows that while hegemonic Eurocentric imagery prevails also in the vernacular amateur productions, re-mixing different cultural productions nevertheless complicates the representation of irregular migration and affords alternative positions. The article examines an emerging area in memory studies: practices of vernacular commemoration and its convergence with more institutionalized and professional media and memory practices. The videos are communicative reactions to emotionally disturbing news images of suffering – the public’s re-articulations of migration and migration control, which nevertheless are constrained into the existing mainstream media framings and entertainment economies.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} religio-political {{dimensions}} of the changing logic of citizenship and its constitutive elements of membership, rights, and identity {{in the context of}} globalisation. It is based on comparative research on the patterns of symbolic and organisational incorporation of Muslim immigrant minorities in Britain, France and Germany in the period of 1973 - 2001. Differences between these three cases in the incorporation of Islam, as evinced by integration policies and educational policies, are explained by historical path-dependencies, notably by institutional patterns of state-church relationships (state-church, separation, co-operation) and the religious factor in the process of national-building. On the other hand, one can observe a successive convergence of incorporation patterns of Muslim minorities in <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>spheres,</b> exemplified by various discourses of inclusion and exclusion; to account for these trends, reference is made to the changing cultural and structural features of the world polity as theorised by sociology's neo-institutionalism. It is argued that the world polity model of the nation-state, which is epitomised by the coupling of political organisation and collective identity and is articulated in the institution of national citizenship, has undergone significant changes in the post-War era. These can best be captured by the de-coupling of political organisation and collective identity, and by the decomposition of the constitutive elements of citizenship. It is further argued that this global transformation is inducing new religious politics which is characterised by the inclusion of "religion" as a legitimate category of identity in the <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Thus, as <b>European</b> democracies are facing claims for the public recognition of particularistic religious identities whose legitimacy can be derived from universalistic human rights discourses, they are increasingly developing new institutional arrangements of religious diversity.

40|$|What {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the first Copyright Law, passed in England in 1710. The Statute of Anne, granted book publishers legal protection for 14 years with the commencement of the Statute. The law reflected social and economic transformations of the time especially the rise of readers and the emergence of "unlicensed" publishers. The latter, taking advantage from a legal vacuum between 1695 and 1710, where the monopoly of 'licensed' publishers held by the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers (the Stationers' Company), came to fulfil communication needs of the forming public. The position of the Stationers' Company had been traditionally strong because every printed book had to be registered and only members of the Stationers' were allowed to register them; but after the Licensing act came to an end in 1695, the Scottish and Irish publishers were selling and printing unlicensed books in the English market avoiding the taxes and the inscription at the Stationer's register. This referential starting point of the Copyright regime coincides chronologically with major epistemic changes: the Enlightenment. The legislation of copyright as a form of property should not be separated from these changes in science, art and philosophy. But they should not be separated either from the conditions related to the political change and the emergency of the Bourgeois <b>Public</b> <b>Sphere.</b> A few years before the Statute of Anne, John Locke distinguished the right of property from nature in probably one of his most conflictive works "Two Treatises of Government". At the same time, the English writer assumed the right of property {{to be one of the}} fundamental rights of the individual. This reasoning reveals that before the distinction between right and nature, the idea of property as a right could not be formulated. Without property being a fundamental right, then, the copyright legislation would not have taken place. Locke's work is also used as reference to trace the origins of the bourgeois <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> His "Two treatises", with his "Letters of Tolerance" are milestones in the transformation of the considerations around religion and opinion: again, the split between thought, opinion and belief. Such an epistemic distinction lies at the base of any discussion related to the formation of the public opinion. The public opinion is grounded in the <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> It was not long before the writings by Locke that Kant proclaimed the need of the individuals to set their own rules, collectively, individually, as having come to age for it. Religion was displaced to the realms of the transcendental; and philosophy was given the role to explore the realms of the practical reason (see Sue Curry Jansen). The conquest of a new field of thought aside from the divine activity allowed the presence of a new context of action, thought decision-making and government. This context is the one immediately related to the formation of a private sphere split in two dimensions: the domestic dimension of individual privacy and intimacy and the economic dimension of private property and business. The first law of copyright has to be considered in this context of political and epistemic change. The new conditions of knowledge for the law, the context of social and economic changes, the interests for profit-making and the new logics of the market are very visible in the Statute of Anne. But it is also clear that the copyright law was related to the new formation of the bourgeois <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Only thanks to this exercise of contextualisation the necessary proximity between the laws of copyright (related to privacy of property and of creation as thought) and the formation of the bourgeois <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> can be made visible. It is not, actually the <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> what is of matter in the structural transformation as discussed by Habermas, but the emergence of a private realm that modulates the particularities of the <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> provoking a structural transformation (Strukturwandel) that goes from the Representative Publicity of the Feudal system to the new formed Bourgeois <b>Public</b> <b>Sphere.</b> It is this private element and precondition for the functioning of an (ultimately imaginary or mediated) <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> that is of particular relevance in the study of current copyright laws in the digital media. Present transformations of the copyright system are to be studied as part of international policy regimes of Intellectual Property, built on the Berne and the Rome Convention in the late 19 th century that slowly transformed into the current WIPO under the auspices of the WTO. The progressive enlargement of the economic private sphere concerning business and property at expenses of a notorious reduction of the policies related to the intimate formation of the critical thought, are affecting the same nature of the private sphere. The copyright laws were once created with the intention of contributing to the "Encouragement of Learning" but now they seem to reinforce a private sphere without individuals with critical opinions. The forms of the copyright law and the policies implemented related to them seem to negatively affect the proper functioning of the <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> This paper explores the continuities, quality and the changes in the features relating the copyright policies at national, European and International levels to determine to what extent and under which conditions could copyright be a hindrance in the functioning of a proper democratic <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> This paper explores the laws of intellectual property of France, Spain, Germany, Austria and the UK as well as the Copyright directives promoted by the European Parliament (ie. Directive 2001 / 29 /EC) with the purpose of harmonise the various copyright laws of the member states and submit to the Copyright Treaty of the WIPO. The analysis of the laws will be done seeking at the forms and references under which the national and <b>European</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Spheres</b> are directly or indirectly taken into consideration.

That is why in the next step we analyse CIDEL‟s three models of the <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> elucidating their interrelations with the problematics of pre-political values, political culture and Euro-citizens‟ identity. Our standpoint, which we are elaborating in the paper, is that the post-metaphysical – it means: „discursively constructed” – European identity is possible to achieve, however under premises of a “never-ending story of justification” political and legal principles and also of a correlated with it civic education fostering democratic competences of Euro-citizens in order to spark the general (<b>European)</b> <b>public</b> and processes of Euro-legitimation...|$|R

Since 1996 he has coordinated the series of Eurobarometer surveys on ‘Biotechnology and the Life Sciences’ for DG Research. He was principal investigator of ‘Life Sciences in European Society’ (LSES), a European comparative study of biotechnology in the <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> funded by FP6 of the European Commission and more recently ‘Sensitive technologies and <b>European</b> <b>Public</b> Ethics’ (STEPE).|$|R

Global <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them. The concept of global <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> {{is linked to the}} shift of <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.|$|R
