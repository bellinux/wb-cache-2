25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she never would have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E

500|$|Selena {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} writing and recording a track based on a story about her grandparents titled [...] "Amor Prohibido". She explained it to A.B. who began co-writing it with Astudillo and herself. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as [...] "forbidden love". Pérez wrote that during its recording session: here was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo, especially. I can't {{say that it was}} an improvement, exactly, because I always thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible. It's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before, and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result. While recording the song, Selena had ad-libbed [...] "oh baby". Her brother believed that the recording would [...] "not have been the same <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> added the 'oh baby' part." ...|$|E

Tosh and Jack rush to the couple's room, where Jack identifies Brenda as an alien and calls her an [...] "ugly bitch". After Brenda protests her innocence and Rhys punches Jack, Gwen states that Rhys' mother is not the shapeshifter as Brenda wears a distinctive perfume. Torchwood reach the garden to find the Nostrovite, in Brenda's image, with Mary. The alien holds Mary hostage, demanding that Gwen give her her child. Gwen walks towards them and as the Nostrovite releases Mary, Gwen reveals a hidden gun in her wedding bouquet and fires at the creature. Owen suggests using a piece of alien equipment called the singularity scalpel to destroy the alien fetus. He sends Gwen {{to her room and}} teaches Rhys how to use the scalpel; Owen cannot use it himself due to injuries sustained in his undead state. Gwen is approached by Jack and reveals to him that she would have married Rhys a long time ago <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> met him. She leans in as he appears to be ready to kiss her but he reveals himself to be the Nostrovite. Owen enters, shooting the creature whilst Gwen exits with Rhys.

500|$|This {{version of}} her speech is found in Foxe's, Actes and Monuments and an almost {{identical}} version in Ives (2005). In a 1,318 line poem, written in French, two weeks after Anne's death, Lancelot de Carle provides a moving account of her last words and their effect on the crowd:She gracefully addressed {{the people from the}} scaffold with a voice somewhat overcome by weakness, but which gathered strength as she went on. She begged her hearers to forgive her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used them all with becoming gentleness, and asked for their prayers. It was needless, she said, to relate why she was there, but she prayed the Judge of all the world to have compassion on those who had condemned her, and she begged them to pray for the King, in whom she had always found great kindness, fear of God, and love of his subjects. The spectators could not refrain from tears.Lancelot de Carle, a secretary to the French Ambassador, Antoine de Castelnau, was in London in May 1536, and was an eyewitness to her trial and execution.John Guy contends that Crispin de Milherve, who was an eyewitness to Anne Boleyn's trial and execution, and Lancelot de Carle have been shown by French scholars to be the same person. The poem, Épistre Contenant le Procès Criminel Faict à l'Encontre de la Royne Anne Boullant d'Angleterre, (A Letter Containing the Criminal Charges Laid Against Queen Anne Boleyn of England), provides a detailed account of Anne's early life and the circumstances relating to her arrest, trial and execution. All the accounts are similar. It is thought that Anne avoided criticising Henry to save Elizabeth and her family from further consequences, but even under such extreme pressure Anne did not confess guilt, and indeed subtly implied her innocence, in her appeal to those who might [...] "meddle of my cause".|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E
