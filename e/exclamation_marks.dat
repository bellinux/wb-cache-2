5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
25|$|Cantonese has not {{historically}} used <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks.</b> Usage of <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> {{is common}} in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions.

5000|$|In French, next to <b>marking</b> <b>exclamations</b> or {{indicating}} astonishment, the <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> is also {{commonly used}} to mark orders or requests: Viens ici ! (English: [...] "Come here!"). A space (« espace fine ») is used between the last word and the <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> in European French, but not in Canadian French. One can also combine an <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> with a question mark {{at the end of}} a sentence where appropriate.|$|R

The <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> was later the subject of a bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the Seinfeld episode, [...] "The Sniffing Accountant". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> {{at the end of a}} message about a friend having a baby.

25|$|Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is {{considered}} a striking example of New Journalism. This account of the Merry Pranksters, a famous sixties counter-culture group, was highly experimental in Wolfe's use of onomatopoeia, free association, and eccentric punctuation—such as multiple <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> and italics—to convey the manic ideas and personalities of Ken Kesey and his followers.|$|E

Question and <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> can be used even in highlighted titles.|$|E

If all <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrator of}} the poem is less {{concerned}} {{with the experience of}} observing Lucy than with his reflections and meditations on his observations. Throughout the poem sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, a fact emphasised by the <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> {{in the second and third}} verses. The critic Carl Woodring writes that [...] "She dwelt" [...] and the Lucy series can be read as elegiac, as [...] "sober meditation on death". He found that they have [...] "the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the Greek Anthology... f all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance".|$|E

The unit was still based at Tangmere, flying Hurricanes, and was by now fighting in the Battle of Britain, the Allied participants of which would later be dubbed [...] "The Few".

500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to navigate the}} cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her , constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the Rights of Woman. She uses the language of philosophy, referring to {{her work as a}} [...] "treatise" [...] with [...] "arguments" [...] and [...] "principles". However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing [...] "I" [...] and [...] "you", dashes and <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks,</b> and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text. The Rights of Woman further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, {{while at the same time}} claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{male voice}} actor was sought for the Japanese {{adaptation}} of the Naruto role, the actress Junko Takeuchi was chosen instead over many male applicants. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks,</b> which helped her to define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II. She had to record the first episode of Part II when Naruto's character was older and more mature only one week after voicing the younger, immature character. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with her feeling he was [...] "a very reliable young man". She admired his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.|$|E
