2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the decade, Haggard {{composed}} several number-one hits, including [...] "Mama Tried," [...] "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," [...] "Hungry Eyes," [...] and [...] "Sing Me Back Home." [...] Daniel Cooper calls [...] "Sing Me Back Home" [...] "a ballad {{that works}} on so many different levels of the soul it defies one's every attempt to analyze it." [...] In a 1977 interview in Billboard with Bob Eubanks, Haggard reflected, [...] "Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind—that's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind." [...] In 1969, Haggard's first tribute LP , was also released to acclaim.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{photograph}} posted on Instagram by Steubenville High football player Cody Saltsman, {{the victim was}} shown looking unresponsive, being carried by two teenage boys by her wrists and ankles. Former Steubenville baseball player Michael Nodianos, responding to hearsay of the event, tweeted [...] "Some people deserve to be peed on," [...] which was retweeted later by several people, including Mays. In a 12-minute video later posted to YouTube, Nodianos and others talk about the rapes, with Nodianos joking that [...] "they raped her quicker than Mike Tyson raped that one girl" [...] and [...] "They peed on her. That's <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> she's dead, because someone pissed on her." [...] While he did not sexually assault the victim himself, Nodianos, a scholarship student at Ohio State at the time news of the rape broke, received numerous threats for his comments, as did his family in Steubenville, and subsequently dropped out of school. In one text, Mays described the victim as [...] "like a dead body" [...] and [...] "deader than Caylee Anthony" [...] and in another he told the victim that a photo of her lying naked in a basement with semen on her body had been taken by him, and that the semen was his. In a text message to a friend afterwards, he said [...] "I shoulda raped her now that everybody thinks I did," [...] but [...] "she wasn't awake enough." ...|$|E
