5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E
25|$|Little can {{be known}} about Plato's early life and {{education}} {{due to the}} very limited accounts. Plato came {{from one of the}} wealthiest and most politically active families in Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies. His father contributed <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> to give to his son a good education, and Plato therefore must have been instructed in grammar, music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era.|$|E
25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, Bush was told by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed {{that he had done}} <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty. Bush lost reelection in 1992 in large part because the American people, concerned about the economy, voted for change.|$|E

25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf that they would do <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that if that were the case he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1921, a general {{change-over}} from revkoms and kombeds to Soviets took place. In order to help the Azerbaijani oil industry the Supreme Council of the National Economy decided {{in the same year}} to provide it with <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> out of turn. The new oilfields, like Ilyich Bay, Qara-Chukhur, Lok-Batan and Kala have been discovered. In 1929 a great kolkhoz movement had developed and Azerbaijan became the second Soviet tea producer after the Georgian SSR for the first time. On 31 March 1931 the oil industry of the Azerbaijan SSR, which supplied over 60% of the total Soviet oil production at the time, was awarded the Order of Lenin. The republic gained the second Order on 15 March 1935 during the observation of its 15th anniversary. At {{the end of the second}} five-year plan (1933–1937) Azerbaijan appeared at 3rd place in the Soviet Union by its capital investment size. In 1938, the Azerbaijani alphabet was changed from Latin to Cyrillic alphabet.|$|E

5|$|The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty, while {{superseding}} the 1922 agreement, nonetheless kept many of {{the same}} requirements, though it restricted gun size on new warships to 14-inch.

25|$|During the {{frequent}} absences of Gustavus in Livonia and in Finland (1614–1616) Oxenstierna acted as his viceroy. One assignment Oxenstierna received while {{the king was}} in Livonia, was the task to finalize the negotiations regarding the marriage of John Casimir and the king's sister, Princess Catharina. At the coronation of Gustavus Adolphus, in October 1617, Oxenstierna was knighted. In 1620 he headed the embassy dispatched to Berlin to arrange the nuptial contract between Gustavus and Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. During the king's Russian and Polish wars he had the principal duty of supplying the armies and the fleets with <b>everything</b> <b>necessary,</b> including men and money. Oxenstierna's ways of carrying out his assignments apparently gained King Gustavus's appreciation, since the king, in 1622, asked Oxenstierna to accompany him to Livonia and appointed him Governor-General and commandant of Riga, a strategically important town during the ongoing war against Poland. His services in Livonia gained him the reward of four castles (among others Burtnieki and Valmiera) and the whole bishopric of Wenden. Entrusted with the peace negotiations {{which led to the}} truce with Poland in 1623, he succeeded in averting a threatened rupture with Denmark in 1624. The Polish-Swedish War was reinitiated in 1626, and on 7 October that year, Oxenstierna became Governor-General in the newly acquired Swedish possession of Prussia. In 1629 he concluded the advantageous Truce of Altmark with Poland-Lithuania. Prior to this, in September 1628, he arranged a joint occupation of Stralsund with Denmark in order to prevent that important fortress from falling {{into the hands of the}} Imperialists.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, {{thanks to}} a sex manual {{discovered}} by Benjie, become convinced they know <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this {{by going to the}} cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, [...] "giving" [...] Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to [...] "put the moves" [...] on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.|$|E
500|$|Both Shelley and her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, {{exceeded}} {{the bounds of}} {{what would have been}} considered [...] "the normal purview of the female writer" [...] in their travel narratives. Shelley excitedly describes running the rapids in a canoe, for example, and describes the economic status and technological development of the areas she visits. In Paris, she comments on the lack of drains in the streets, in Berlin she visits a steel mill, and throughout the text she describes how the new railways are impacting on travel. Shelley's travel narrative is marked by a specific [...] "ethic of travel"—that one must learn to sympathise both physically and emotionally with those one encounters. Her travels are sentimental, and travel writing for her is [...] "an exploration of the self through an encounter with the other". Her language even mirrors that of her mother. Wollstonecraft describes the frontier of Sweden as [...] "the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> to give life and beauty" [...] while Shelley describes the Simplon Pass as having [...] "a majestic simplicity that inspired awe; the naked bones of a gigantic world were here: the elemental substance of fair mother Earth".|$|E

500|$|... "Rose" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} {{was seen as}} a successful relaunch to the programme. Harry Venning of The Stage praised Davies' script, particularly for taking it seriously and making it scary. He was pleased with Piper's acting and Rose, who proved to be more independent than her predecessors. However, he felt that Eccleston was [...] "the show's biggest disappointment" [...] as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series, and praised the acting and characters of Eccleston, Piper, and Clarke. However, he felt that some of the humour— such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey— was not as enjoyable as an adult. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for [...] " [...] an adult approach to one of television's most famous characters" [...] and [...] " [...] the cash-strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high-tech market". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times described the revival as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "intelligent and well-done". Daily Mail writer Michael Hanlon said that [...] "As a fan I really hope this new series succeeds. It's lively, well filmed and the special effects are up to scratch. There is humour, a vital ingredient if the new series is to be a success." [...] He also felt that <b>everything</b> <b>necessary</b> for Doctor Who was present in [...] "Rose". However, Stephen Brook of The Guardian said that it was [...] "pitched at its youngest ever audience", and also felt that the episode had an [...] "overdose on humour".|$|E
