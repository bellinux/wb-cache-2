40|$|Abstract Background: We have empirically {{noted that}} many {{physicians}} routinely request anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) without a correct clinical indication. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate retrospectively whether aPL testing at our Thrombosis Centre was <b>justified.</b> Methods: Medical records from 520 subjects for aPL screening tests for various clinical conditions were reviewed. The aPL screening tests were: lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β(2) glycoptotein I (aβ(2) GPI). Requests for aPL screening were divided into <b>justified,</b> potentially <b>justified</b> or not adequately <b>justified.</b> Results: aPL testing requests were considered <b>justified</b> in 358 (69 %) patients, potentially <b>justified</b> in 66 (12. 6 %) and not adequately <b>justified</b> in 96 (18. 4 %). LA was positive in 65 (18 %) of <b>justified</b> requests and in only one (1 %) of the 96 potentially <b>justified</b> requests. None of the 66 not adequately <b>justified</b> for aPL testing was positive for LA. aβ(2) [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Foundationalism is {{an attempt}} to respond to the regress problem of {{justification}} in epistemology. According to this argument, every proposition requires justification to support it, but any justification also needs to be <b>justified</b> itself. If this goes on ad infinitum, {{it is not clear how}} anything in the chain could be <b>justified.</b> Foundationalism holds that there are 'basic beliefs' which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs. Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly <b>justified</b> belief is completely <b>justified</b> by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly <b>justified</b> beliefs require basic beliefs to be <b>justified,</b> but can be further <b>justified</b> by other factors.|$|R

5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments.

5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality.

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to <b>justify</b> a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which <b>justify</b> pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E

5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did not <b>justify</b> why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E
5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise the campaign and provide a reason to <b>justify</b> preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to <b>justify</b> the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to <b>justify</b> its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} <b>justify</b> the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Some solo verbal {{reasoning}} serves {{the function of}} arriving at a correct {{answer to a question}} from information at the reasoner’s disposal. Such reasoning is good if and only if its grounds are <b>justified</b> and adequate, its warrant is <b>justified,</b> and the reasoner is <b>justified</b> in assuming that no defeaters apply. I distinguish seven sources of <b>justified</b> grounds and state the conditions under which each source is trustworthy. Adequate grounds include all good relevant information practically obtainable by the reasoner. The claim must follow from the grounds in accordance with a <b>justified</b> general warrant. If this warrant is not universal, the reasoner must be <b>justified</b> in assuming that no exception-making circumstances hold in the particular case to which it is applied.
