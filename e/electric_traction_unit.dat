50|$|In 2009, the 5BEL Trust {{launched}} a six-year programme {{to return a}} complete five car Brighton Belle train to mainline operation. This is currently the largest rail restoration project underway in the UK and represents {{the first time that}} a heritage <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> will return to the mainline; excursion services on the third rail supply will commence in May 2016.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on {{improving}} main operating system of the <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units.</b> The main theme is stronger safety for the unit during the ride and keeping the unit movable {{if there is some}} problem with the brakes. First par of the thesis {{is focused on}} <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units</b> and their brake systems. Second part is most about the new screen implementation. This screen shows, if there is some problem with the brakes and the most important part is the speed controller. It is the instrument for the safety arrival of the unit with some brake damage...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods to}} compensate and monitor the disturbance generated by <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> considering {{their position in}} different times, in a railway system. For this purpose, first of all, experimental data of Italy traction system is used and its components are modeled. Then, using proposed algorithm a suitable location for a passive filter is determined. Subsequently, considering Speed of <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> the location of each <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> is predicted and with proposed THD index, created disturbance in each time is determined. Finally, {{in the span of}} 1 minute, proposed index is monitored. It is worth mentioning that the Matlab / Simulink software is used to simulate proposed model...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a small}} yard at the Birmingham end of the station, {{in front}} of the {{shopping}} centre that was once part of Coventry's yard, that is used by London Midland for the stabling of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> no heavy work is carried out at Coventry as that is done at either Soho TMD (for Class 323s) or Northampton Siemens depot (Class 350s). All diesel units are stabled at Tyseley TMD where they are cleaned, maintained and refuelled. These units are only used on the local service to Nuneaton.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, the {{pantographs}} {{of older}} vehicles are raised by air pressure, and the graphite contact strips cover some vents in the pantograph head which release the air if a graphite strip is lost, automatically lowering the pantograph to prevent damage. Newer <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units</b> may use more sophisticated methods involving microprocessors which detect the disturbances caused by arcing {{at the point}} of contact if the graphite strips are damaged. There are always at least two pantographs so the other one can be used if one is damaged. The rearmost pantograph in relation to the direction of travel is often, though not always, used to preclude damage to the other in case of entanglements.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the ÖGEG {{procured}} a Class 142 locomotive in Romania. This {{class was}} a 214 or 12 built under licence in Romania, {{the largest and}} most powerful steam locomotive of Austrian design. It was back in service by 1993. After the collapse of the Iron Curtain, numerous well-preserved German locomotives could be bought, particularly from Romania, but also in the former German Democratic Republic. As a result the society was criticised because funding was used to buy several German locomotives without any connexion to the railway history of Austria. These engines were however used commercially for special services with great success. On the retirement of older locomotives from the ÖBB in the early 1990s the ÖGEG also obtained many <b>electric</b> and diesel <b>traction</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} a {{collaboration}} between the “Polo per la Mobilità Sostenibile” (Pomos) and NOZOMI Motor and it {{is focused on the}} hybridization of an off-road vehicle, with 2. 2 litres four cylinders petrol engine. The aim is to build an hybrid parallel vehicle with only few simple upgrades. Through these we expect to reduce fuel consumption by 25 % and the formation of pollutants. This project provides the update of the vehicle, by an Ansaldo AC three-phase asynchronous electric drive, liquid cooled. The AC electric drive can be used with the internal combustion engine, in order to move the rear axle, or without the ICE to allow the use in full <b>electric</b> <b>traction.</b> A control <b>unit</b> provides the interaction of the two engines. Energy storage system is made by KOKAM Li-ion batteries. These are tested in charge and discharge cycles to evaluate their features...|$|R

40|$|The Institution of Engineering and Technology. Operational {{data from}} Chinese {{railways}} indicate {{a number of}} challenges for traction four-quadrant converter (4 QC) control including low-order voltage and current harmonics and reference tracking. A control strategy for a single-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped 4 QC employed in the <b>electric</b> multiple <b>unit</b> <b>traction</b> system is proposed in this study. The strategy {{is based on a}} multiple frequency tuned quasi-proportional resonant controller in the ac-side current loop and a multiple frequency tuned notch filter in the dc-link voltage loop. Under the typical supply voltage distortion present in the network, the proposed control strategy improves the current tracking performance and reduces the line current harmonics, when compared with conventional control strategies. Experimental results, both under purely sinusoidal and distorted supply voltages, validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy...|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of interurbans {{in the late}} nineteenth century resulted from the convergence of two trends: improvements in <b>electric</b> <b>traction,</b> and an untapped demand for transportation in rural areas, particularly in the Midwestern United States. The 1880s saw the first successful deployments of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> in streetcar systems. Most of these built on the pioneering work of Frank J. Sprague, who developed an improved method for mounting an <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> motor and using a trolley pole for pickup. Sprague's work led to widespread acceptance of <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> for streetcar operations and end of horse-drawn trams.|$|R
