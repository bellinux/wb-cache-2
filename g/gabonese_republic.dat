40|$|This {{discourse}} is a {{comparative study of}} the criminalisation of the violation of a corpse in context of traditional medicine in subequatorial Africa, including consideration of customary law and seeks specifically to examine whether the use of body parts for medicine falls within the paradigm of traditional medicine as opposed to professed any use in witchcraft. The question of any possible cultural defence for the violation of a corpse in traditional medicine is also examined. Regard {{has been given to}} relevant legislative precepts in subequatorial Africa including any common-law position, any statutory legislative precepts, including constitutional law, for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic,</b> the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, the Republic of the Congo, the Republics of Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the United Republic of Tanzania. In the Republic of South Africa, the violation of a corpse is a common-law crime, which sees its origins historically in Roman law and Roman-Dutch law. It has been found that the penal codes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic,</b> the Republics of Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania criminalise acts of violation on any corpse, but are applicable only to perpetrators and not to end-users, except for the Republic of Rwanda and the possessors of body parts for the Republic of Burundi. In the Republic of South Africa any removal of or trade in any body part in contravention of any law is also a criminal offence. Research has not found any specific reference to the violation of a corpse for the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, the Republic of the Congo, the Republics of Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe in extant legislative precepts, but all subequatorial African constitutions provide for the right to life. Case law relating to the violation of a corpse for traditional medicine purposes has been found only for the Republic of South Africa, for the then-Rhodesia and the Republic of Botswana. In most of the subequatorial African countries, customary law is valid only insofar as it does not conflict with the constitutions of the majority of countries, with the exceptions of the constitutions of the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic,</b> the Republic of Congo and the United Republic of Tanzania for which no provision for customary law in the constitutions of these countries has been found. In the Republic of South Africa, customary law, or a cultural defence is not condoned in instances of murder for body parts according to case law. Since research has discovered only a paucity of case law relating to the crime of violating a corpse in traditional medicine circumstances, it has not been possible to ascertain whether such use is widespread within traditional medicine, or confined to specific instances only. This discourse concludes that the legal position of the crime of violating a corpse for the use of body parts in traditional medicine in the Republic of South Africa should not be reviewed to accommodate such use, but that all relevant legal precepts should be reviewed and changed purposefully to provide for clarification for the specificity of this crime and to oppose any perception of such practices and beliefs in traditional medicine as being justified in any manner.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{traces the}} {{historical}} development of lexicography in Gabon. Gabon, like most African countries, is multilingual. The recent inventories of languages spoken in Gabon are those established by Jacquot (1978) and Kwenzi-Mikala (1998). According to Kwenzi-Mikala (1997), there are 62 speech forms divided into 10 language groups or language-units in Gabon. These speech forms co-exist with French, the official language. In fact, in article 2 of paragraph 8 of the revised Constitution of 1994 the following can be read: "The <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic</b> adopts French {{as the official}} language. Furthermore, she endeavours to protect and promote the national languages. " This constitutional arrangement naturally makes French the language used in education, administration and the media. The survey of lexicography in Gabon that is presented here includes the linguistic situation in and the language policy of Gabon, the lexicographic survey itself, as well as the lexicographic needs of the different speech forms (including languages and dialects). Initially, the pioneers of Gabonese lexicography were missionaries or colonial administrators. Very little was done in this field by the Gabonese themselves. Although credit is to be given to these early works, {{there are a number of}} shortcomings regarding the linguistic as well as the metalexicographic contents of dictionaries and lexicons produced during this period. In fact, the main weak point of those studies was the lack of tones in the written transcription of oral productions and orthographic problems. Furthermore, in those contributions, the theory of lexicography is largely unknown and lexico-graphic works are hardly ever based on authentic data corpora of the languages being described...|$|E

40|$|New {{field and}} geochronological data {{obtained}} {{in the course of}} a mapping project financed by the European Union (Sysmin Funds) and by the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic</b> enable precise chronological constraints to be placed on the timing and context of BIF deposition in Gabon. Field and petrographic observations allow the BIF-hosting greenstone belts to be related to a single lithostratigraphic unit: the "Belinga Group" (Chevallier et al., 2002; Thiéblemont et al., 2009; Thiéblemont, 2009). This group was affected by a generalized Neoarchean tectono-metamorphic event which culminated at 2746 ± 7 Ma in Northeastern Gabon. Dating of detrital zircons from the BIF and related coarse-grained detrital rocks from 2918 ± 7 Ma to 2868 ± 9 Ma implies that the deposition and further deformation of the Belinga Group took place in the interval 2868 - 2750 Ma, close to the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary. The Mesoarchean in Gabon was a period of intense plutonic activity, with a wide range of granitoids dated between ca. 3 Ga and 2. 8 Ga. Plutonism started with mainly intermediate rocks of dioritic to granodioritic composition and ended with the emplacement of pink granitoids of monzogranitic to syenogranitic composition. Precise geochronological data show that these granites were emplaced between 2870 and 2810 Ma. In addition to granitic plutonism and BIF deposition, the existence of vast charnockitic domains within the Mesoarchean basement attests for a period of intense heating of the recently accreted crust around the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary. Repeated geochronological measurements (U/Pb on zircon, U-Th-Pb on monazite) on a syn- to late-charnockitic leucogranite from Northeastern Gabon enable this HT metamorphism to be precisely dated around 2820 Ma (~± 10 Ma). This implies that the emplacement of BIF around the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary was correlative with an intense heat transfer from the mantle to the crust which preceded a major orogenic event around 2. 75 Ga...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly {{developing}} countries contain both {{the bulk of}} intact natural areas and biodiversity, and the greatest untapped natural resource stocks, placing them {{at the forefront of}} "green" economic development opportunities. However, most lack scientific tools to create development plans that account for biodiversity and ecosystem services, diminishing the real potential to be sustainable. Existing methods focus on biodiversity and carbon priority areas across large geographies (e. g., countries, states/provinces), leaving out essential services associated with water supplies, among others. These hydrologic ecosystem services (HES) are especially absent from methods applied at large geographies and in data-limited contexts. Here, we present a novel, spatially explicit, and relatively simple methodology to identify countrywide HES priority areas. We applied our methodology to the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic,</b> a country undergoing a major economic transformation under a governmental commitment to balance conservation and development goals. We present the first national-scale maps of HES priority areas across Gabon for erosion control, nutrient retention, and groundwater recharge. Priority sub-watersheds covered 44 % of the country's extent. Only 3 % of the country was identified as a priority area for all HES simultaneously, highlighting the need to conserve different areas for each different hydrologic service. While spatial tradeoffs occur amongst HES, we identified synergies with two other conservation values, given that 66 % of HES priority areas intersect regions of above average area-weighted (by sub-watersheds) total forest carbon stocks and 38 % intersect with terrestrial national parks. Considering implications for development, we identified HES priority areas overlapping current or proposed major roads, forestry concessions, and active mining concessions, highlighting the need for proactive planning for avoidance areas and compensatory offsets to mitigate potential conflicts. Collectively, our results provide insight into strategies to protect HES as part of Gabon's development strategy, while providing a replicable methodology for application to new scales, geographies, and policy contexts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Francevillian Group in <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic</b> was {{recently}} {{established as a}} typical sedimentary sequence for the Paleoproterozoic. However, its age is rather poorly constrained, mainly based on Rb-Sr and Nd-Sm datings. This study reports new zircon data obtained from Chaillu massif and N'goutou complex, which constrain the protolith age of the basement orthogneisses and the igneous age of an intrusive granite, respectively. Most zircons from the orthogneisses are blue and exhibit oscillatory zoning in cathode-luminescence images. Zircons with lower common lead abundances tend to be distributed close to the concordia curve. Two age clusters around 2860  Ma and 2910  Ma are found in zircons plotted on the concordia curve. Based on the Th/U ratios of zircons, these ages correspond to the protolith ages of the orthogneisses, and the zircons are not metamorphic in origin. Syenites and granites were collected from the N'goutou complex that intrudes into the FA and FB units of the Francevillian Group. The granitoids exhibit chemical composition of A-type granite affinity. Half of zircons separated from the granite are non-luminous, and the remaining half exhibit obscure internal textures under cathode-luminescence observation. All zircon grains contain significant amounts of common lead; the lead isotopic variability is probably attributed to the mixing of two components in the zircons. The zircon radiogenic 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ratio is 0. 13707  ±  0. 0010, corresponding to a 207 Pb/ 206 Pb age of 2191  ±  13  Ma. This constrains the minimum depositional age of the FA and FB units. Furthermore, the FB unit consists of manganese-rich carbonate rocks and organic carbon-rich black shales with macroscopic fossils. Based on our age constraints, these organisms appeared {{in the study area}} just after the last Paleoproterozoic Snowball Earth event, in concert with global scale oxidation event encompassing the Snowball Earth...|$|E
40|$|New field, petrographical, geochemical (major {{and trace}} element analyses) and geochronological (U/Pb zircon ages) data were {{obtained}} {{in the course of}} a mapping project financed by the European Union (Sysmin Funds) and by the <b>Gabonese</b> <b>Republic.</b> They enable precise constraints to be placed on the timing and characteristics of the Neoproterozoic evolution of SW-Gabon. The studied terrains lie at the northwestern end of the West Congo Belt. They are attributed to the West Congolian Group; the upper part of the Neoproterozoic series in this Panafrican belt. The magmatism in SW-Gabon is much less developed than in W-Congo where extensive accumulations of Neoproterozoic basic and felsic lavas exist. Until now, the only reported magmatic complex of possible Neoproterozoic age in SW-Gabon was a gabbroic intrusion from the Mayumba region, close to the Atlantic shore line. New geological mapping at the 1 / 200, 000 scale reveals possible extensions of this basic plutonism at the base of the West Congolian Group where it occurs as dispersed doleritic bodies and isolated ultrabasic rocks. As a whole, magmatism indeed appears to constitute a subordinated part of the Neoproterozoic terrains. A precise U/Pb zircon age of 904 ± 6 Ma obtained on the Mayumba Gabbro is similar to that of extensive basaltic lavas forming the lower-intermediate part of the neoproterozoic series in Congo (Mayumbian Group). Likewise, a 867 ± 4 Ma age has been obtained on discrete occurrences of biotite granite mapped around the Mayumba Gabbro. The Mayumba Gabbro displays a tholeiitic and strongly depleted signature consistent with emplacement in an extensional zone (rift) away from any convergent margin. Likewise, the biotite granite shows a typical within-plate signature of alkaline and rather "enriched" type. Following tholeiitic to alkaline magmatism, extension in the West Congo Belt of SW-Gabon appears to have occurred all along the Neoproterozoic resulting in the deposition of a thick series of alternating detrital and carbonated rocks. Possible volcanic-derived materials in this series are limited and restricted to its lower part, which is consistent with Gabon has having been located aside the major zone of extension within the West Congolian Belt. An U/Pb zircon age of 713 ± 49 Ma obtained on an isolated occurrence of tuffaceous rock from the upper part of the lower detrital group (Louila unit) places a first constraint on the timing of the filling of the basin in Gabon. This age is consistent with attribution of a subsequent tillitic unit (Niari Tillite) to the Marinoan (ca. 635 Ma) glaciation. Following this event, the mainly carbonated Schisto-calcaire Sub-group and subsequent detrital Schisto-gréseux Sub-group (equivalent to the Mpioka Sub-group of Congo) emplaced between 635 and ca. 600 Ma. Thus sedimentation in the West-Congolian basin of SW-Gabon appears to have occurred over a period of about 300 Ma, and ended in response to compressional movements induced by the West Congolian orogenesis...|$|E
