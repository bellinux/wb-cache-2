As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory. [...] "And when I <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".|$|E
500|$|Mark and Kate {{broke up}} after Kate confessed to lying in her police {{statement}} during Paul's investigation. McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark {{did not stop}} loving Kate and that since he <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, the issue was not as [...] "black and white" [...] as he first thought. Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate {{and he did not}} like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to be something of a baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E

I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been {{keeping an eye on}} Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts".|$|E
