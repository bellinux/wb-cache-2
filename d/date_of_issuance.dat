40|$|Purpose - Numerous {{studies suggest}} that {{announcements}} of capital offerings cause abnormal price reaction in stock markets. However, despite extensive research, relevant studies on the property sector are still relatively scarce, {{especially in the case}} of Hong Kong. The determinants of the post-offering price effects, which vary across industries and regions, are yet to be identified. This paper aims to examine the abnormal stock return phenomenon of Hong Kong property developers and construction companies surrounding the announcement and offer <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>issuances.</b> Design/methodology/approach - It employs the event-study methodology and regression analysis to verify such effects. Findings - The major findings are: on equity offering announcements, there is a significant negative price reaction; the pre-offering debt/equity ratio of a firm is significantly associated with the level of abnormal price reactions; and on debt offerings there is, to the contrary, a modest increase in stock prices. Practical implications - This study has identified a set of determinants of the post-offering stock price effects. Originality/value - It can be concluded that there is evidence of abnormal price effects over the announcement and offer <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>issuances</b> with unique characteristics of the property and construction sectors in Hong Kong.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the possible inception of rational inflationary bubbles {{under the assumption}} that the empirically relevant environment precludes the existence of rational deflationary bubbles. The analysis shows that if a rational inflationary bubble exists, then it must have started on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> initial <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> the fiat money. Moreover, the existence of a rational inflationary bubble would imply that, prior to the initial <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> the fiat money, agents who anticipated its introduction expected a rational inflationary bubble to occur. The analysis also shows that once a rational inflationary bubble bursts it cannot restart. The analysis, however, does not preclude the existence of a rational inflationary bubble that shrinks periodically, but never bursts. The limitations on the inception and existence of rational inflationary bubbles also apply to rational exchange-rate bubbles. ...|$|R

F-test showed that the model of regression can be used for estimating audit delay. Examination of hypothesis indicated that age, education level, and type of client business did not have significant effect on audit delay, but experience had significant effect on audit delay.
