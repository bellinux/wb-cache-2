60|$|To such a {{spot and}} its {{surroundings}} {{the atmosphere of}} tradition and mystery was not wanting. Six years ago Boone Culpepper had built the house, and brought to it his wife--variously {{believed to be a}} gypsy, a Mexican, a bright mulatto, a Digger Indian, a South Sea princess from Tahiti, somebody else's wife--but in reality a little Creole woman from New Orleans, with whom he had contracted a marriage, with other gambling debts, during a winter's vacation from his home in Virginia. At the end of two years she had died, succumbing, as differently stated, from perpetual wet feet, or the misanthropic idiosyncrasies of her husband, and leaving behind her a girl of twelve and a boy of sixteen to console him. How futile was this bequest may be guessed from a brief summary of Mr. Culpepper's peculiarities. They were the development of a singular form of aggrandizement and misanthropy. On his arrival at Logport he had bought a part of the apparently valueless Dedlow Marsh from the Government at less than a dollar an acre, continuing his singular investment year by year until he was the owner of three leagues of amphibious domain. It was then discovered that this property carried with it the WATER FRONT of divers valuable and convenient sites for manufactures and the commercial ports of a noble bay, as well as the natural embarcaderos of some 'lumbering' inland settlements. Boone Culpepper would not sell. Boone Culpepper would not rent or lease. Boone Culpepper held an invincible blockade of his neighbors, and the progress and improvement he despised--granting only, after a royal fashion, occasional license, revocable at pleasure, in the shape of tolls, which amply supported him, with the game he shot in his kingfisher's eyrie on the Marsh. Even the Government that had made him powerful was obliged to 'condemn' a part of his property at an <b>equitable</b> <b>price</b> for the purposes of Fort Redwood, in which the adjacent town of Logport shared. And Boone Culpepper, unable to resist the act, refused to receive the compensation or quit-claim the town. In his scant intercourse with his neighbors he always alluded to it as his own, showed it to his children as part of their strange inheritance, and exhibited the starry flag that floated from the Fort as a flaunting insult to their youthful eyes. Hated, feared, and superstitiously shunned by some, regarded as a madman by others, familiarly known as 'The Kingfisher of Dedlow,' Boone Culpepper was one day found floating dead in his skiff, with a charge of shot through his head and shoulders. The shot-gun lying at his feet {{at the bottom of the}} boat indicated the 'accident' as recorded in the verdict of the coroner's jury--but not by the people. A thousand rumors of murder or suicide prevailed, but always with the universal rider, 'Served him right.' So invincible was this feeling that but few attended his last rites, which took place at high water. The delay of the officiating clergyman lost the tide; the homely catafalque--his own boat--was left aground on the Marsh, and deserted by all mourners except the two children. Whatever he had instilled into them by precept and example, whatever took place that night in their lonely watch by his bier on the black marshes, it was certain that those who confidently looked for any change in the administration of the Dedlow Marsh were cruelly mistaken. The old Kingfisher was dead, but he had left in the nest two young birds, more beautiful and graceful, it was true, yet as fierce and tenacious of beak and talon.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been set up to {{investigate}} the division of the consumer’s dollar between the primary producer and the dealer as a basis for setting an <b>equitable</b> <b>price</b> to the farmer. During and after the depression years economists in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics took a great deal of interest in the division of the consumer’s dollar between the farm producer and the marketing system. Many economists assumed that the producer did not get an adequate share of the consumer’s dollar. If this is still true, the reason may be that the present pricing systems are complicated and vague and that they reflect superior bargaining advantage for the dealer. An effort will be made to assemble as much information as possible about the pricing plans now in use, how they operate, and what could be done to make the plans work more smoothly. In this study of pricing fluid milk it will be necessary for an investigation to be made of the collective bargaining involved in the setting of prices. The theoretical discussion of bargaining will be handled mainly from the position of the milk producers because the study is primarily interested in producers’ prices and pay plans. The dealer’s position in the bargaining process will be discussed from the theoretical standpoint, but there will be no detailed discussion of his position. The data on pricing plans, producer prices, volume of milk, retail prices and market organization, for the areas of Grand Island, Hastings, Norfolk, North Platte and Scottsbluff were obtained from interviews in the markets. In Grand Island, Hastings, and Norfolk the payroll records of producers were obtained from the cooperatives in these markets.

Tutkimuksen tulokset pohjautuvat vähittäismyymälöiltä kerättyyn kyselyaineistoon (n= 287) ja vähittäismyymälöiden hedelmä- ja vihannesosaston vastaavien (n= 15) sekä tukkukaupan edustajien (n= 3) haastatteluihin. Lomakekyselyn otokseen valittiin myymälöitä suurimmista päivittäistavarakaupan ketjuista siten, että edustettuna ovat automarket-, supermarket- ja market-myymälätyyppien myymälät. Vähittäismyymälöiden haastattelut suunnattiin super- ja au-tomarket-myymälöihin, ja aineisto painottuu pääkaupunkiseudulle. Tukkujen haastatteluissa haastateltiin Keskon, Inex Partnersin- ja Tuko Logisticsin edustajia. Vähittäiskaupan ruokaperunaostojen hankintakanavajakaumia selvitettiin sekä pakatun perunan että irtoperunatuoteryhmän osalta. Tutkimuksessa tehdyn lomakekyselyn mukaan suurin osa pakatusta perunasta tilataan keskusliikkeiden kautta (64 %). Suoraan viljelijöiltä myymälät tilaavat pakattua perunaa 22 %, vihannestukuilta 11 % ja pakkaamoilta 3 %. Irtoperunatuoteryhmässä myymälät tilaavat eniten suoraan viljelijöiltä (55 %). Keskusliikkeiden kautta myymälät tilaavat 24 %, vihannestukkujen 12 % ja pakkaamoiden 9 %. Vähittäismyymälöiden hedelmä- ja vihannesosaston vastaavien haastatteluissa tärkeimpinä hyvän tavarantoimittajan kriteereinä mainittiin tuotteiden tasalaatuisuus, toimitusvarmuus ja palvelu. Viljelijöiden ja pienempien perunantoimittajien vahvuutena vähittäismyymälöissä on laadun ohella erityisesti hyvä palvelu keskusliikkeiden tukkuihin verrattuna. Kyselyaineiston mukaan eniten kehitettävää tavarantoimittajasuhteessa on myynninedistämiseen liittyvissä osa-alueissa. Tarve kehittää ruokaperunan menekinedistämistyötä kävi ilmi myös vähittäismyymälöiden ja tukkujen edustajien haastatteluissa. Erityisesti hedelmä- ja vihannesosaston vastaavat toivoivat myynninedistämistoimenpiteisiin perunantoimittajilta aktiivisempaa otetta. Vähittäismyymälöihin toivottiin ruokaperunasta sellaista myynninedistämismateriaalia, joka selkeästi keskittyy erilaisiin teemoihin tai tapahtumiin. Tällaisen materiaalin avulla ruokaperunatuoteryhmää voitaisiin tuoda esille kokonaisuutena. Tukkujen edustajien haastatteluissa korostettiin tavarantoimittajasuhteen tärkeimpinä tekijöinä tuotteiden tasalaatuisuutta, tasaista hintapolitiikkaa, toimitusvarmuutta sekä avointa tiedonvaihtoa tuk-kujen ja perunantoimittajien välillä. Tukkujen edustajat toivoivat varhaisperunakaupan osalta entistä avoimempaa tiedon vaihtoa, erityisesti kotimaisen varhaisperunakauden alkamisajankohdasta. Keskusliikkeiden tiukentuva ketjuohjaus voi joidenkin vähittäismyymälöiden edustajien mukaan johtaa ruokaperunakaupan keskittymiseen keskusliikkeiden tukuille. Ruokaperunakaupan keskittymistä hidastanee kuitenkin super- ja automarkettien halu saada perunantoimittajalta palvelua.

The questionnaires were sent to the staff of fruit and vegetable departments of retail stores, while the data on the relationship between potato suppliers and traders were collected by 15 interviews of people wor-king in the fruit and vegetable departments of retail stores and 3 representatives of the wholesale sector. According to the questionnaires, the retail stores order 64 % of packed potatoes from wholesalers, 22 % directly from farmers, 11 % from vegetable wholesalers and 3 % from potato packing en-ter-prises. In the category of bulk potatoes, the retail stores order 55 % directly from farmers, 24 % from the central wholesalers, 12 % from vegetable wholesalers and 9 % from potato packing enterprises. On the basis of interviews at retail stores, the most important criteria in the potato supplier re-la-tionship are the uniform quality of potatoes, service, and reliable deliveries. According to this study, service is an important strength for potato farmers who deliver potatoes directly to retail stores. The quality of the potatoes is another essential strength of farmers. According to data obtained both through the questionnaires and interviews at retail stores, the element in the supplier relationship which mainly calls for development is sales promotion. The people working at the fruit and ve-ge-table departments consider that the suppliers should be more active in this, and the promotion material available at retail stores should concentrate on specific themes and events. The most important elements in the supplier relationship raised in the interviews of the rep-re-sentatives of wholesalers included the uniform quality of potatoes, <b>equitable</b> <b>price</b> policy, reliable deliveries and open exchange of information. Wholesalers wished for more open exchange of information especially on {{the beginning of the season}} for the domestic early potatoes. According to some representatives of retail traders, the control of the head offices over the retail chains and stores is getting tighter. Such trend might lead to the dominance of central wholesalers in potato trade. On the other hand, especially supermarkets and hypermarkets value the services provided by the potato farmers, which is likely to slow down the centralizing trend in the potato trade.

40|$|Abstract: Permanent water {{markets have}} now been in place in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria {{for a number of}} years. It is {{therefore}} possible to investigate whether the objectives of policy makers are being achieved or not. This paper investigates one of the objectives of water trading, to facilitate a re-allocation of water in a socially equitable way. The paper does that by comparing prices paid in the water market with the value of water when attached to irrigated farmland. The underlying philosophy applied to test this is that, in order to be socially <b>equitable,</b> <b>prices</b> paid in the water market have to equate the value of water when attached to irrigated farmland. If that is not the case, water sellers will erode the value of their property by more than they receive when they sell water. In all three States, it seems that sellers of water, not used to support water dependent farm investments, are being over compensated. That is, prices paid in the water markets well exceed the value of unused water attached to land. In Victoria, there is evidence to suggest that sellers of actively used water, are not being compensated-that is, the price paid in the market does not equate the value of water when attached to irrigated farmland. In South Australia, the findings are less clear. It is indicated that farmers with low quality plantings and irrigation systems, and using the water for citrus, are being compensated, while irrigators with better plantings and irrigation systems, using the water for vines and other horticultural crops, are not being compensated. In New South Wales, prices in the water market equate water value when attached to land, and thus compensate sellers of both used and unused water...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Food Connect (FC) is a food {{distribution}} company operating in Brisbane, Australia. Within the contemporary business paradigm {{it might be}} described as a company that is growing, to make a profit, receiving, packaging and distributing organic and eco-efficient food products to Brisbane's suburban homes. However, FC has brought together, through deliberate relationship, two significant and large systems; primary producer networks, and consumer networks. FC generates social and economic benefits into each system. The involved communities have identified a range of values, principles and concepts that inform the structures and decision making across many scales of practice. These enable a community owned and managed business structure to meet social, environmental, economic, education, health and wellbeing goals for individuals, households, farming systems, the environment and our localised economies. Quality of food, reliability of supply, value of supplied food and opportunity for enhanced social and community relationships are all benefits derived by consumer groups, while producer groups gain reliability and predictability of income, enjoy enhanced and direct feedback from discerning consumers and participate in local and extended communities. It is spiritual, practical, ethical and profitable. FC's existence can be understood as a set of political aims about the relationships between urban communities and primary producers; the treatment of animals and the environment; workplace relations; and the spiritual and ideological importance of clean, nutritious, quality food produce at accessible and <b>equitable</b> <b>prices.</b> However a threat to the achievement of these aims is patriarchy and associated positivist behavioural and social science ideologies, despite FC's development based on systems thinking. Defined gender role stereotyping, sexist assumptions and oppression of women in the workplace, prevail in all sectors of Australian culture and society. If reflective and purposeful processes to value and encourage the effective and safe participation of women is not fostered throughout FC's systems, FC is not likely to achieve its potential. Eco-feminist goals suggest that it is imperative for local communities to harness and engage the responsiveness and energy of women to ensure social and ecological diversities survive. A merging of systems theory and non-assumptive, eco-feminist critique of the patterns and contexts, will reveal the prevalence of patriarchy which may be undermining FC's systems, and make suggestions as to how FC can use the knowledge generated from the evaluation. Feminist engagement in FC's continued evolution ought create future actions aligned with democratic, participatory and communitarian principles. This is a practical, real world example of systems and feminist theories grounding action in and for community wellbeing. Our experience has shown that a deliberate (eco) systems based process do not negate gendered structures and practices...|$|R

The use of the tolled road depends on the user's level of income. Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worse off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. Road space rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more <b>equitable</b> than congestion <b>pricing.</b> However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site) are relatively more impacted.|$|R

In an attempt {{to contribute to the}} use of efficient, <b>equitable,</b> and revenue-sufficient <b>pricing,</b> this paper estimates the long-run marginal and average social costs of water supply in Mekelle city using a multi-product translog cost function that incorporates the shadow price of natural water. Findings show that the marginal social costs of providing one m 3 of residential and non-residential water are Birr 5. 33 and 7. 71 (Birr = Ethiopian currency: 1 Euro ≈ 23 Birr), respectively, while the average current prices are Birr 4. 46 and 6. 10 /m 3. On the other hand, the average social costs of residential and non-residential water are estimated at Birr 14. 34 and 16. 36 /m 3, respectively, implying that marginal social cost-based prices would still lead to a revenue deficit of approximately Birr 9 /m 3. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{bursting}} of {{the internet}} bubble continues to have ripple effects on the initial public offering (IPO) process. Critics of this process have fashioned {{a complex set of}} interconnected objections to the orthodox bookbuilding method for conducting IPOs, pricing shares, and allocating them to preferred investors. Critics instead hail online reverse-bid, or Dutch, auctions (Dutch IPOs) as an alternative method promising more <b>equitable</b> access, efficient <b>prices,</b> and egalitarian allocations. This article comprehensively assesses the case for Dutch IPOs. Part I dissects critiques of bookbuilding, which rely on anomalous data, derogate established financial literature, and largely evaporate in the face of recent regulations. Part II examines the empirical performance of Dutch IPOs, which have failed to distinguish themselves in the United States and around the world. Part III reveals ways in which Dutch IPOs may be susceptible to fraud and manipulation that bookbuilding is not. Ultimately, claims of the Dutch IPO's superiority over bookbuilding are unproven at best and at worst fail to appreciate certain risks...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the {{assumptions}} that world oil resources are finite and that world oil production will peak sometime in the 1980 s or 1990 s (Hughes & Mesarovic 1978 : 139). Such a scenario is now widely accepted and is robust to alternative assumptions on oil prices and reserves. Increases in the real world price of oil are therefore likely to occur. Because of New Zealand's almost complete dependence on imported oil for liquid fuel purposes and New Zealand's continuing balance of payments problems, the situation could become serious for New Zealand resulting in policies designed to reduce use of oil based fuels, such as substantial domestic fuel price increases, or government regulation of fuel use, such as rationing. This paper attempts to give an indication of the implications that an oil price rise could have for New Zealand agriculture. A large part of the paper is concerned with transport, since the transport industry is the largest user of liquid fuels in New Zealand. The paper concentrates on the effects of fuel price rises as opposed to physical rationing of liquid fuels. In describing the potential effects of fuel price rises, particular attention has been given to how farm costs and farm product prices may be affected by fuel price increases. Most attention is given to effects on and responses from the farm production sector of agriculture, although some consideration is also given to the agricultural freight and product processing sectors. Some brief comments are also made on the demand for transport in rural areas so that <b>equitable</b> fuel <b>pricing</b> or rationing systems can be devised and implemented if, and when, necessary...|$|R

Critics of this process have woven {{a complex set of}} interconnected objections to the orthodox method for conducting IPOs, pricing of shares, and allocating them to preferred investors. These critics instead point to online auctions as an alternative IPO method that can provide more <b>equitable</b> access, efficient <b>prices,</b> and egalitarian allocations. These claims rest on Google’s recent IPO and W. R. Hambrecht + Co. ’s OpenIPO mechanism, conventionally regarded as impure variants of what is known as a descending-bid or Dutch auction (Dutch IPO). This article assesses the empirical and theoretical case for Dutch IPOs. Google’s IPO featured peculiarities that delimit its utility as a case study. Instead this article novelly presents underpricing data on all OpenIPOs, as well as data about a French variant known as the Mise en Vente. The results fail to vindicate Dutch IPO supporters’ primary claims, which perilously rely upon observations from the anomalous two-year internet bubble period. Moreover, economic and financial analyses of Dutch IPOs reveal ways in which they may be susceptible to fraud that bookbuilding is not.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that price incentives {{can be used to}} encourage water conservation in residential consumers. Conservation water rates are designed to send price signals that encourage households to reduce discretionary water use in the long term. However, it is not always clear that conservation rates effectively provide meaningful incentives. Utilities themselves may also not have strong incentives to implement conservation rates. If conservation rates {{have a negative impact on}} revenue, or if they lead to increased revenue variability, utilities may have a disincentive to use them. In addition, block pricing structures (where unit water rate increases with water usage) may be inequitable, in the sense that the “revenue burden” is borne disproportionately by some customer groups. This may make some rate structures unpopular with consumers and politically unfeasible. Because there is no consensus about what defines conservation rates, they take many forms. In Florida, the two most common are: uniform rates- where customers pay a set fee for each unit of water used, and inclining block rates- where the price per unit becomes progressively higher. Empirical evidence about the incentives provided by various structures is limited. This research has three main objectives. The first is to analyze whether or not the number of price blocks affects the conservation incentives faced by residential consumers. The second is to test for statistical evidence that rate structure effects revenue variability. And, the third is to analyze the impact of different rate structures on consumer equity. Secondary data from sixteen Florida utilities are used to meet the objectives of the study. The sample was originally chosen by Dr. John Whitcomb as a part of his study Florida Water Rates Evaluation of Single-Family Homes (2005). Whitcomb (2005) includes rate information, customer survey results, and empirical data on actual water use for 7, 200 households from 1998 to 2003. For the first objective, a descriptive analysis of rate structures is used. Household reductions in water use are compared to corresponding reductions in water bills for all rate structure periods. Larger reductions in corresponding bills indicate stronger conservation price signals. Distribution of utility revenues between volumetric and fixed water and wastewater charges is also examined, and larger share of volumetric charges is linked to a stronger conservation price signal. The second part of the study uses graphical analysis and a simple OLS model to examine rate structure and revenue variability. For the third objective, Gini coefficients and Lorenz curves were used, following Morgan (1987). Households are divided into income groups and usage groups. Gini Coefficients are calculated based on these groups. Lower coefficients indicate a more equitable rate structure. The results indicate that the conservation price signals are strongest for inclining block structures with more than three price blocks. Block structures with three or less price blocks do not send stronger price signals than uniform rate structures. In some cases, the price incentive to reduce water consumption by 40 % was stronger for uniform structures than for inclining block structures with three blocks. Within the sample, the price incentive is strongest for inclining block structures with more than three price blocks. Alternatively, the utility revenue distribution results suggest that the number of price blocks is not necessarily a good indicator of how conservation oriented a rate structure is. In several cases, the percentage of revenue from volumetric sources was higher for uniform structures than for block structures. Analysis for objectives two and three will be completed in October 2009. Preliminary results for objective two provide evidence that revenue variability could be a significant disincentive for utilities to adopt conservation rates. While there was no statistical evidence that overall revenue is affected by changes in rate structure, there is some evidence that utility revenue streams are more variable for block structures than for uniform structures. Preliminary objective three results suggest that customer equity is not adversely affected by conservation rates. When divided into income groups, the estimated Gini coefficients for uniform and inclining block rate structures were similar and close to zero, indicating <b>equitable</b> <b>pricing.</b> Conservation, water, price, revenue, equity, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

An increasing number of countries have reorganized their public service sectors in order to achieve greater competition, efficiency, quality of service and affordable pricing. 2 Many of these reforms have focused on the telecommunications and energy (electricity and natural gas) sectors. A common element in these reforms is the creation of distinctive institutions for each of the following functions: policy-making, commercial operations and regulation.
