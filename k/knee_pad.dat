40|$|Although {{football}} {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) {{has developed}} considerably since the game 2 ̆ 7 s conception, <b>knee</b> <b>pad</b> design has lagged behind.

This research first created a new <b>knee</b> <b>pad</b> design based on survey feedback from 138 collegiate and high school football athletes. This new design, called the Vastus And Patella Protection with Range of motion (VAPPR) pad, was then tested for effectiveness. During testing, 10 collegiate athletes performed standardized football drills (Pro-Agility, L-Drill, Broad-Jump) under three padded conditions: unpadded, standard <b>knee</b> <b>pad,</b> VAPPR pad. Results were based on three padded comparisons. First, athletes performed at a higher level unpadded than wearing standard knee pads. Second, no difference in performance existed between testing unpadded and with VAPPR pads. Third, VAPPR pads resulted in superior performance, provided equal protection, and were preferred by athletes when compared to standard knee pads...|$|E

A penetration shot is a very common movement in the sport and one that is regularly practiced during a training session.

This study was completed in the Biomechanics Lab and involved video tracking of markers on the right leg and a force platform to measure knee impact forces. A cushioned mat was placed over the force platform and participants were asked to perform a penetration shot with the knee striking over the force platform.

40|$|The {{meniscus}} {{is important}} in many aspects of knee function. The placement of meniscus where been located between the two bones of femur and tibia gives an advantage towards the knee joint. It is when the load been transmitted across the joint {{in order to give}} maximal congruency towards the joint. This study will focuses on two objectives which are to observe the effects towards the knee joint which having various cases of meniscus and also to observe the functionality of the meniscus which is wedges in shape. The method used in this study is a simulation of knee joint which is consisting of three main parts, femur, tibia and meniscus. In order to observe what the effects towards the knee joint, various cases is being simulated which are knee joint with healthy meniscus compared with knee joint with various of torn meniscus and a simulation of full leg with and without <b>knee</b> <b>pad</b> with existence of external impact. The boundary condition of force parameter is calculated from the ball velocity after being kicked where the comparison between the two types of kicking result with instep kicking got high impact force and distributed force than inside kicking. The highest distributed force then is used for the simulation. Simulation result shows that a healthy meniscus transmits load across the joint in a uniform state within the range of 0. 3 MPa and 0. 4 MPa. For torn meniscus, the result shows that it is failed to transmit the load across the joint. Thus an excessive stress is recorded {{across the surface of the}} tibia. The highest stress recorded is 0. 5 MPa. For second simulation, 1000 N is used as an external force exerted to the leg surface. Result shows that the external force applied on the surface of the leg will give an effect towards the internal part of the knee joint where causing the knee joint to bend and meniscus to be compressed. Comparison between the full leg with and without <b>knee</b> <b>pad</b> shows that full leg without <b>knee</b> <b>pad</b> is having large of knee joint bending and meniscus be compressed more than full leg with <b>knee</b> <b>pad.</b> From these to simulation, an observation can be made where the placement of the meniscus between the femur and tibia is to maintain the congruency between the bones and to prevent an excessive stress happen to the joint...|$|E
