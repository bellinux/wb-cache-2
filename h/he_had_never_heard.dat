5|$|Despite {{not having}} listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 {{in favor of}} new wave, Kijak was {{immediately}} drawn to the band's music, surprised <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> it before. He bonded {{with some of the}} band members; learning that Kiss' Love Gun was the first album he, Yoshiki and Toshi had ever bought and talking with Sugizo about the British new wave band Japan and its bassist Mick Karn, who was a friend of the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally {{and would have to}} leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
25|$|At Simcha Zissel's funeral, {{his friend}} and {{colleague}} Rabbi Eliezer Gordon, the Rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva of Telz, said that aside from Simcha Zissel’s greatness in Torah, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> a single word from him that {{was not related to}} Torah and to fear of Heaven.|$|E
50|$|Beowulf {{says that}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> {{of anyone else}} having such a great sea-fight as he had; and then adds {{particularly}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> such stories told of Unferth, {{and in fact the}} story people tell about Unferth is how he killed his brothers, for which, Beowulf predicts, Unferth will be tormented in Hell despite his cleverness. Unferth silently concedes defeat and the feast continues.|$|R

25|$|In 1993, Hovind {{announced}} that he would be debating the renowned evolutionary biologist, Stephen Jay Gould, who had a longstanding opposition to debating Creationists and had turned down numerous challenges. When contacted about the announcement, Gould said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Hovind, much less agreed to debate.|$|E
25|$|Heifetz visited much of Europe {{while still}} in his teens. In April 1911, Heifetz {{performed}} in an outdoor concert in St. Petersburg before 25,000 spectators; {{there was such a}} sensational reaction that police officers needed to protect the young violinist after the concert. In 1914, he performed with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikisch. The conductor was very impressed, saying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> such an excellent violinist.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, Davis married artist William Grant Sherry, {{who also}} {{worked as a}} masseur. She had been drawn {{to him because he}} claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of her and was, therefore, not intimidated by her. The same year, Davis refused the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), a role for which Joan Crawford won an Academy Award, and instead made The Corn Is Green (1945) based on a play by Emlyn Williams.|$|E

50|$|The {{album was}} deleted from the Warner Bros {{catalogue}} in 2003, and reissued through Rhino Entertainment's Encore imprint in June 2008. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine in January 2008, Bob Mould stated that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> this album.|$|R
25|$|ESPN {{reported}} in 2007, that in 2003 and 2004 Schoeneweis received six steroid shipments from Signature Pharmacy while {{playing for the}} Chicago White Sox. Schoeneweis denied the report, and told the New York Daily News that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Signature Pharmacy or received shipments from Florida.|$|R
25|$|UKIP {{has several}} {{high-profile}} backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then {{expelled from the}} Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave £25,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from £100,000 to £1 million after Hague said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of him. The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over £1 million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Jesper Strömblad formed In Flames {{to write}} music that {{combined}} the melodic guitar style of Iron Maiden with {{the brutality of}} death metal, something which Jesper stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> any band do. In writing songs, Jesper also decided {{to make use of}} keyboards, something which was (at the time) uncommon in death metal. Ever since In Flames' debut studio album, Lunar Strain, the band has made use of keyboards. Despite their sometimes heavy use of keyboards in their music, they still refuse to recruit a full-time keyboardist.|$|E
25|$|The first witness called was Edward N. Trump, a {{mechanical}} and chemical engineer, who is {{general manager of}} the Solvay Process Company. He reported that Wilkinson was hired by the men composing the New York Automobile Company to develop an automobile. The machine that Wilkinson showed to him was cooled by air, instead of a water jacket. Up to that time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of an air-cooled automobile. The machine had four-cylinders and gasoline was the fuel used. Wilkinson afterward developed an improved machine, which was made for the New York Automobile Company at the plant of the Straight Line Engine Company.|$|E
50|$|He is {{described}} as reserved, polite and modest, contrary to his character on TV. Wakabayashi <b>has</b> said <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> Kasuga speaking bad about others. Mikio Date, a member of owarai duo Sandwichman has also said Kasuga had neither spoken ill of others nor agreed with other comedians' bad comments on others at their joint live rehearsals.|$|R
50|$|The sketch {{begins with}} Cheech {{at the piano}} {{attempting}} to write a parody of “¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?” (Spanish for Where is Santa Claus?) a Christmas song by Augie Rios from 1958, to little success.

5000|$|In Buddhism, all souls, whether evangelized or not, will {{continue}} to be reincarnated until they have achieved Nirvana. However, Buddhist scholars have said that [...] "any suggestion that enlightenment is immediately available to anyone who really wants it, even if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Buddhism, is likely to be received with incredulity or even resentment." ...|$|R
25|$|Author and First Fleet officer Watkin Tench, whose {{accounts}} are primary sources {{about the early}} years of the colony, suggested that the epidemic may have been caused by Aborigines disturbing the grave of a French sailor who died shortly after arrival in Australia and had been buried at Botany Bay. However, in his memoir A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales", Tench wrote that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the existence of smallpox among the French sailors. Another intriguing possibility mentioned by Tench was that, as the colony's physicians had brought bottles of smallpox-infected material with them from England for use in inoculation against smallpox.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall. The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of such a demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, {{and that it would}} be a terrible shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
25|$|However, on 17 March 1998, Stoltenberg {{was called}} to give {{testimony}} in the case. He told the Oslo District Court, under oath, that he was unfamiliar with the artificial inflating of membership figures {{which took place in}} the AUF. He also told the court that he was unaware of any form of fraud taking place in the organisation under his leadership, and stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of 'advancing' money to pay for memberships until Verdens Gang broke the story on 2 March 1995. He also stated that in his opinion, it was not necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for members, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the main}} duo {{interact}} with various other characters {{over the course}} of the series, the only supporting character to appear in more than one episode is Barry, a plumber who dresses like Super Mario and is nicknamed [...] "Super Barrio" [...] by Jacky and Tony (though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the character and doesn't understand the joke). Barry is played by Tom Urie.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{the manager}} is upset and confused, more so since <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> {{of the reality}} show [...] "Chor, Chor, Super Chor".

5000|$|Seven (Seán Cullen): The {{youngest}} and tallest {{member of}} the family. Seven {{has the ability to}} unscrew his head. Despite his frightening appearance, he is the most gentle and timid monster and is afraid of bugs.

25|$|The {{naming of}} the bridge for Verrazzano was controversial. It was first {{proposed}} in 1951 by the Italian Historical Society of America, when the bridge was in the planning stage. After Robert Moses turned down the initial proposal, the society undertook a public relations campaign to re-establish {{the reputation of the}} largely forgotten Verrazzano and to promote the idea of naming the bridge for him. The campaign was largely the effort of Society director John N. LaCorte, who in 1954 successfully lobbied New York Governor W.Averell Harriman to proclaim April 17 (the anniversary of Verrazzano's arrival in the harbor) as Verrazzano Day. Subsequent efforts by LaCorte resulted in similar proclamations by governors of states along the East Coast. After these successes, LaCorte reapproached the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, but was turned down a second time. The manager of the authority, backed by Moses, said the name was too long and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Verrazzano.|$|E
25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{success of his}} third book of verse, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred after he published 77 Dream Songs in 1964. It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing {{as one of the}} most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon afterwards, Berryman started receiving a great deal of national attention from the press, from arts organizations, and even from the White House which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman had to decline because he was in Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him. Also, that year the newly created National Endowment for the Arts awarded him a ten thousand dollar grant (though he admitted, when asked about the award by a Minneapolis reporter, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the organization before).|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} of 1204, Baudolino of Alessandria enters Constantinople, unaware of the Fourth Crusade that has thrown the city into chaos. In the confusion, he meets Niketas Choniates and saves his life. Niketas is amazed by his {{language}} genius, speaking many languages <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard,</b> and on the question: {{if he is not}} part of the crusade, who is he? Baudolino begins to recount his life story to Niketas.|$|R

50|$|As {{the other}} patrons leave the diner, they learn from an {{officer on the}} road that the road is closed again, because of a most serious car accident. They come to know that Nick was {{involved}} in the crash, which killed him instantly. He also reveals that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of a Police Officer called 'Deville'. Then Kayla realizes that Deville was actually the Devil in disguise based on the pronunciation of his surname.|$|R
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

500|$|New York {{art gallery}} owner Edward Winkleman wrote in 2006 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the Stuckists, so he [...] "looked {{them up on}} Wikipedia", and stated he was [...] "turned off by their anti-conceptual stance, {{not to mention the}} inanity of their {{statement}} about painting, but I'm more than a bit interested in the democratization their movement represents." [...] Thomson responded to Winkleman directly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not {{so strange}} when I explain,' Stephen hastened to say. 'It was done in this way--by letter.
