40|$|Rainfall is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of slope failure. The variation in stress state of soils due to rise of groundwater level and seepage of groundwater is critical to the deformation and failure of slopes during and after heavy rainfall. The stability of fill slope depends not only on the strength of fill material but also the drainage condition of the slope. Proper <b>drainage</b> <b>control</b> can not only limit the height of groundwater level, but also dissipate the build-up of excess pore pressure caused by shearing-induced contraction of soil. The possibility of liquefaction and flow failure of fill slope can be reduced consequently. The performance of compacted fill slope during rise of groundwater level is investigated by using a fully coupled procedure and the state-dependent dilatancy sand model. The interaction between pore water and soil skeleton including both buoyancy and seepage effects can be precisely taken into account in a fully coupled effective stress approach. The influence of the drainage condition of compacted fill on the stability of slope is examined.

Long-term simulations with DRAINMOD-NII indicated that drainage design and/or management practices proposed as alternatives to conventional design may offer opportunities to reduce nitrate (NO 3) -nitrogen losses without significantly decreasing (and in some cases, increasing) crop yields for a Webster silty clay loam soil at Waseca, Minnesota.
