The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to}} be camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents {{for about a week}} after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E

25|$|Incubation lasts between 22 and 26 days, {{and begins}} after laying the first egg, {{although}} it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid. This means the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often {{at least one parent}} remains with them, until they fledge, to guard them. Both parents feed the chicks, although early on in the rearing period, the male <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding.|$|E
25|$|Mated pairs produce one {{to three}} eggs per year, laid two to five days apart in March or April and {{incubated}} for 38 days by both parents. Once hatched, chicks are quite tolerant of one another, although the first hatched is often larger and dominates at feeding times. The female <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the brooding and direct feeding, with the male taking over now and then. Young are able to feed themselves from five to six weeks and they fledge at eleven to twelve weeks, remaining {{in the vicinity of}} the nest, dependent on their parents for a further six to ten weeks. The sex of nestlings can be identified using field methods, or using DNA.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stage of the colony founding, the queen Vespula vulgaris <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the work, both {{building}} and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during {{the very beginning of}} the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.|$|E
25|$|The Manx shearwater, {{like many}} other seabirds, visits its {{breeding}} colonies at night to reduce the chances of attack by aerial predators. Two aspects of its optical structure suggest that the eye of this species is adapted to vision at night. In the shearwater's eyes the lens <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relative flat and so of low refractive power. In a diurnal bird like the pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ratio of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon; the figure for the shearwater is consistent with that {{for a range of}} nocturnal birds and mammals.|$|E

Mary <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

500|$|Using an {{unofficial}} nickname of [...] "The River City", Jacksonville has a culture {{centered on the}} St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Juniper {{controlled}} {{one-third of}} the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales. According to BusinessWeek, [...] "analysts unanimously agree that Juniper's boxes [...] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds." [...] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position. The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a [...] "David versus Goliath" [...] story. Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the [...] "anti-Cisco" [...] for being a small company with a narrow focus.|$|E

500|$|As {{the tenth}} Disney Princess, several critics have drawn {{comparisons}} between Rapunzel and preceding Disney Princesses and animated heroines, {{the most frequent}} and prominent of whom remains Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989). The Daily News' Joe Neumaier likened Rapunzel's independence to that of Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991), writing, [...] "thoroughly modern Rapunzel <b>does</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the saving". Jonathan Crocker of Total Film noted similarities between Rapunzel and Ariel, describing Rapunzel as [...] "A strong-willed heroine longing to see outside." [...] Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune commented on Rapunzel's innocence, describing it as [...] "reminiscent of Amy Adams' flighty Giselle from ... Enchanted." [...] LoveFilm's Tom Charity commented on the character's independence, likening Rapunzel's spirited personality to those of both Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and the title character of Mulan (1998). Charity also labeled Rapunzel [...] "another addition to the more recent Disney tradition of emancipated heroines".|$|E
