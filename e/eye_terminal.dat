40|$|Surgical {{ablation}} of {{a single}} tectal lobe in Rana pipiens can cause regenerating retinal ganglion cell axons to cross to the remaining tectum. These synaptically deprived fibers can obtain termination space in a retinotopic and highly stereotyped manner. Each of the two eyes can share the undisturbed tectum by terminating in mutually exclusive, eye-specific stripes that alternate across the medial-lateral extent of the tectal lobe. Invading axons from the ipsilateral eye must actively displace established synapses from the contralateral eye in order to form these exclusive termination zones because the normal projection to the intact tectum is not severed in these experiments. In animals in which {{a large proportion of}} anomalous fibers do not reach the undisturbed tectum, only a few ipsilateral eye bands are observed. Nevertheless, these bands have the same width, periodicity, and orientation as those observed in fully banded preparations. When ipsilateral <b>eye</b> <b>terminal</b> density is extremely low, banding is absent. The completely striped termination pattern of unitectal animals is identical to the pattern previously reported in the dually innervated tecta of three-eyed R. pipiens. We theorize that this pattern results from a compromise between two synaptogenic forces that are active in regeneration as well as in development...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the morphologic development and the swimming and feeding behaviors of piracanjuba larvae, Brycon orbignyanus Valenciennes (1849) (Characiformes, Characidae, Bryconinae), {{during the period from}} zero to 172 hours after hatching (standard length = 3. 62 - 11. 94 mm). The morphological analyses were accomplished by using a trinocular stereo microscope, while the behavioral analyses were performed through periodic observations. In 28 hours after hatching, the larvae (standard length = 6. 25 ± 0. 13 mm) showed the following structural and behavioral characteristics that made them become active predators able to overcome a larval critical phase, the beginning of exogenous feeding: presence of pigmented <b>eyes,</b> <b>terminal</b> and wide mouth, developed oral dentition, developing digestive tube, yolk sac reduction, fins and swim bladder formation, horizontal swimming, cannibalism, and predation. Intense cannibalism among larvae was verified from 26 to 72 hours. At the end of the metamorphosis - 172 hours after hatching - the larvae measuring 11. 94 + 0. 80 mm in standard length presented a flexed notochord, caudal fin bifurcation, dorsal and anal fin formation, synchronized movements, and formation of shoals, characteristics that together allow enhanced perception and locomotio in exploration of the environment, determining the best moment for transfering to the fishponds. New studies can contribute to commercial fish farming by improving feeding management, performance, survival, and productivity of this species...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} initial atrophy of ciliary body in {{patients}} with painful terminal glaucoma using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and the progression of ciliary body atrophy following transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) considering total laser energy used. Materials and methods. 56 patients (92 <b>eyes)</b> with <b>terminal</b> painful glaucoma were examined. In these patients, TSCPC with total laser energy ranged from 43. 2 to 86. 4 mJ was performed. Total laser energy parameters for TSCPC were determined {{according to the presence}} and degree of ciliary body atrophy of the affected eye as compared with healthy one. Additionally, 5 <b>terminal</b> glaucoma <b>eyes</b> with clinically apparent eye globe sub-atrophy following previous TSCPC with total laser energy above the level used in this study were examined. Results. In all terminal glaucoma patients, various degrees of ciliary body atrophy was revealed using UBM. This atrophy was diagnosed by ciliary body thinning as compared with healthy eye by 28. 37 %. Post-op reaction degree following TSCPC depends on total laser energy. Total laser energy parameters selection depending on initial ciliary body atrophy reduces pain syndrome, minimizes post-op complications, prevents further ciliary body atrophy progression and decrease IOP to sub-compensated level. Conclusion. Mathematical analysis of ciliary body thickness changes depending on laser energy used was assumed as a basis of nomogram construction that provides individual calculation of maximum allowable and minimally required total laser energy. </p...|$|R

Terminals of this type disappeared 30 days after enucleation of the contralateral <b>eye.</b> Retinal <b>terminal</b> presynaptic profiles were characterized by (1) round and oval synaptic vesicles; (2) mitochondria with irregular, randomly oriented cristae, large intracristal spaces, dilated membrane spaces, and primarily light matrices; (3) a wide range in profile area, 0. 06 – 6. 82 Μm 2; (4) large numbers of synaptic vesicles per profile area 168 ± 33 synaptic vesicles per Μm 2; (5) asymmetric synapses; and (6) multiple synaptic contacts (1. 46 ± 0. 73 per terminal profile). The postsynaptic elements included both dendritic and, less commonly, pleomorphic vesicle-containing profiles. The majority of postsynaptic dendritic profiles were small (0. 01 – 0. 40 Μm 2). Serial synaptic contacts were occasionally seen. The combination of vesicular and mitochondrial morphology (1 and 2 above) was necessary and sufficient to establish the retinal origin of a terminal, but use of such criteria would underestimate the number of retinotectal terminals by omitting those which did not have a mitochondrion in the plane of section. The number of such terminals was calculated from independent measurements, and the total number of retinal terminal profiles per area of neuropil was estimated...|$|R

40|$|Vertebrate extraocular muscles show {{a highly}} complex anatomy, which differs {{in many respects}} from {{skeletal}} muscles. Furthermore, there is a considerable variation among different species {{with regard to the}} presence of proprioceptive organs. Whereas muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs are well developed in sheep and pig, neither are found in cat, and only poorly developed muscle spindles are present in human and monkey. In all vertebrates studied so far cuffs of nerve terminals around multiply innervated muscle fibers of the global layer, termed palisade endings (PE) are present at the myotendinous junction. Palisade endings (PE) are specialized nerve endings unique to extraocular muscles. There is still an ongoing debate on PE function. A proprioceptive function is supported by their ultrastructural morphology, and the location of the majority of their terminals within the muscle tendon. A motor function of PEs is suggested by the expression of different cholinergic markers, and the binding of α-bungarotoxin to at least a small proportion of PE nerve endings. So far the location of the somata giving rise to the PEs is unknown. After eye muscle injections with different tracers, and the investigation of retrogradely labeled cells after three days of survival, there are two possible options for the location of the cell bodies of PEs: The trigeminal ganglion (TG), where almost all of the sensory afferents of eye muscles come from, or the motor neurons of the abducens (nVI), trochlear (nIV) and oculomotor nucleus (nIII) in the brainstem, where the motor neurons of the extraocular muscles are situated. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the histochemical and morphometric properties of TG cells projecting to the extraocular muscles were studied and related to different nerve fibers and terminals in these muscles, to obtain more information about their function. Retrogradely labeled TG neurons and <b>eye</b> muscle <b>terminals</b> were processed for the presence of substance P (SP), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), calretinin (CR) and cholinacetyltransferase (ChAT). Injections of the tracer were placed into the medial rectus (MR) or the lateral recuts muscle (LR), either in the belly or in the distal, myotendinous part of the muscle. PEs were only labeled by CR or ChAT and none of the other markers that were used. Furthermore, CR positive retrogradely labeled tracer cells in the TG were rarely found (under 1...|$|R
40|$|Microvessels -blood vessels with {{diameter}} {{less than}} 200 microns- form large, intricate networks organized into arterioles, capillaries and venules. In these networks, {{the distribution of}} flow and pressure drop is a highly interlaced function of single vessel resistances and mutual vessel interactions. In this {{paper we propose a}} mathematical and computational model to study the behavior of microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network geometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one representing a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single vessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized Ohm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross section area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads. The membrane theory is used to describe the deformation of vessel lumina, tailored to the structure of thick-walled arterioles and thin-walled venules. In addition, since venules can possibly experience negative transmural pressures, a buckling model is also included to represent vessel collapse. The complete model including arterioles, capillaries and venules represents a nonlinear system of PDEs, which is approached numerically by finite element discretization and linearization techniques. We use the model to simulate flow in the microcirculation of the human <b>eye</b> retina, a <b>terminal</b> system with a single inlet and outlet. After a phase of validation against experimental measurements, we simulate the network response to different interstitial pressure values. Such a study is carried out both for global and localized variations of the interstitial pressure. In both cases, significant redistributions of the blood flow in the network arise, highlighting the importance of considering the single vessel behavior along with its position and connectivity in the network...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To perform immune {{mapping of}} the {{peripheral}} part of visual analyzer and optic nerve {{in order to}} identify potential antigenic targets of autoimmune attack. Methods. <b>Eyes</b> enucleated for <b>terminal</b> painful glaucoma (n = 30) were studied. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of isolated retina and optic nerve using a broad panel of antibodies, i. e., monoclonal murine anti-MBP (myelin basic protein) antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-alpha fodrin antibodies, monoclonal murine anti-NSE 2 (neuron-specific enolase) antibodies, monoclonal murine anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and polyclonal rabbit anti-S 100 antibodies. IHC reaction was visualized using Mouse and Rabbit Specific HRP / AEC Detection IHC Kit. IHC reaction without primary antibodies included was a negative control. IHC reaction was considered as follows: negative — no specific cellular staining or less than 10 % of cells are stained; mild — 10 ‑ 30 % of cells are stained (+); moderate — 30 ‑ 75 % of cells are stained (++); marked — more than 75 % of cells are stained (+++); overexpression — 100 % of cells intensively express markers. Additionally, staining intensity was considered as mild (+ 1), moderate (+ 2), strong (+ 3) and intense (+ 4). Results. Immune mapping with a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies identified ocular structures which were stained with IHC markers. Retina was stained with almost all markers of neural differentiation (i. e., antibodies against NSE, GFAP, S 100, and α-fodrin) excepting anti-MBP autoantibodies.  IHC reaction intensity in retinal layers and structures varied and depended on markers. Moderate (2 +) staining with antibodies against MBP, NSE, GFAP, and S 100 and marked (3 +) staining with antibodies against alpha-fodrin was detected in the cytoplasm of optic nerve glia. Conclusion. Complete labelling of retina structures was performed. As a result, IHC profiles of retinal neurons, optic nerve axons, interneurons, and microglial cells were described. IHC profiles of retinal layers and optic nerve are useful markers which can be applied in serological diagnostics of various ocular disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{introduce}} a new concept of anterior chamber angle microsurgery, designed to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork from the scleral sulcus as a potential treatment in primary open angle glaucoma.  METHODS—Gonioscopically controlled ab interno abrasion of the trabecular meshwork was performed on six human eye banking eyes for morphological analysis. Thereafter, four <b>eyes</b> suffering from <b>terminal</b> glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy {{as a result of}} medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure were also treated by `goniocurettage'. The newly designed instrument resembles a modified cyclodialysis spatula with a bowl-shaped tip, 300  µm in diameter, and with its edges sharpened. The treatment zone comprised 4 - 5 clock hours of the chamber angle circumference.  RESULTS—Microscopic examination of the treatment zone revealed that in addition to a complete disruption of the trabecular meshwork and internal wall of Schlemm's canal goniocurettage also caused damage to intracanalicular septa. A splitting along the posterior wall of Schlemm's canal was also noted in one specimen. The clinical data of goniocurettage also showed some promising results. Mean pretreatment IOP averaged 40. 7  (SD 8. 8) mm Hg (range 32 - 51 mm Hg) and was significantly (p< 0. 04) reduced to 18. 0  (4. 2) mm Hg (12 - 22 mm Hg) after 6  months, representing an absolute decrease in IOP of 22. 7  mm Hg and a mean decrease in IOP of 56 %. Clinically significant hyphaema occurred in one eye, caused by iatrogenic trauma to a prominent chamber angle vessel. In three eyes a minor reflux of blood occurred at the treatment site. However, no hypotony, choroidal effusion, flattened anterior chamber, or cyclodialysis were observed in these patients.  CONCLUSION—Morphological analysis of treated postmortem eyes confirmed that goniocurettage completely removed the trabecular meshwork and opened Schlemm's canal, ensuring direct access into the anterior chamber. In a small number of patients over a limited period of time this new surgical procedure resulted in a clinically significant pressure reduction. However, longer term follow up and a greater number of patients are warranted before this experimental procedure is applicable to eyes that would do well with conventional surgery. ...|$|R
