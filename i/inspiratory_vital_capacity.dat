40|$|Background: The normal inspiratory to expiratory {{ratio is}} 1 : 2. However, the {{duration}} of inspiration can be increased voluntarily till the ratio becomes 2 : 1. This is called as inverse ratio breathing. The effects of inverse ratio ventilation have been studied on patients with respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. No studies {{have been carried out}} to study the effects of inverse ratio breathing in voluntarily breathing individuals. Hence this study was carried out to find the immediate effects of inverse ratio breathing versus diaphragmatic breathing on <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion. Methods: 30 healthy adult females in the age group 20 - 25 years were included in the study. <b>Inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion at 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostal space was measured using a digital spirometer and an inelastic inch tape respectively. Diaphragmatic breathing was administered for one minute and the same parameters were measured again. A washout period of one day was given and same outcome measures were measured before and after individuals performed inverse ratio breathing {{with the help of a}} visual feedback video for one minute. Results: Data was analysed using Wilcoxon test. There was extremely significant difference between the mean increase in the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion at the 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostals space after inverse ratio breathing as compared to diaphragmatic breathing (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} {{was to assess the}} association of osteoporosis-related vertebral fracture burden and pulmonary function. This study also examined the relationship between vertebral fracture burden and height loss, estimated by arm span − height. This was a single-site and single-visit study. Patients had a history of at least 1 moderate or severe vertebral fracture. Vertebral fracture burden was quantified using the spinal deformity index (SDI). Pulmonary function during inspiration was determined by spirometry. Forty-one women aged 70 – 91 completed the study. Vertebral fracture burden negatively correlated with forced <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and inspiratory time.

40|$|Slow <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC) {{and forced}} expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) before and after an inhaled {{beta-agonist}} are widely used to detect reversible airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The measurement of airways resistance (Raw) during quiet breathing with the body plethysmograph is less frequently used. It may well be of importance in clinical emphysema where measurement of FEV, is confounded {{by the collapse of}} the bronchi, which does not occur when measuring Raw during quiet breathing. We assessed whether Rrs, in addition to IVC and FEV 1, can be used to gain a better insight into the reversibility with 400 mug of fenoterol in patients with clinical emphysema. We studied a group of 51 patients (9 women and 42 men; mean [+/- SD] age, 64. 7 [7. 7] years) who had a clinical diagnosis of emphysema. Significant reversibility was identified by spirometry (IVC, FEV 1) and body plethysmography (Raw) in 20 patients (39 percent). <b>Inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> alone identified reversibility of airflow limitation in 11 patients (22 percent).

The effect of sustained microgravity on lung volumes has not previously been investigated. Pulmonary function tests were performed by four subjects before, during, and after 9 days of microgravity exposure. Ground measurements were made in standing and supine postures. Tests were performed using a bag-in-box and flowmeter system and a respiratory mass spectrometer. Measurements of tidal volume (V(sub T)), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory <b>vital</b> <b>capacities</b> (IVC, EVC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) were made. During microgravity, V(sub T) decreased by 15 %.

40|$|Purpose: No {{randomized}} {{studies are}} available on the additional value of endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB) to external irradiation (XRT) regarding palliation of respiratory symptoms (RS). A prospective randomized study was initiated to test the hypothesis that the addition of EBB to XRT provides higher levels of palliation of dyspnea and other RS and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with endobronchial tumour. Materials and methods: Patients with previously untreated NSCLC, stages I-IIIb, WHO-performance status of 0 - 3 and with biopsy proven endobronchial tumour in the proximal airways were eligible. EBB consisted of two fractions of 7. 5 Gy at 1 cm on day 1 and 8. XRT started at day 2. The XRT dose was 30 Gy (2 weeks) or 60 Gy (6 weeks). The EORTC QLQ-C 30 and QLQ-LC 13 were assessed before treatment and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Re-expansion of collapsed lung was tested by the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC) and CT scan of the chest. Results: Ninety-five patients were randomized between arm 1 (XRT alone) (n = 48) or arm 2 (XRT + EBB) (n = 47). The arms were well balanced regarding pre-treatment characteristics and QoL scores. The compliance for QoL-assessment was > 90 % at all times. No significant difference between the trial arms was observed with respect to response of dyspnea. However, a beneficial effect of EBB was noted concerning the mean scores of dyspnea over time (P = 0. 02), which lasted for 3 months. This benefit was only observed among patients with an obstructing tumour of the main bronchus. A higher rate of re-expansion of collapsed lung was observed in arm 2 (57 %) compared to arm 1 (35 %) (P = 0. 01). The <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC) assessed 2 weeks after radiotherapy improved with 493 cm(3) in arm 2 and decreased 50 cm(3) in arm 1 (P = 0. 03). No difference was noted regarding the incidence of massive haemoptysis (13 vs. 15 %). Conclusion: The addition of EBB to XRT in NSCLC is safe and provides higher rates of re-expansion of collapsed lung resulting in a transient lower levels of dyspnea. This beneficial effect was only observed among patients with obstructing tumours in the main bronchus. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

A very good linear relationship was found between Vdi,RIP and Vdi,F during inspiration as well as expiration (r greater than 0. 95), indicating that the analysis of Mead and Loring was valid in the conditions of the present study. The diaphragmatic volume displacement (active or passive) accounted for 50 - 60 % of VC. A very good linear relationship was also found between mean axial motion and volume displacement of the diaphragm measured with both methods during inspiration and expiration (r greater than 0. 98).

Methods: This study was conducted from April 2008 to July 2009 in the Adult Intensive Care Unit, Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. Fifteen patients were included who were mechanically ventilated {{for more than seven}} days and had the following characteristics: tracheotomized; receiving intermittent nebulization; maximal inspiratory pressure of less than - 25 cm H 2 O; Tobin score less than 105; preserved respiratory drive; not sedated; partial arterial oxygen pressure greater than 70 mm Hg; oxygen saturation greater than 90 %; and hemodynamically stable. With inclinations of 0 ̈, 30 ̈ and 50 ̈, the following parameters were recorded: consciousness level; blinking reflex; thoracoabdominal cirtometry; vital capacity; tidal volume; minute volume; respiratory muscle strength; and vital signs. Results: No neurological level changes were observed. Respiratory rate and minute volume (VE) decreased at 30 % and later increased at 50 %; however, these changes were not statistically significant. Abdominal cirtometry and maximal expiratory pressure increased, but again, the changes were not statistically significant.

We evaluated whether the bronchodilatory effect of deep inspiration (DI) is affected by aging. We tested 25 healthy subjects (median age: 54 yrs, range: 25 – 83 yrs). Single dose methacholine (Mch) provocations were performed in the absence of DI, which induced at least 15 % reduction in <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC) from baseline. The post-Mch IVC measurement was followed by 4 DIs and by another IVC (post-DI IVC). The fractional difference between post-DI IVC and post-Mch IVC represented the % bronchodilation by DI. The % bronchodilation significantly diminished with aging (r= 0. 65, P= 0. 0005). The bronchodilatory ability of DI was also positively associated with the degree of Mch-induced reduction in IVC (r= 0. 84, P< 0. 0001). In multiple regression analysis, where % bronchodilation was the dependent variable, both % reduction in IVC (P< 0. 0001) and age (P= 0. 02) entered the model.

40|$|ABSTRACT Asthma exemplifies a {{major medical}} concern {{and is a}} {{considerable}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in Western society. Controversy still exists regarding the most effective mode and intensity of exercise training for asthmatics. Thus, {{the purpose of the study}} was to determine whether walking or jogging at 60 % of age-predicted heart rate maximum can increase effort-dependent pulmonary function parameters in moderate, persistent asthmatics. Forty-four sedentary asthmatics were randomly assigned to either a non-exercising control (NE) group (n = 22) or an eight-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (AE) group (n = 22). Results indicated that the subjects in the AE training group significantly (p = 0. 05) increased their forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC). The NE group did not exhibit any significant changes in any of the measured variables. Therefore, walking or jogging at 60 % heart rate maximum for 30 minutes three times a week for eight weeks can effectively improve the effort-dependent pulmonary parameters in moderate, persistent asthmatics. This represents a strong argument to support the inclusion of this mode of aerobic training in the treatment of moderate, persistent asthma due to its effectiveness, inexpensiveness and lowrisk...|$|E
40|$|Deep inspiration-induced bronchoprotection and {{bronchodilation}} are impaired in asthma. We {{evaluated the}} effect of inhaled glucocorticosteroids on these phenomena. Two groups of subjects with asthma, 9 with moderate/severe hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and 12 with mild/borderline hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, received inhaled fluticasone (880 microg daily) for 12 weeks. Serial bronchoprovocations were performed at Weeks 0, 6, and 12. The impact of deep inspirations on the airway response to methacholine was evaluated {{on the basis of}} <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and FEV(1). Fluticasone produced a wide spectrum of changes in the beneficial effects of deep inspiration, but the mean changes were not significant. The magnitude of the steroid-induced changes in bronchoprotection by deep inspiration correlated with baseline log PC(20) (the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20 % fall in FEV(1); higher log PC(20) predicted improvement of the deep inspiration effect). The steroid-induced changes led to the emergence of strong positive correlations between the effects of deep inspiration and the methacholine log PC(20) that did not exist at baseline. We conclude that deep inspiration-induced bronchoprotection can be restored by inhaled glucocorticosteroids only in individuals with mild hyperresponsiveness. After steroid treatment, the beneficial effects of deep inspiration become significant determinants of the magnitude of airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Several {{studies have}} shown that both {{objective}} and subjective measurements are related to exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study the relative contribution of lung function, maximal inspiratory pressure, dyspnoea, and quality of life to the performance in a walking distance test and a bicycle ergometer test was investigated. METHODS [...] Static lung volumes, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), <b>inspiratory</b> slow <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC), transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) divided by the alveolar volume (TLCO/VA), static compliance (Cst), and maximal inspiratory peak pressure (PImaxPOES) were measured in 40 patients with COPD with severe airways obstruction (mean FEV 1 44 % predicted, mean FEV 1 /IVC 37 % predicted). Quality of life was assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and dyspnoea by the Borg category scale. Exercise capacity was measured by both a six minute walking distance (test) and a maximal work load of the bicycle ergometer test (Wmax). RESULTS [...] Spirometric values and maximal inspiratory pressure were modestly correlated with both the six minute walking test and Wmax, r values ranging from 0. 50 to 0. 58. The TLCO was strongly correlated with the six minute walking test (r = 0. 62) and with Wmax (r = 0. 78). Quality of life showed no correlation with exercise capacity, while there was a correlation between dyspnoea and the six minute walking test (r = - 0. 41). Backward linear regression analysis selected TLCO and PImaxPOES as the most significant determinants for exercise performance. They explained 54 % and 69 % {{of the variance in the}} six minute walking test and Wmax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results show that exercise capacity in patients with COPD with severe airways obstruction is more strongly related to inspiratory muscle strength and lung function than to dyspnoea and quality of life. The significant correlation between dyspnoea and the six minute walking test suggests that subjective variables are more strongly related to walking tests than to bicycle ergometer tests...|$|R

SourceInstitute of Medicine and Pneumology, Respiratory Unit; University of Palermo, Italy. n. scichilone@libero. it Abstract PURPOSE: The {{effects of}} endurance training on airway responsiveness in nonasthmatic subjects are poorly defined. We hypothesized that airway responsiveness may differ between none-lite endurance athletes and sedentary subjects, and studied healthy, nonelite runners and sedentary controls by single-dose methacholine challenges {{carried out in}} the absence of deep inspirations, in that deep inspirations are known to oppose airway narrowing in nonasthmatic subjects. METHODS: A total of 20 nonasthmatic none-lite runners (mean age+/- SD: 43. 0 +/- 8. 5 yr; training volume: 68 km. wk; range: 40 - 100; racing experience: 11 +/- 8 yr) and 20 sedentary controls (age: 44. 0 +/- 20. 6 yr) were studied, all of them being normo-reactive to standard methacholine challenge up to 25 mg. mL concentration. All subjects were studied at rest; six runners were also studied about 1 h after completing the Palermo marathon (December 8, 2001). The primary outcome of the study was the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (IVC) obtained after single-dose methacholine inhalation at the end of 20 min of deep inspiration prohibition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), pursed-lips breathing (PLB) improves the pulmonary gas exchange and hyperinflation measured by electro-optic coupling. The response to PLB in inspiratory lung function tests is not known. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the effect of PLB on inspiratory parameters. METHODS: Thirty-five subjects with stable COPD and a forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV(1)) < 50 % of the predicted value were tested for the following primary parameters before and immediately after PLB, and 5 min later: forced <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity,</b> inspiratory capacity (IC), forced inspiratory volume in first second, maximal inspiratory flow at 50 % of vital capacity, and peak inspiratory flow. Patients were also tested for the following secondary parameters: vital capacity, FEV(1), breathing frequency, end-tidal CO(2) tension, and oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Of all the primary parameters only IC (p = 0. 006) improved significantly; with regard to the secondary parameters, the mean oxygen saturation was improved by 1 % (p = 0. 005) and the mean end-tidal CO(2) tension and breathing frequency decreased significantly (p < 0. 0001 for both) to 3. 2 mm Hg and 3. 1 breaths/min, respectively. After 5 min the effects diminished. CONCLUSION: Improved IC after PLB indicates less hyperinflation in {{patients with}} severe COPD; there was no effect on parameters of flow...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between several lung function indices and perceived dyspnoea during bronchoconstriction. Acute changes in lung function were induced by inhaled histamine followed by terbutaline, in 12 asthmatics and 12 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS), allowing subjects to report either improvement or worsening when moving off from a ‘nochange’ midpoint, was used to rate shortness of breath. Large swings in ratings were seen in all asthmatics and in seven out of 12 COPD subjects (high perceivers). Using linear regression of VAS rating against parallel change in lung function, on a within-subject basis, the highest degree of correlation between dyspnoea and objective response was found to involve the change in specific inspiratory resistance (sRin) in the asthmatics. In the five low perceivers, the ability to discriminate an increase in airway obstruction, estimated as the VAS/change in lung function slope, was very poor. Using a stepwise multiple regression analysis, the sensation of dyspnoea was found to be significantly related to the FEV 1 and the sRin in the asthmatics, to the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and the maximal inspiratory flow at 50 % FVC (MIF 50) in the COPD subjects with high perception, and to the MIF 50 in the COPD subjects with low perception...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vital</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{affected}} by age and body size. Most of the regression equations of predicted <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> are based on age and body height. In the same age group, <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> correlates remarkably with body height. But the <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> divided by height correlates remarkably with body size. Body height, body surface area, and the product of chest circumference and sitting height are used as a body size index.

40|$|We applied {{predicted}} <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> to chest size matching between {{donor and recipient}} in lung transplantation to 15 single-lung transplant recipients with {{pulmonary fibrosis}} and to 20 double-lung transplant recipients with emphysema or non-emphysema. The predicted <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> of the donor was significantly correlated with the predicted <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> of the recipient both in double-lung transplantation (r = 0. 79, p = 0. 001) and single-lung transplantation (r = 0. 71, p = 0. 003). In double-lung transplantation, the post-transplant <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> was correlated with the predicted <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> of the recipient (r = 0. 74, p = 0. 002). Emphysema patients and non-emphysema patients contributed equally to this correlation. In left single lung transplantation, there was a weak correlation between the post-transplant <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> and the predicted <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> of the donor in the allograft (r = 0. 57, p = 0. 1095).

In double-lung transplantation, the post-transplant <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> was limited by the recipient's normal thoracic volume and was not influenced by underlying pulmonary disease.
