40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} are {{key element}} of modern technology and have {{played an important role}} in agricultural productivity growth in India. However, the demand-supply gap <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports. Indian imports, which were about 2 million tonnes in early part of 2000, increased to 10. 2 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in 2008 - 09. In view <b>of</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in agricultural growth and the possibility of an emerging demand-supply gap, there is need to forecast future demand. The paper begins with an overview <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> consumption trends and then identifies important determinants <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> demand and develops projects demand scenarios for fertilisers in India in 2020 - 21. India is the second largest consumer <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use in India remains much lower than most countries in the world but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. The results show that non-price factors such as irrigation, high yielding varieties, were more important than price factors in influencing demand for <b>fertilisers.</b> <b>Of</b> the two price policy instruments, affordable fertiliser prices and higher agricultural commodity prices, the former is more powerful in influencing fertiliser demand. The paper suggests that in order to ensure self-sufficiency in agricultural production in the country, availability <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> at affordable prices should be prioritized over higher output prices. By 2020, fertiliser demand in the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing <b>fertiliser</b> requirements <b>of</b> the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role. ...|$|R
40|$|Spray {{adjuvants}} can {{be employed}} in the foliar application <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to ensure adhesion of aqueous sprays to the waxy surfaces of foliage (wetters), to improve coverage of spray on foliage (spreaders), to minimise weathering <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> deposits on foliage (stickers/extenders), and to increase the uptake <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> into foliage (humectants, pH modifiers, and penetrants). Even with improved formulations using effective adjuvants, foliar fertilisers must be regarded as supplements to overcome deficiencies in micronutrients, and to boost macronutrients at critical physiological stages, rather than as substitutes for soil-applied fertilisers...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to bring {{together}} all the information collected {{in the course of}} this research project and to present a synoptic view <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use in Southland as a guide to the future. The analysis is concerned with all forms <b>of</b> mineral <b>fertiliser</b> used in New Zealand pastoral farming and concentrates on the most important chemical fertiliser used - superphosphate. After reviewing the pattern of agricultural production in the province of Southland, the report considers livestock number trends, new developments in farming likely to affect livestock number trends, the use <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in pastoral farming, the production <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in Southland and fluctuations in the demand for fertiliser by farmers...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model of}} soil phosphorus carryover in grazed pasture provides {{the basis for}} bioeconomic optimization <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> rates. A linear constraint is introduced to optimise the allocation of limited funds to fertiliser on several farm blocks, each of which represents a different land and/or stock class. The optimal constrained maintenance application <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> to each block is calculated, and an heuristic approach to this equilibrium is suggested. In some cases this involves withholding <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> from unresponsive blocks. The dynamical model and economic optimisation method have been implemented in a commercial fertiliser planning decision support tool Outlook. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} agronomic strategies on the nutritional quality of head lettuce was investigated. The factors included were irrigation type, fertiliser input type and level. The assessed ingredient parameters were nitrate, lutein, ß-carotene and polyphenols. Hygiene {{was described by}} total aerobic bacterial count and number of coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Lettuce treated with mineral nitrogen fertiliser (calcium ammonium nitrate) displayed a higher nitrate content than lettuce treated with organic manures (fresh farmyard manure (FYM), rotten FYM (fermented nettle extract). Nitrate concentration in lettuce tended to increase with increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> independent <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> type. Fertiliser type and level also affected the carotenoid content. Rapidly available nitrogen from mineral fertiliser gave higher lutein levels compared with slowly released nitrogen. Similar results were observed for ß-carotene. There were no obvious differences regarding polyphenols for the different modes <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> input. The bacteriological quality was only marginally {{or not at all}} influenced by the type <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser...</b>|$|R
