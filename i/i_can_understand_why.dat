It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why.</b> He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E

Avatar Forums posted a topic thread entitled [...] "Ways to cope with the depression of the dream of Pandora being intangible" [...] which received [...] "1,000 posts from people experiencing depression and fans trying to help them cope" [...] (a second thread was posted for more room). Philippe Baghdassarian, the site administrator, commented that, [...] "I wasn't depressed myself. In fact the movie made me happy, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> it made people depressed. The movie was so beautiful and it showed something we don't have here on Earth. I think people saw we could be living in a completely different world and that caused them to be depressed." [...] Many have confessed to falling to depression and harbouring suicidal thoughts, while others have expressed disgust towards humanity and [...] "disengagement with reality." [...] Psychiatrist Dr. Stephan Quentzel added that [...] "Virtual life is not real life and it never will be, but this is the pinnacle of what we can build in a virtual presentation so far." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. For a second, I was tempted to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls. Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation. It was based on his desire to help a young woman he'd met once who was an icon in our shared sport." ...|$|E

I urged that we had given our word to Doctor Warren; {{that we would be}} shamed, and he have reason to set us down as cowards, if we failed to do as had been promised, winding up my entreaties with the assertion that if father was at home he would insist most strongly upon my doing whatsoever little I might in behalf of that effort to teach the king a lesson which seemed so near at hand.|$|E
