5000|$|The {{island was}} {{the focal point}} of Project Rose (Action Rose) by the GDR {{government}} designed to nationalize hotels, taxis and service companies on 10 February 1953.

Many of the hotel owners were convicted by kangaroo courts under the pretext of having been engaged in economic crime or as agents working for the West. Their property was then confiscated and they were sent to prison. Many of the owners and small businessmen were incarcerated in Bützow prison. The hotels were supposed to have been expropriated by the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB). In fact, they were used as accommodation for the barracks-based [...] "people's police" [...] (Kasernierte Volkspolizei or CPI). As a result of the confiscation of <b>hotels,</b> <b>tourism</b> on Rügen in 1953 came almost to a complete standstill for a time.|$|E

40|$|In hotel organisations, {{managers}} use {{the yearly}} employee appraisals to give feedback {{and discuss the}} goals for future years with their employees. But, is this actually enough? Personnel development should occur on a continuous basis, and the employee appraisals can thus be connected to an overall coaching plan. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the relevance of coaching for front line receptionists in the hotel industry, by collecting empirical data from managers and employees at Scandic Rubinen. Theoretical results indicate that employee empowerment, employee motivation, and leadership are important for employees as well as a clear coaching leadership strategy in the hotel organisations. The empirical results signify that the perception of coaching differs between managers and employees, but both parts lift up the importance of supporting and motivating the employees. It is essential for the management to understand that front line receptionists are the image of the hotel, and thus {{one of the most important}} resources. Therefore, my recommendation is that coaching leadership strategies should be implemented for front line receptionists at the <b>hotels.</b> <b>Tourism</b> and Hospitality Managemen...|$|E

Engaged employees are generally more satisfied with their work, committed and effective at work. According to the JDR model (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004), engagement may be produced by two types of working conditions: job demands (i. e., role stress) and job resources (i. e., psychological empowerment; self-efficacy). This study examines the role of psychological empowerment and work engagement as antecedents of job satisfaction. A cross sectional study using online questionnaires was conducted. The sample consisted of 152 Portuguese workers in <b>hotels.</b> <b>Tourism</b> is an important tool for profit and the Portuguese hotels are fundamental for the growth of the country. Employee satisfaction increases employee retention and increases productivity influencing the income / profits for hotels. Hierarchical multiple regressions analyses revealed that job satisfaction was significantly predicted by psychological empowerment and work engagement. Results support JDR model by showing that positive outcomes, such as job satisfaction, may be predicted by motivational process and job demands. On a practical level, JDR model provides a framework for understanding motivating workplaces and engaged and satisfied hotel employees...|$|E

How are the politicians responding? In a recent interview with Julian Pettifer of BBC Television John Compton, Prime Minister of St. Lucia, complained that the playing field was not level. 'We in the four tiny Windward Islands have about 20, 000 farmers producing less than 400, 000 tonnes of bananas: and you put them against the multi-nationals in Central and other parts of Latin America with vast populations dealing with thousands and thousands of acres and producing something like 2 million tonnes of bananas. '' efficiency, he said, had to be related to resources. 'We have small farmers, with small plots of land on mountainous territory, yet they are producing better quality, finer tasting fruit. ' Asked whether aid should be offered rather than making spacial arrangements for Caribbean producers in the European market, John Compton replied 'I think that really is beneath our dignity. What we ask for is to earn our living. We don't want to be given food stamps rather than a job. We have a job here and we want to maintain that job and to earn our living, that is what we ask for. ' Dame Eugenia Charles, Prime Minister of Dominica, was asked by Spore for her views. She saw the issue as one shared between the Caribbean producers and the European Community. 'None of the European countries could afford to support us if we become an economic disaster area, because they have their own financial difficulties. Banana production is not just an interest of ours, it is our life-blood. The industry cannot be allowed to go to the wail. ' Could the tourist industry replace banana cultivation as a major source of income? Not according to John Conpton. 'I cannot see the farmers in the hills going to serve daiquiri in the <b>hotels.</b> <b>Tourism</b> has its place and tourism will grow, but it will not take the place of agricutuure. Even if we go into diversification and diversify into any other thing, we have to diversify around bananas, not away from bananas.
