50|$|Fresh fruit {{are usually}} unpalatable, {{but they can}} be <b>debittered</b> and made into compote, jelly, jam, a tangy syrup, a tart chutney, or juice, as well as wine and liqueur, or used for tea or to make flour. Fruit are served as a side dish to lamb or game. Debittering can be {{accomplished}} by freezing, cooking, or drying, which degrades the parasorbic acid. The fruit are red colored in August but usually only harvested in October after the first frost by cutting the corymbs. The robust qualities of S. aucuparia make it a source for fruit in harsh mountain climate and Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Monarchy recommended the planting of the species in 1779.An edible variety, named Sorbus aucuparia var. dulcis Kraetzl, or var. edulis Dieck, or var. moravica Dippel, was first discovered in 1810 near Ostružná in the Hrubý Jeseník mountain range of Northern Moravia and became widespread in Germany and Austria the early 20th century. Its leaves are larger and pointed, only the front part of the leaflets is serrated, and they have darker bark, larger buds and larger fruit. Similar non-bitter varieties found in Southern Russia were first introduced in Central Europe in 1900 as 'Rossica' and 'Rossica Major', which has large fruit up to 1.5 cm in diameter.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{contribution}} of proline residues to protein hydrolysate bitterness, much {{research has focused on}} the application of proline-specific exopeptidases in hydrolysate <b>debittering</b> strategies due to the general inability of most general aminopeptidases to hydrolyze the imino bond ([FitzGerald and O'Cuinn 2006]). PepP from lactococcoal strains may contribute to the abolition of bitterness during cheese ripening when peptide degradation is involved during fermentation ([McDonnell et al. 1997]). <b>Debittering</b> of a tryptic hydrolysate of β-casein has been described using purified general and proline-specific aminopeptidases from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris AM 2 ([Bouchier et al. 2001]). Thus, PepP has industrial potential based on its application to the enzymatic <b>debittering</b> of proline-rich peptide mixtures in foods. In addition to native enzyme production and purification, recombinant DNA technology can be used to express large amounts of interesting enzymes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]). This possibility greatly expands the range of potential applications for enzymes (e.g., β-galactosidases) and their economically effective utilization in industrial processes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]).|$|R

40|$|Naturally <b>debittered</b> Hurma olive {{is grown}} in a {{specific}} area in Karaburun peninsula in Turkey. It is characterised by its sweet taste and it differs from other varieties by losing its bitterness caused by phenolic compounds during its maturation period on the tree. Therefore, Hurma olive does not require any further debittering process to be served as table olive. This study was {{particularly interested in the}} comparison of the microbial profile of Hurma olive during its 8 weeks of maturation period in two subsequent harvest years and Erkence (not naturally <b>debittered)</b> olive. In addition, main bacterial profile of both Hurma and Erkence olives were isolated and identified.

She complained of blurry vision, headache, photophobia and nausea. No specific treatment was needed, and the symptoms resolved about 12 h after the exposure. Lupine beans are a popular and worldwide-diffused food. The bitter variety is rich in alkaloids harbouring anticholinergic activity and thus requires a debittering process before lupines can be eaten. Only four cases of acute toxicity, due to the ingestion of incompletely detoxified bitter lupines, have been reported in children so far; notwithstanding the small amount of lupines ingested, three of these cases were lethal.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hurma, {{an olive}} variety that {{grows in a}} {{specific}} area in Turkey, loses its bitterness before harvesting, and therefore does not need further processing steps {{for the production of}} table olives. The total phenol content and phenolic profiles of (1) this naturally <b>debittered</b> olive type, Hurma; (2) the same olive variety, but not a naturally <b>debittered</b> type, Erkence; and (3) another variety, Gemlik, which is commonly consumed as table olive, were determined during their maturation period for two harvest years. RESULTS: The total phenol content of Hurma is the lowest compared to the other types regardless of harvest year, which has a significant effect on the phenolic content and composition of individual components for all olive types. All three olive types can be differentiated from each other especially during the late phase of maturation using the phenolics profile in combination with principal component analysis. CONCLUSION: The natural debittering phenomenon of Hurma olive on the tree involves a decrease in phenol content and a change in phenol composition. The differentiation in phenol composition especially becomes very significant in the late of period of maturation. Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TOVAG- 110 O 780...|$|E

40|$|Olives can <b>debitter</b> {{naturally}} {{without the}} use of NaOH but it is a very slow process. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the influence of both temperature and chemical characteristics of brine on the oleuropein hydrolysis rate in natural table olives. Two different phases were established for natural <b>debittering.</b> During the first 1 – 2 months of brining, a low concentration of NaCl (60  g/L) and acetic acid (2  g/L) together with a low storage temperature (10  °C) were the processing conditions that promoted a rapid hydrolysis of the bitter phenol because these mild conditions facilitated the action of endogenous enzymes (β-glucosidase and esterase). Thereafter, higher concentrations and temperature of storage (140  g/L NaCl, 16  g/L acetic acid and 40  °C) favored the chemical hydrolysis of oleuropein during long term (a few months) storage. These results will contribute to the knowledge of the natural <b>debittering</b> of table olives and they will help processors to accelerate their elaboration methods.

The extruded products were evaluated for their physical (moisture retention, expansion, hardness, water solubility index (WSI) and water absorption index (WAI)), sensory (flavor, texture, color and overall acceptability) characteristics and in vitro GI to evaluate their suitability as extruded snack products. Due to the distinct bitter taste, inclusion of fenugreek flour was not acceptable at levels more than 2 % in extruded chickpea based products.

The microbial starter was composed by Lb. pentosus strains. The automatized process was compared with natural fermentation in plastic vats, as control. Relevant process parameters, chemico-physical determinations, instrumental texture, and microbiological analyses were carried out to monitor the fermentation process. Driving the process in controlled conditions resulted in a more rapid acidification, pH reaching lower values than the control. In controlled conditions, inoculated lactobacilli carried out a fast colonization supplanting more rapidly spoilage microflora.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of bitterness in citrus juices would increase their acceptance by the consumer.

The use of a cheap, simple and effective immobilisation method combined with high pressure can be a key asset in the <b>debittering</b> of citrus juices. The aim of this study is the <b>debittering</b> of grapefruit juice under high pressure, with naringinase immobilized in calcium alginate beads. Naringinase, an alpha-rhamnopyranosidase, hydrolyzes naringin (a flavanone glycoside and primary bitter component in grapefruit juice) to naringenin, which is tasteless. High pressure can activate or inhibit enzymatic activities depending on the proteins and conditions. The hydrolysis of naringin was first evaluated in model solution (acetate buffer 0. 02 M, pH= 4. 0) and then in grapefruit juice. In model solution, at 160 MPa and 37 degrees C, a 50 % increase in the concentration of reducing sugars was obtained when compared to the reaction at atmospheric pressure. The higher naringenin concentration (33 mg/L) was obtained at 54 degrees C under high pressure of 200 MPa, which corresponds to a naringin {{reduction of}} 72 % in model solution, while at atmospheric pressure (0. 1 MPa), the naringin reduction was only 35 %. The decrease in naringin content can be directly correlated with the reduction in bitterness. From the concentration of residual naringin, the percentage of reduction in bitterness was evaluated.

40|$|Table olives {{have been}} a {{component}} of the Mediterranean diet for centuries and their consumption is increasing worldwide because of their nutritional and palatable characteristics. The raw olive drupe is inedible because of its high content in a bitter glucoside named oleuropein, which is hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions during the two most popular methods of preparing table olives, the Spanish-style green olives and the California-style black olives. Moreover, natural olives are those that do not suffer the alkaline treatment but lose their bitterness slowly for months due to the acid hydrolysis of the oleuropein (1). Recently, a new and rapid method to <b>debitter</b> olives has been proposed, which is based on the oxidation of the oleuropein (2). However, this method has failed in some cases and a study has been carried out to optimize this new process. Olives preserved in acidified brine into industrial tanks were maintained under oxygen overpressure for several days and the phenolic content was analyzed. The reduction in olives of the oleuropein concentration ranged from 30 to 100 %, being lower as the storage time in tanks progressed. As it has been previously reported (2), the enzyme polyphenoloxidase catalyzes the oxidation reaction of oleuropein giving rise to non-bitter products. Likewise, the activity of this enzyme is highly reduced in preserved olives (3). Hence, it was hypothesized that the <b>debittering</b> must be carried out soon after brining of olives. New oxidation experiments were performed with olives stored just only one month in the acidified brines and the reduction of oleuropein concentration in fruit reached 90 - 95 %.

Two unidentified isolates, IST 20 B and IST 40 D exhibited the highest specific growth rates (0. 13 and 0. 17 h"-" 1 respectively) and were able to remove 99 % of the initial lupanine after ca. 24 h incubation at 27 deg C in a media containing only lupanine (2 gl"-" 1) and mineral salts. Both of these might be useful for the biotechnological treatment of alkaloid-containing effluents with high alkaloid content which may conceivably originate from a lupine seed fractionation process. Final alkaloid contents were found to be lowered to 42 and 53 % of initial values after a 44 h growth at 20, 27 or 34 deg C in a medium prepared from an aqueous Lupinus albus extract. These isolates were also tested as to their ability to debitter feed grade Lupinus flour, and it was found that their efficiency of alkaloid removal depended on initial inoculum content, temperature and incubation time. The effects of these variables were modelled using the response surface methodology, yielding equations useful in predicting final alkaloid content in <b>debittered</b> floursAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|In {{recent years}} it has {{increased}} the interest in the role that certain foods have on some chronic diseases in particular against free radicals. Furthermore, certain foods show positive effects on one or more specific functions of the body, {{in addition to the}} normal nutritional role, so as to improve the health and well-being and/or reduce the risk of diseases. In the olives and its derivatives it has been recognized antioxidant capacity and beneficial properties against degenerative diseases induced by oxidative stress, due to the particular fatty acid composition, the important concentration of phenolic compounds and the Vitamin E content. The phenolic content of olives and their transformation products may be influenced by several factors: variety (type of cultivar), processing methods, soil conditions, climatic and technological processes. In table olives functional characteristics and antioxidants are strongly influenced by the fermentation process mediated by microbial starters. The type of inoculum may conditioning the final characteristics of the product. This work is divided in two part. In the first part it were evaluated the nutraceutical characteristics of some monocultivar extravirgin olive oils from Italy by means of their phenolic and Vitamin E composition, and antioxidant capacity. Furthermore the technological performances, during the processing of table olives, of two starters were evaluated: a Single Strain LAB (SSL) starter culture and a Selected Inoculum Enrichment (SIE), made up of an undefined number of strains, taking natural fermentation (NF) as control. Fermentation profile has been traced monitoring microbial counts, pH, titratable acidity and volatile acidity development. Phenolic profile, antioxidant capacity, along with instrumental texture analyses and sensory evaluations have been carried out to define the impact of the technologies employed on the quality features during the processing and in the final products. In the second part of this thesis it were evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some common foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Allium sativum L.; Allium cepa L.; Ocimum basilicum, L.; Petroselinum crispum) and shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) extracts. Actually this is an important topic of study within the renewed philosophy of “more natural life” and environmentally friendly. The Olive oils tested showed excellent quality characteristics. SIE resulted more efficient in supplanting the spoilage microbiota (Enterobacteriaceae) compared to SSL and NF. Both starters were able to lower the pH at security levels in a shorter time compared to NF driven fermentation that resulted in higher final pH levels and lower titratable acidity. Texture analyses showed that NF samples retained more cohesiveness and elasticity than inoculated samples. However, SIE samples texture resulted more firm and elastic, compared to SSL texture. Microbial starters efficiently <b>debittered</b> the olives in 5 months, while NF samples resulted not yet <b>debittered</b> {{at the end of the}} sampling period. The results obtained in the second part of the thesis shown an activity profile of the extract of garlic for most of the tested strains. The results obtained from the experiments on the biofilm showed the oppositive trend to expected, in contrast to the antimicrobial action of the extract. The foods we studied could produce increased activity in the commensal (greater biofilm physiological) reducing pathogenicity. The most important fact, concerning the extract of Lentinula edoses, is the increase of the biofilm of the probiotic compared to the pathogen (inhibited). This could allow the use of the shiitake mushroom in the treatment of periodontal disease...|$|E

Integral cells, total autolisate and yeast extract did not differ statistically (p <= 0. 05) regarding Protein Efficiency Ratio and Net Protein Ratio, which were significantly lower than the casein value. The growth promoting capacity was higher for casein, followed by integral cells, yeast extract and total autolisate, in decreasing order of magnitude. Net protein utilization values confirmed the Protein Efficiency Ratio and Net Protein Ratio results. Yeast products protein nutritive value was statistically identical but inferior to casein value. On the whole, the nutritive value of the yeast products protein ranked between 80 - 85 % of the casein value. Uric acid serum concentration increased in the rats fed the diets containing yeast products, but the values remained in the range considered of normality for rats. The diet containing yeast autolisate produced a reduction of the triacylglycerols content, which was not observed in the other diets. For total cholesterol and High Density Lipoproteins-cholesterol all three yeast diets were similar and did not differ from the casein diet...|$|E
5000|$|A major {{constraint}} to {{the wider}} adoption of B. senegalensis is the recalcitrant nature of its seeds. Seeds of this type are not well suited for ex-situ conservation, as they rapidly lose viability, and embryos are killed when seeds are dried. [...] This creates a barrier to widespread growth, as {{it is difficult to}} propagate large numbers of plants for large-scale genetic selection and breeding.

40|$|The {{flavonoid}} naringin is {{the main}} source of the undesirable bitter taste in some citrus juices. In commercial <b>debittering</b> processes, the naringin is adsorbed on non-ionic polymeric resins. Organo-clays (OCs), which have been used as sorbents for organic pollutants, could also have affinity for the naringin molecule, and thus potentially could serve as a <b>debittering</b> agent. The objective {{of the present study was}} to characterize the sorption capacity of a prepared OC to evaluate its ability to remove naringin from aqueous solutions, investigating the effect of adsorbent dose, initial concentration of naringin, temperature, contact time, and pH. The OC was prepared by the intercalation of cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in a Mexican bentonite. The host clay and the OC were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, and nitrogen gas adsorption. The OC showed a surface area of 9. 3 m 2 g− 1, 11. 35 nm average pore diameter, and a basal spacing, d 001, of 2. 01 nm. The adsorbent removed naringin at the rate of 60 – 72 % at 25 ºC and pH 3. The sorption capacity increased with pH and temperature. Experimental data were well fitted by both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. Most of the sorption took place during the first 10 min and the equilibrium time was reached within 720 min. The rate of sorption was adjusted to pseudo second-order kinetics...|$|R
