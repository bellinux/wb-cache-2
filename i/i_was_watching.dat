500|$|In late April 2011, Grace Potter {{from the}} American rock band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals sang a rootsy {{acoustic}} rendition of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] along with strategic handclaps and drummer Matthew Burr's backbeat. Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the video, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> for the visual candy. Then I slowly began {{falling in love with}} the song." [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard magazine complimented the cover, writing: [...] " [...] may usually rock with a 60s feel while Texas-born Beyoncé is a queen of R, but one thing the two women undoubtedly have in common is an amazing set of pipes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It {{was like}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the film, {{and putting it}} on pause, and giving a back story to the story. It {{immediately}} clicked with me. Like Scarface or {{any one of those}} films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film." ...|$|E
500|$|Hwang Min-woo, a 7-year-old boy who dances at the {{beginning}} of the video. During an interview with CNN, Psy stated that [...] "the night before the music video shoot, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> Korea's Got Talent and saw him dance to Michael Jackson. His moves were ridiculous. So we called him up and asked him to be in the music video, which was shooting the very next day, and he came and it all worked out." [...] He has been praised for his eye-catching dance moves that have received a lot of attention from viewers.|$|E

500|$|Grissom {{was born}} as {{an only child}} to a middle-class family in Santa Monica, California. Grissom's father taught botany at a local college and passed his enthusiasm for natural {{sciences}} onto his son. His father died when Grissom was 9 years old. Grissom recalls the day his father died to Catherine Willows in the episode [...] "Still Life", [...] "He came home from school, one hot humid day, laid down on the couch. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> TV, my mom brought in some cold drinks, but she couldn't wake him up. No one would tell me why." [...] Consequently, as a young child, Grissom played doctor by performing necropsies on small, deceased animals in the local area.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|Desi Arnaz, Jr. voiced {{his support}} of the film, stating {{that he and his}} sister Lucie Arnaz, [...] "loved the story being told in this movie." [...] Arnaz, Jr. said, [...] "It is an amazing saga of people in search of the American dream. It is my father`s story. It is the story of many people who came to this country with hopes and dreams." [...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've seen the movie twice, and I loved it the second time. The first time I couldn't get into it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> for too many details, I guess. But now I've seen it a second time, and I think it's great." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't {{a matter}} of {{impression}} at all," [...] she retorted. [...] "It <b>is</b> the truth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> followed from London, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watched</b> at Cannes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>watched</b> here day by day--by a little man in a brown suit and a Homburg hat, and with a habit of lounging. He lounges under my windows, he is probably lounging across the way now. He has lounged within fifty yards of me {{for the last three}} weeks, and {{to tell you the truth}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> tired of him. Couldn't I have a week's holiday? I'll keep a diary and tell you all that you want to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} all happy men, very ridiculous," [...] said Mrs. Tristram. [...] "It's the usual thing, neither better nor worse. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> {{you for the}} last ten minutes, and <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> M. de Bellegarde.

500|$|Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the band wrote the first line and the first little melody of the song years prior but did not finish it until 2007. Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, {{and it made me}} think that so many people spend their lives being told what to do by people that they just don't like. So it was that idea, and watching Bill O'Reilly, and all these words just came out." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was seen by}} 6.52 million viewers, ranking third in its time slot among major television networks. The episode received a 7 rating/10 share, which continued a downward trend in Homicide ratings since the January 31 post-Super Bowl series premiere, [...] "Gone for Goode". [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] lost ratings in large part due to a live Oprah Winfrey 90-minute interview with pop singer Michael Jackson, which aired on ABC and was seen by 36.59 million people, the fourth-highest total recorded by an entertainment program at the time since 1960. Yaphet Kotto said of the scheduling, [...] ""Heck, on that night, even <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> Oprah instead of our show." [...] Homicide also lost in its time slot to a cast reunion of The Andy Griffith Show, which aired on CBS and attracted 11.36 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its {{animation}}. Berardinelli called it {{some of the worst}} CGI animation in memory. He felt that the characters looked plastic, considered the backgrounds dull, and wrote, [...] "On more than one occasion, I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> something made for TV. When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve." [...] Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to [...] "Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde." [...] Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, [...] "the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done {{in the early days of}} CG... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, [...] "their faces are without nuance or vividness... In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But, Henry," [...] she protested, [...] "I {{tell you}} that {{there is no doubt about}} the matter. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>watched</b> day and night--I, an {{insignificant}} person whose doings can be of no possible interest save to you and you only." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} proof {{within the last}} few hours," [...] I said, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> under {{a certain amount of}} suspicion, and it is very {{possible}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>watched.</b> Yet, after all, that is comparatively unimportant. Do you think that Polloch would see me?" ...|$|R
500|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{cast as the}} title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco {{went from being a}} non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. [...] "It was a very lonely existence," [...] he notes. [...] "If I wasn't on a set, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean." [...] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man." [...] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).|$|E
500|$|Phill Udel of State said that, {{with the}} song, Girls Aloud [...] "have managed to {{maintain}} the quality" [...] they had prior {{to the release of}} Ten, and commented that [...] "the other three new songs are nowhere near up to the same standard." [...] Idolator blogger Sam Lansky commented that, for the fans, [...] "Something New" [...] is [...] "a welcome relief to [...] have an injection of fresh energy into the stagnant girl group scene," [...] and concluded that, [...] "given that this may be the group's final single before disbanding for good, they're certainly going out on a high note, with a track that feels quintessentially Aloud but retooled for 2012." [...] Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is [...] "on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song," [...] while noting that they have [...] "clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name." [...] Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics [...] "are the usual post-Spice fare," [...] but commented that [...] "the images weren't quite matching the words. I was hearing the battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> five young women wearing identical orange mini-dresses, strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity, like catwalk models." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{who were}} {{generally}} less positive in their opinions of Tangled {{and its main}} characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider were otherwise impressed by Pascal and Maximus' performances. The Liverpool Echos Catherine Jones felt that [...] "Pascal and Maximus shamelessly scene-steal from the human characters", while Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail wrote, [...] "The enjoyable visual gags generally come from the two animal sidekicks". The Illinois Times Chuck Koplinski wrote, [...] "Throw in two animal sidekicks – wily horse Maximus and protective chameleon Pascal – {{and you have a}} film that, while not as moving as the Pixar movies, is a satisfying lark." [...] TV Guide opined that although [...] "There's nothing particularly innovative about Dan Fogelman's screenplay", the author wrote that [...] "a cute animal sidekick ... extend to the visual aspects of the film". Similarly, Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This ride's a familiar one, but with humourous (sic) sidekicks such as horse-who-thinks-he's-a-dog Maximus and chameleon Pascal, it's thoroughly enjoyable." [...] Although Dave White of Movies.com strongly panned Tangled, he dubbed Pascal and Maximus the film's [...] "Most Memorable Cliché", writing that the characters [...] "are better than the movie deserves." [...] White continued, [...] "they both steal scene after scene from the Cream of Wheat-like main characters", concluding, [...] "I kept wishing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> a movie about just them." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn, who was ambivalent towards the film, admitted that Pascal and Maximus [...] "provide some chuckles." [...] Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out wrote, [...] "With two such bland heroes, it's good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters, notably ... a bad tempered but loveable horse", while Todd Hertz of Christianity Today called Maximus [...] "a more complex, multi-dimensional character than some movies' leads". Despite calling the film [...] "bland", the Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli called Maximus a [...] "stone cool" [...] character. Tyler Hanley Palo Alto Weekly, however, praised the entire ensemble as a whole, calling Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable quartet." [...] In a lone lukewarm review, James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Pascal [...] "among the least recognizable animal sidekicks (although he possesses amusing mannerisms)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warhol {{had this}} to say about the attack: [...] "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always {{suspected}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> television. The channels switch, but it's all television." ...|$|E

The highlight of his season was scoring 209 not out for an Eastern Province Invitational XI against the International Cavaliers, which included bowlers such as Richie Benaud and Graham McKenzie. Benaud was to describe the innings as [...] "magnificent", later saying [...] "I knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> a champion." [...] Aged 19, Pollock was the youngest South African to score a double-century in first-class cricket.|$|E

I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look {{on my face and}} she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror.

2500|$|Watt, Lee and Tamposi {{then asked}} Kygo {{to return to}} their studio to hear [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] for a second time. Tamposi recalled, [...] "When they pushed the space bar to play the song, [...] went from this very sweet, polite, charming young man to this super-human {{producer}} guy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> his eyes go back, left and right, just mapping out how he envisioned the production of the song. He was extremely excited". Lee and Tamposi then left for Kygo and Watt to work on the production where they followed the melodies and message of the demo.
