5000|$|If {{excision}} is {{precise and}} the original sequence of DNA is restored, reversible phase variation can be mediated by transposition. Phase variation mediated by transposition targets specific DNA sequences. [...] P. atlantica contains an eps locus that encodes extracellular polysaccharide and the ON or OFF expression of this locus {{is controlled by the}} presence or absence of IS492. Two recombinases encoded by MooV and Piv mediate the precise excision and insertion, respectively, of the <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> IS492 in the eps locus. When IS492 is excised it becomes a circular extrachromosomal element that results in the restored expression of eps. Another, more complex example of site specific DNA rearrangement is used in the flagella of Salmonella typhimurium. In the usual phase, a promotor sequence promotes the expression of the H2 flagella gene along with a repressor of H1 flagella gene. Once this promotor sequence is inverted by the hin gene the repressor is turned off as is H2 allowing H1 to be expressed.|$|E

40|$|IS 200 is an {{insertion}} sequence {{present in all}} Salmonella species except S. agona (1, 2). The element is absent from all other Enterobacteriaceae, {{with the exception of}} some strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei (2). It had been hypothesized that the first mutation characterized as an IS 200 insertion, hisD 984 ::IS 200 (1, 3) might actually be a deletion mutant of the Shigella <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> IS 630 (4). However, sequencing of the ends of a second mutation caused by IS 200 insertion later suggested that IS 200 was a distinct <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> (5).

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} an <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> IS 900 in Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is reported. This {{is the first}} characterised example of a mycobacterial <b>insertion</b> <b>element.</b> IS 900 consists of 1451 bp of which 66 % is G + C. It lacks terminal inverted and direct repeats, characteristic of Escherichia coli insertion elements but shows a degree of target sequence specificity. A single open reading frame (ORF 1197) coding for 399 amino acids is predicted. This amino acid sequence, {{and to a lesser}} extent the nucleotide sequence, show significant homologies to IS 110, an <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> of Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2). It is proposed that IS 900, IS 110, and similar insertion elements recently identified in disease isolates of Mycobacterium avium are members of a phylogenetically related family. IS 900 will provide highly specific markers for the precise identification of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, useful in defining its relationship to animal and human diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} Mu can insert its DNA at a {{large number}} of sites in the Escherichia coli chromosome and mediates a variety of chromosomal rearrangements (Taylor 1963; Bukhari and Zipser 1972; Danietl et al. 1972; Faelen and Toussaint 1978). Since Mu DNA has never been found in its free form but always appears to be associated with bacterial DNA, the integration of Mu resembles the transposition of <b>insertion</b> <b>elements</b> (for review, see Bukhari 1976). However, the only direct proof that the mechanisms of transposition of Mu and <b>insertion</b> <b>elements</b> are related stems from the observa-tion that upon integration of Mu, as upon transposition of <b>insertion</b> <b>elements,</b> a segment of host DNA is dupli-cated at the target site (for review, see Calos and Miller 1980). The main difference between Mu and <b>insertion</b> <b>elements</b> lies in the efficiency of the respective transposi-tion systems. Furthermore, transposition of Mu in lyric development seems to be the main cause for the rapid amplification of Mu DNA. The linkage between trans-position and replication is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} phage attachment sites are also required for replication, and the products of genes A and B, which are required for replication, are also involved in transposition (O'Day et al. 1978; van de Putte t al. 1978). However, the A-gene product is essential for integration, whereas the B-gene product has only a stimulatory effect (O'Day et al. 1978). Both precise and imprecise xcision of Mu require the A-gene product and the absence of the B-gene product (Bukhari 1975). Our studies have focused on the structural features of bacteriophage Mu integration, and we shall discuss pos-sible implications of these results with respect to the ex-istence of different pathways for transposition...|$|R

40|$|The soybean lectin gene Le 1 encodes a {{prevalent}} seed {{protein and}} is highly regulated {{during the life}} cycle. The mutant lectin gene allele le 1 is not transcribed detectably, contains a 3. 5 -kb Tgm 1 <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> within its coding region 0. 6 kb 3 ' to the transcription start site, and leads to a lectinless phenotype. To determine whether the Tgm 1 element or a secondary mutation was responsible for repressing le 1 gene transcription, we eliminated the <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> by constructing a chimeric lectin gene (le 1 /Le 1) that contained the 5 ' half of the le 1 gene and its promoter region and the 3 ' half of the wild-type Le 1 gene. Transformed tobacco seed containing the le 1 /Le 1 gene produced both lectin mRNA and protein, demonstrating that the mutant lectin gene control region is transcriptionally competent. By contrast, transformed seed containing the le 1 gene produced no detectable lectin mRNA. We conclude {{that the absence of}} detectable transcription from the le 1 gene is due to transcriptional inhibition by the Tgm 1 <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> and that this element acts at a distance to block transcription from an upstream promoter region...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{developing}} strategies to obtain a mutation in the aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) gene of Mycobacterium smegmatis, an efficient transposon trap was constructed which may be generally useful for the identification of transposable elements in mycobacteria. A DNA fragment containing the asd gene was replaced with an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene (aph) to generate a delta asd::aph allele. Attempts to replace the wild-type asd gene with the delta asd::aph allele were unsuccessful, suggesting that this deletion was lethal {{to the growth of}} M. smegmatis. The plasmid, pYUB 215, which contains beta-galactosidase expressed from a mycobacteriophage promoter and delta asd::aph, was integrated into the chromosome of M. smegmatis by a homologous, single-crossover, recombination event. Visual screening for inactivation of the beta-galactosidase gene in the resulting strain allowed the isolation of a novel mycobacterial <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> from M. smegmatis. This <b>insertion</b> <b>element,</b> which is unique to M. smegmatis, was designated IS 1096 and transposes at a frequency of 7. 2 x 10 (- 5) per cell in an apparently random fashion. IS 1096 is 2, 275 bp in length and contains two open reading frames which are predicted to encode proteins involved in transposition.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possible transmission of tuberculosis among 39 inmates with positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis smears in four correctional institutions located in Campinas City, SP, Brazil over a 19 -month period. Fifty-one M. tuberculosis isolates from these inmates were characterized according to the number of IS 6110 <b>insertion</b> <b>elements</b> present in their genomic DNA. The number of <b>insertion</b> <b>elements</b> in M. tuberculosis isolates varied from two to twelve. The dendrogram of similarity resulted in the grouping the isolates in six main clusters. These results, associated to epidemiological data, suggested the transmission of tuberculosis among inmates of the same and different institutions inmates. Univariate analysis of epidemiological data (total delay for beginning of treatment, previous treatment, and HIV status) and clustering occurrence showed that only "previous treatment" (OR = 7. 65, p = 0. 032) was associated with the possible transmission of tuberculosis in the studied prisons...|$|R

40|$|The Porphyromonas gingivalis genome {{contains}} multiple {{copies of}} <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> IS 1126. When chromosomal DNA digests of different strains were probed with IS 1126, between 25 and 35 hybridizing fragments per genome were detected, {{depending on the}} strain. Unrelated strains had very different {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) patterns. When different laboratory copies of a specific strain were examined, the IS 1126 RFLP patterns were very similar but small differences were observed, indicating that element-associated changes had occurred during laboratory passage. Within the next year, genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for P. gingivalis W 83 will be completed. Because repetitive elements complicate the assembly of randomly sequenced DNA fragments, we isolated and sequenced the flanking regions of IS 1126 copies in strain W 83. We also isolated and sequenced the flanking regions of IS 1126 copies in strain ATCC 33277 in order to compare insertion sites in phylogenetically divergent strains. We identified 37 new sequences flanking IS 1126 from strain ATCC 33277 and 30 from strain W 83. The <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> was found between genes except where it transposed into another <b>insertion</b> <b>element.</b> Examination of identifiable flanking genes or open reading frames indicated that the insertion sites were different in the two strains, except that both strains possess an insertion adjacent to the Lys-gingipain gene (J. P. Lewis and F. L. Macrina, Infect. Immun. 66 : 3035 – 3042, 1998). Most of the genes or sequences flanking IS 1126 in ATCC 33277 were present in W 83 but were contiguous and not <b>insertion</b> <b>element</b> associated. Thus, where genes were identified in both strains, their order was maintained, indicating that the two genomes are organized similarly, but the loci of IS 1126 are different. In both strains, insertion element-associated duplicated target sites were lost from several copies of IS 1126, providing evidence of homologous recombination between elements. Larger organizational differences between the genomes, such as deletions and inversions, may result from insertion element-mediated recombination events...|$|E
