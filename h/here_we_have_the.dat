500|$|The book's fiftieth {{anniversary in}} 2007 {{prompted}} a reevaluation {{of the book}} from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in Carousel magazine, wondered if {{the popularity of the}} Cat and his [...] "delicious naughty behavior" [...] will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, [...] "The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another critic wrote [...] "Though {{the project}} was widely {{promoted}} as a Madhuri Dixit film in its entire promotional campaign and print advertisements. But in reality its Juhi Chawla who makes a more killer impact in her first ever role of a vamp unarguably. Hence as an exciting surprise, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> beautiful Juhi in a completely new negative avatar played real well, offering {{a lot more than}} the viewer's expectations from the talented actress. In other words, where Madhuri's decent attempt struggles to make an instant connect due to her mixed language (accent) or all meaningless songs (dances), there Juhi takes the full advantage of this unintentional flaw and emerges as a clear winner in this on-screen contest, evidently." ...|$|E
