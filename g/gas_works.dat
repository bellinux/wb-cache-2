It serviced an area of more than , including parts of Southwark, Croydon, Newington, Lambeth and Streatham. Expansion of the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> in 1868 required the demolition of Christ Church, Camberwell which was built in 1838 and rebuilt {{on the opposite side}} of the road by Livesey. The <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> was managed by Livesey from 1840 until his death in 1908. A statue of him was sited in the rear courtyard of Livesey Museum, opposite the works.|$|E

5|$|Kings Cross {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the <b>Gas</b> <b>Works</b> tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling {{made it easier to}} manage the increasing number of local trains.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton <b>Gas</b> <b>Works</b> in London. The <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the Met {{moved its}} {{carriage}} works from Edgware Road to Neasden. A locomotive works was opened in 1883 and a <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> in 1884. To accommodate employees moving from London over 100 cottages and ten shops were built for rent. In 1883, a school room and church took over {{two of the}} shops; two years later land {{was given to the}} Wesleyan Church for a church building and a school for 200 children.|$|E

5|$|Born in Blackpool, {{a coastal}} town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool <b>Gas</b> <b>Works,</b> {{where he worked}} as a coke-keeper. A spell at nearby Fleetwood followed, during which Swift {{attracted}} interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called up to the first team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.|$|E
5|$|In October filming {{moved to}} other Greek locations, {{including}} Meteora and the Achilleion. In November the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, {{while the second}} unit shot underwater scenes in the Bahamas. On 1 January 1981 production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned Beckton <b>Gas</b> <b>Works</b> in London.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, St Thomas-a-Watering on Old Kent Road was a {{place where}} {{religious}} dissenters and those found guilty of treason were publicly hanged. The road was rural in nature and several coaching inns were built alongside it. In the 19th century it acquired the name Old Kent Road and several industrial premises were set up to close to the Surrey Canal and a major business, the Metropolitan <b>Gas</b> <b>Works</b> was developed. In the 20th century, older property was demolished for redevelopment and Burgess Park was created. The Old Kent Road Baths opened around 1905 had Turkish and Russian bath facilities. In the 21st century, several retail parks and premises typical of out-of-town development have been built beside it while public houses have been redeveloped for other purposes.|$|E

5|$|Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in {{the early}} 1900s {{carrying}} timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> and local paper mills. In 1923 they bought their first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport {{and after the war}} were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Prior to SpaceChem, Zach Barth, the {{designer}} behind Zachtronics Industries, had created several Flash-based browser games with automation puzzles, including The Codex of Alchemical Engineering where the player had to place and program manipulator arms to construct atoms and molecules following {{the rules of}} alchemy. Barth had wanted to expand the ideas in Codex to include more realistic aspects of chemistry, such as more complex molecules, but did not pursue the idea immediately afterwards. About a year after completing Codex, Barth {{was inspired by the}} disused chemical plant at <b>Gas</b> <b>Works</b> Park in Seattle, giving him the idea to incorporate pipelines into the basic mechanics of molecule-building from Codex.|$|E
5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic to the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> ended, {{though there was}} some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the canal}} {{brought about a}} rapid {{development}} in coal mining on the Manchester Coalfield west of Worsley. Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit {{was connected to the}} canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west direction from the canal at Boothstown to the pit. Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge tramroad worked by horses from his Gin Pit Colliery to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The tramroad was later worked by locomotives. In 1867 the Fletchers built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from Howe Bridge onto barges. Astley Green Colliery began winding coal on the north bank of the canal in 1912. In the 1940s and '50s coal was sent to Barton Power Station and Runcorn <b>Gas</b> <b>Works.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s, {{the city}} enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid {{expansion}} beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed {{into one of the}} most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Railway Act 1885 {{had given}} Watkin {{permission}} {{to extend the}} line from Chesham {{to connect with the}} LNWR at Tring. Thus, although it was the terminus of the line, Chesham station was designed with a revival of the LNWR extension scheme in mind. The small station building was set {{to one side of the}} tracks to allow for a possible extension onwards. The station had a single platform, with a run-around loop and turntable alongside, together with a coaling station and water tank. The station was lit by gas light until 1925; the local <b>gas</b> <b>works,</b> which consumed around 5,000tons of coal each year, threatened to withdraw their coal traffic from the line if the station were fitted with electric lighting. While Chalfont Road station initially served a sparsely populated rural area (the village of Little Chalfont had not yet grown around the station), Chesham station was busy, and at the time of its opening had a full staff of a stationmaster, two ticket inspectors, two clerks, two porters and two collectors.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh Poor Law Union {{comprising}} an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick, established on 26 January 1837. A workhouse in Tyldesley was replaced by Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh in the 1850s. Tyldesley was constituted a civil parish in 1866. In 1863 the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted and the township was governed by a local board of health. The first Tyldesley Local Board was formed after elections on 24 October 1863. Among those elected were mill owners, Caleb Wright and Oliver Burton, and colliery owners, William Ramsden and George Green, a mixture of Tories and Liberals. The Local Board took over the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> in 1865, built the first swimming baths and opened Tyldesley Cemetery in 1876 and built sewage works at Morleys Hall in Astley in 1884. The local board offices were in Lower Elliot Street, where it had a fire station and depot. Under the Public Health Act 1875 the local board gained additional powers as an urban sanitary district and under the Local Government Act 1894 Tyldesley-with-Shakerley became an urban district with an elected council. Tyldesley Town Hall, originally the township's Liberal Club, opened in 1881, and was taken over by Tyldesley Urban District Council as its headquarters in 1924. Tyldesley UDC opened Tyldesley Park in 1902, the Carnegie Library officially opened in 1909, and after World War I council housing was built at Sale Lane and Mosley Common and after World War II in Shakerley.|$|E
25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, oil fuel and provisions to the lighthouse and <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points at the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block.
