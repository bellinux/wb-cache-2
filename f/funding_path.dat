It provides an introduction to drop-in replacement biofuels, the options amongst the technologies and feedstock available to produce them, their current economic performance {{and the evolution of}} their commercialization. In pursuing the latter a detailed examination of the <b>funding</b> <b>path</b> towards commercialization was undertaken. The study found that the U. S. Navy's requirements for drop-in replacement biofuels for aviation are best met by hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ). Since feedstock from sources that do not interfere with food markets are preferred, algal oil was identified as extremely promising. The study also found that hydroprocessed fuels are also not yet independently commercially viable. The study identified a critical funding gap between the time startup capital is depleted and prior to reaching the ability to raise capital in the commercial and public markets.

40|$|As long {{as there}} are taxes, the {{incentive}} for evasion will exist as well. Studies for tax evasion are of interest in different fields like that of economics, public finance, personal finance, business administration, business finance, financial accounting, in the banking system etc. However, {{there are only a few}} studies about the internal causes and financial incentives that oblige decision-makers of small firms towards tax evasion. When we refer to business tax evasion, always brings to mind sensational cases of large businesses that evade taxes, but business tax evasion is a widespread phenomenon even to small firms. To be more competitive, small business must have a consistently entrepreneurial orientation, but limited financing prevents this, therefore the business savings from tax evasion is believed to be an internally <b>funding</b> <b>path.</b> The restrictions on small firms financing often make them orientate more toward internal generation of funds, which also has few alternatives. As a way to internal saving, firms often find tax evasion, which is not only a deviant and unethical behavior, but also puts firms into many difficulties in the long run. Consequently, the study aims to discuss the phenomenon of tax evasion in the managerial practice of small business in an Albanian region, as well as its financial cause as is perceived by the small business. The study findings report that the deviant behavior of businesses from taxes considers the need for internal financing as an important reason. The study concluded that savings from tax evasion is an alternative of internal financing primarily for small and early-staged firms, and that if entrepreneurs are capable of a good business model and competitive strategy, they will not need to make evasion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the twenty}} {{years that have}} passed since the fabled Friday Harbor {{meetings}} of November 1993, where GIS practitioners and critical human geographers agreed to a cease-fire, the GIS & Society agenda has been reflected upon, pushed forward, and diffracted in few (but intellectually significant) arenas. Critical, participatory, public participation, and feminist GIS have given way more recently to qualitative GIS, GIS and non-representational theory, and the spatial digital humanities. Traveling {{at the margins of}} these efforts has been a kind of social history of mapping and GIS. And while GIScience has been conversant and compatible with many of these permutations in the GIS & Society agenda, a social history of mapping and GIS (as signaled most directly by John Pickles in 2004) has perhaps the least potential for tinkering with GIScience practice (see conversation between Agnieszka Leszczynski and Jeremy Crampton in 2009). Perhaps this disconnect is growing, as can be witnessed in the feverish emergence of a ‘big data’ analytics/visualization perspective within the contemporary GISciences (alongside the growth of <b>funding</b> <b>paths</b> around cyberinfrastructure). What then is the relevance and role of a social history of GIS for GIScience practice? In this viewpoint, I sketch and reflect upon a diversity of efforts that address this question. Perhaps I enter this social space of silence by living in the world as I found it. A world where the unconscious is structured as a language, a world where power is structured as a knowledge, a world where lines are taken to their limits. (Olsso...|$|R

Employing real-time data and using the Taylor rule as an analytical framework, I explore the implications of utilizing alternative observable proxies for the unobservable output gap. I compare the counterfactual paths for the federal funds rate generated under each proxy with the actual path of the federal funds rate and a benchmark ("ideal") path implied by a full information Taylor rule. Results suggest that these real-time proxies would have resulted in better policy outcomes than actually occurred. Indeed, the federal <b>funds</b> rate <b>path</b> that comes closest to the ideal path occurs when the estimate of the output gap is taken to be zero (its steady-state value) at every point in time.

Moreover, we estimate a nested model to take both interest rate smoothing and serially correlated deviations from various Taylor rates prescriptions into account. Our findings suggest that the lagged interest rate enters the Taylor rule in its own right, and may very well coexist with (usually omitted) variables that relate to asymmetric preferences on the output gap, or financial market indicators. Therefore, while we cannot exclude that serially correlated policy shocks {{may play a role in}} describing the federal <b>funds</b> rate <b>path,</b> our results significantly support the importance of the lagged interest rate in Taylor-type models.

These scientists with managerial function often bear resemblance with the “mogul” type in Etzkowitz’s typology, as they see themselves and are described by others as strong leaders in shaping not only their own ventures and firms, but creating new institutional infrastructures for research commercialization (Etzkowitz 1997 : 146).|$|R
40|$|The latest {{economic}} and financial crisis has shown how quickly vulnerabilities on the financial side of the economy can turn into a strong deterioration of public accounts, thus highlighting the importance to monitor fiscal risks arising {{outside the realm of}} public finances. This is particularly the case for the building up of risks in the banking sector, due to its central role in financial stability. In this spirit, this paper presents banking stress-test scenarios for public debt projections based on SYMBOL, a Monte Carlo micro-simulation model that allows obtaining losses from simulated bank defaults, using actual bank balance-sheet information. The estimated bank losses are used to assess the size of the potential impact on government deficit and gross public debt that feed into a debt projection model, allowing drawing conclusions in terms of projected public debt dynamics. The methodology for the stress tests proposed here has three major advantages. First, it allows distinguishing between simulated bank losses and bank recapitalisation needs (particularly relevant in that public funds used to cover the latter could be recouped later by selling the financial assets acquired). Secondly, through the use of bank-level balance-sheet data, countryspecific features of national banking systems are accounted for, while remaining within a common conceptual framework. Thirdly, the approach allows reflecting in the designed stress tests the institutional changes (bail-in, elements of Basel III, the resolution <b>fund)</b> along the <b>path</b> leading to the full implementation of the banking union legislation.

40|$|Quarrying in {{limestone}} aquifers {{can interfere}} with groundwater flow paths. Quarries can pirate karst conduit flow by physically breaking into the conduits and changing the groundwater discharge points. Another mechanism of groundwater flow interference occurs as quarry dewatering lowers the water table changing groundwater flow directions. Dye tracing is an effective tool to evaluate and quantify these impacts. In Minnesota, tracing investigations have been conducted at two quarries. The Big Spring quarry near Harmony, Minnesota is in the Ordovician Galena Formation. The quarry is 500 meters from Big Spring, the headwater spring of Camp Creek, a Minnesota designated trout stream. Although the quarry is nominally above the water table, beginning about forty years ago, the quarry intercepted conduits carrying groundwater to the spring. Groundwater that formerly discharged from Big Spring now rises in the quarry then flows overland joining Camp Creek 100 meters downstream of Big Spring. About 90 percent of the mapped groundwater basin of Big Spring is now routed through the quarry. The Osmundson quarry is in the Devonian Lithograph City Formation at LeRoy, Minnesota. This sub-water table quarry requires seasonal dewatering at 1, 000 - 3, 000 liters/minute. When the quarry is being dewatered, Sweets Spring, approximately 300 meters to the southeast, stops flowing. Dye tracing has verified that the quarry pirates the flow to the spring. Both of these cases demonstrate the utility of using dye traces to determine the impact of limestone quarrying on groundwater flow paths. This information {{can be used to}} evaluate proposed quarry sites for their potential alterations of groundwater flow <b>paths.</b> <b>Funding</b> for this research has been provided by the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund and by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources-Division of Water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The revised International Health Regulations [IHR(2005) ], which {{requires}} the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop core capacities to detect, assess, report, {{and respond to}} public health threats, is bringing new challenges for national and international surveillance systems. As more countries move toward implementation and/or strengthening of their infectious disease surveillance programs, the strengthening of clinical microbiology laboratories becomes increasingly important because they serve as the first line responders to detect new and emerging microbial threats, re-emerging infectious diseases, the spread of antibiotic resistance, {{and the possibility of}} bioterrorism. In fact, IHR(2005) Core Capacity # 8, “Laboratory”, requires that laboratory services be a part of every phase of alert and response. Public health laboratories in many resource-constrained countries require financial and technical assistance to build their capacity. In recognition of this, in 2006, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established an International Laboratory Capacity Building Program, LabCap, housed under the ASM International Board. ASM LabCap utilizes ASM’s vast resources and its membership’s expertise— 40, 000 microbiologists worldwide—to strengthen clinical and public health laboratory systems in low and low-middle income countries. ASM LabCap’s program activities align with HR(2005) by building the capability of resource-constrained countries to develop quality-assured, laboratory-based information which is critical to disease surveillance and the rapid detection of disease outbreaks, whether they stem from natural, deliberate or accidental causes. ASM LabCap helps build laboratory capacity under a cooperative agreement with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and under a sub-contract with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (<b>PATH)</b> <b>funded</b> by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Successful activities of ASM LabCap have occurred throughout Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, ASM LabCap coordinates efforts with international agencies such as the WHO in order to maximize resources and ensure a unified response, with the intended goal to help build integrated disease surveillance and response capabilities worldwide in compliance with HR(2005) ’s requirements. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{candidate}} {{malaria vaccine}} RTS,S/AS 01 E has entered phase 3 trials, but data on long-term outcomes are limited. METHODS: For 4 years, we followed {{children who had}} been randomly assigned, at 5 to 17 months of age, to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS 01 E vaccine (223 children) or rabies vaccine (224 controls). The end point was clinical malaria (temperature of ≥ 37. 5 °C and Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia density of > 2500 parasites per cubic millimeter). Each child's exposure to malaria was estimated {{with the use of the}} distance-weighted local prevalence of malaria. RESULTS: Over a period of 4 years, 118 of 223 children who received the RTS,S/AS 01 E vaccine and 138 of 224 of the controls had at least 1 episode of clinical malaria. Vaccine efficacies in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 29. 9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 10. 3 to 45. 3; P= 0. 005) and 32. 1 % (95 % CI, 11. 6 to 47. 8; P= 0. 004), respectively, calculated by Cox regression. Multiple episodes were common, with 551 and 618 malarial episodes in the RTS,S/AS 01 E and control groups, respectively; vaccine efficacies in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 16. 8 % (95 % CI, - 8. 6 to 36. 3; P= 0. 18) and 24. 3 % (95 % CI, 1. 9 to 41. 6; P= 0. 04), respectively, calculated by the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox model. For every 100 vaccinated children, 65 cases of clinical malaria were averted. Vaccine efficacy declined over time (P= 0. 004) and with increasing exposure to malaria (P= 0. 001) in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccine efficacy was 43. 6 % (95 % CI, 15. 5 to 62. 3) in the first year but was - 0. 4 % (95 % CI, - 32. 1 to 45. 3) in the fourth year. Among children with a malaria-exposure index that was average or lower than average, the vaccine efficacy was 45. 1 % (95 % CI, 11. 3 to 66. 0), but among children with a malaria-exposure index that was higher than average it was 15. 9 % (95 % CI, - 11. 0 to 36. 4). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of RTS,S/AS 01 E vaccine over the 4 -year period was 16. 8 %. Efficacy declined over time and with increasing malaria exposure.

The Governments had tried to eliminate the poverty from rural communities with the assistance of donor agencies through out many decades, but the success of these attempts is still doubtful. Donor agencies, as well as the Government have identified "Lack of energy supply to the rural areas" {{is one of the major}} obstacles to achieve the goals of these attempts. Government with the assistance of the donor agencies such as World Bank has introduced village hydro electrification projects as an option for rural electrification. The main objective of the Government is to eradicate the poverty and up grade the life standards of rural community by the growth of rural economy as a result of electrification in rural areas. This research is an attempt to evaluate whether the objectives of the village hydro projects (objectives of the Government, objectives of the Funding Agencies and expectation of the rural community) have been achieved or if not identifies the drawbacks of village hydro project industry.

For the purpose of data collection, three case studies have been done base on three village hydro projects, which have been <b>funded</b> by Sam <b>path</b> Bank. The reasons to select these three projects are availability of resources and easy access. Data were collected by literature survey on three projects, using a questionnaire and face to face interviews conducted with selected samples of villagers in these areas. Questionnaire was given to three samples of (minimum 30 each) villagers of above three projects. Data of social impact and drawbacks of these projects were collected by face to face interviews with selected samples of villagers.

40|$|I am {{delighted to}} have this {{opportunity}} to introduce the 2014 collection of Environmental Studies Independent Research Projects. Environmental Studies 4950 is quintessentially a fourth-year course for seniorwith the helpful guidance of their supervisors. In this process, each student {{has the opportunity to}} research an environmental issue of their choice by applying the knowledge and methodological skills they have acquired during their undergraduate experience. The Environmental Studies Program at Grenfell Campus is an interdisciplinary program focused on the environment. It strives to demonstrate through its teaching and research endeavours that it embraces numerous disciplines and brings knowledge from these various areas together into a broad synthesis of understanding. The papers in each year’s collection of student projects are good examples of our program’s diversity and the keen interest our students have in examining environmental problems from different perspectives. The students choose topics that they want to examine, complete literature reviews, identify topical relationships and contradictions in the literature and, in many cases, conduct original research in the form of surveys and/or interviews followed by quantitative data analyses. This year’s collection of Environmental Studies student independent projects includes six research papers:  A SWOT Analysis of the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement and Natural Disturbances in the Boreal Forest and Protected Areas, by Mr. Brandon Curry.  Social Impacts of Large-Scale Natural Resource Development in Canada’s Northern Indigenous Communities, by Miss Shena Fowler.  Green Revolving <b>Funds</b> and the <b>Path</b> to Sustainability for Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland, by Mr. Glen Keeling.  Popular Media Discourse Surrounding Issues of Labeling and the Human and Environmental Health Impacts of Genetically Modified and Non-Organic Food, by Miss Kelly Keresteci.  Wind Energy Policy in Newfoundland and Labrador: Harnessing North America’s Greatest Energy Resource. A SWOT Analysis and Policy Recommendations, by Mr. Nicholas M. J. Mercer. These research papers deal with timely and important environmental topics which are relevant either for our Province, or for Canada, or for the world in general. The research papers are scientifically sound and our students’ treatment of their topics is original and refreshing. We hope that their conclusions will be useful for informing the decision-making processes concerning various environmental issues which need attention now or in the future.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis research were to synthesize {{and develop a}} new type of nanostructured, ion-conductive material utilizing lyotropic (i. e., amphiphilic) liquid crystals (LLCs) as starting materials, in order to solve some inherent limitations and problems with current polymer electrolyte materials used in Li battery applications. Some of these limitations include poor low- temperature performance, high flammable liquid loadings, lower than desired energy density, lithium dendrite formation, and poor charge-discharge cycling. The first part of this research was focused on the design and synthesis of a new lithium-ion-containing polymerizable LLC that could self-assemble and be cross-linked into a bicontinuous cubic (Q) LLC phase {{in the presence of a}} conventional liquid electrolyte used in battery manufacture, instead of the typical solvent used in LLC phase formation, water. The presence of Li ions in the LLC monomer and the 3 D-interconnected solvent nanopore structure of the targeted Q phase were both important for ensuring high Li-ion conductivity over a range of conditions in the resulting material. A non-aqueous LLC monomer system with these features was unprecedented prior to this work. Some secondary considerations in the design of this non-aqueous LLC monomer system were the use of inexpensive, industrially friendly, and readily available reactants, reagents, and reactions so that it would be attractive for potential future commercialization, if successful. To this end, a new three-tailed acrylate LLC monomer based on a gallic acid core with a tethered lithium sulfonate headgroup was successfully synthesized. After structural characterization and purity analysis, this monomer was found by polarized light microscopy (PLM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to form LLC phases with water and separately propylene carbonate (PC), a known battery liquid electrolyte. The phases formed in each solvent included a lamellar (L) phase and a well-defined type II (i. e., inverted) bicontinuous cubic (QII) phase, as well as several other unidentified mixed LLC phases. UV light-initiated radical photopolymerization of the acrylate groups of the monomer afforded cross-linked networks with retention of the original LLC phase structures. The system formed with PC as the liquid component provided the first example in the literature of LLC phase formation and polymerization around a known battery liquid electrolyte. The cross-linked QII-phase network formed with pure PC was then tested using AC impedance spectroscopy to determine ion conductivity. The room-temperature ion conductivity of this material was found to be to be just under 10 - 6 S cm- 1 which is below the value typically required for battery applications (¡Ý 10 - 4 S cm- 1). Subsequently, the PC was doped with a small amount of a free lithium salt (0. 254 M LiClO 4), which is common practice in the Li battery community for increasing the Li-ion conductivity of an electrolyte material, The lithium sulfonate LLC monomer was found to exhibit similar phase formation behavior and polymerization characteristics when 0. 245 M LiClO 4 in PC was used instead of pure PC as the LLC solvent. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the cross-linked QII-phase LLC system formed around 0. 245 M LiClO 4 in PC was found to be in the range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 3 S cm- 1. Variable-temperature (VT) AC impedance spectroscopy experiments were also carried out to determine ionic conductivity as a function of temperature because conventional Li- battery polymer electrolyte materials based on poly(ethylene oxide) drop significantly at low temperatures due to the glass transition of the polymer matrix [...] These VT conductivity studies provided unexpected positive results in that the QII-phase, cross-linked LLC-(0. 245 M LiClO 4 -PC) nanocomposite material exhibited less than 1 order of magnitude change in ionic conductivity when cooled to ¨C 65 ¡ãC and heated up to 55 ¡ãC. Additional NMR DOSY studies on the material were performed to provide evidence of low-temperature mobility of the doped electrolyte within the nanostructured channels of the cross-linked QII-phase. These studies corroborated that the doped PC solution in the LLC nanochannels was still mobile down to ¨C 35 ¡ãC. A lithium metal battery was successfully made to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the efficacy of this ion-conductive membrane in battery operation using a proprietary cathode material provided by an outside battery company. A single-discharge lithium metal test battery employing the LLC-PC electrolyte material provided a voltage of just over 3 V upon testing, which demonstrates that it can function as a battery electrolyte and membrane separator. Research after this point was focused on evaluating the effect of several additional, known, battery liquid electrolytes and lithium salts on LLC phase behavior and ionic conductivity performance of the final polymerized composite material. Diethylcarbonate (DEC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) were chosen for the next evaluation because they are also common battery electrolyte solvents typically used in lithium-containing batteries. In fact, doped DEC and DMC or mixtures of the two are used more than PC in the lithium battery industry. Other Li salts such as LiBF 4, LiPF 6, LiOTf, and LiTf 2 N are commonly employed as dopants in lithium-containing batteries. LiBF 4 and LiPF 6 were chosen as the salts for further analysis in combination with PC, DEC, and DMC as the liquid electrolytes with the LLC monomer, although LiPF 6 was used in a limited fashion due to its tendency to form HF under certain conditions. It was found that high loading level mixed phase morphology LLC composites performed as good as the pure QII-phase composite. This was not unexpected as many highly liquid-loaded composite materials. Generally, no discernable trends or unusually results were found. Generally high liquid loadings and high dopant salt concentrations result in better conductivity levels, which is not novel. What is still notable is that the pure QII-phase composite performs as well as or better than the 50 wt% loading level LLC composites, which are on the edge of macrophase separation, and at electrolyte levels nearly 70 % less. Eight of the outstanding composite samples were selected and assembled into working Li-metal batteries. As expected the QII-phase samples performed very well, as did the high liquid loading level composites. With these formulation variation results in hand, the final part of this thesis work was centered on modifying the design of the original lithium sulfonate LLC monomer to give it potentially better thermal and chemical stability for potential long-term use in batteries. Thermal and chemical stability were of concern due to the acrylate decomposition temperature and the hydrolyzable ester linkage on the tails. Consequently, 1, 3 -diene- and isoprene-terminated tails were synthesized to replace the original long acrylate tails on the LLC monomer. Unfortunately, the isoprene-terminated tails were not successfully coupled onto the desired substrate. Due to time and <b>funding</b> this parallel <b>path</b> investigation was stopped. The 1, 3 -diene tails were successfully coupled onto the respective substrate and the monomer synthesized. The initial LLC phase behavior and photopolymerization characteristics of the new monomer with LiClO 4 -doped PC solution were then investigated and found to be promising for future work and optimization...|$|R
