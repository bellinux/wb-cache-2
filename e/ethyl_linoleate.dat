Polyamines, such as 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyl triethylenetetramine (HMTETA) in a complex with manganese, accelerate the oxidation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> (Oyman et al. 2004). Likewise, another polyamine 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (MeTACN) forms a complex with manganese(IV) (MnMeTACN) that catalyses the oxidation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> (Oyman et al. 2004).

Our {{objective was to}} measure meconium FAEE in fetal sheep following daily, relatively moderate-dose ethanol exposure in late gestation, and to evaluate their utility in identifying fetal organ-system injury. Pregnant ewes received ethanol (0. 75 g/kg; n =  14) or saline (n =  8) via 1 -h i. v. infusion daily during the third trimester equivalent, while additional pregnant sheep served as untreated controls (n =  6). The daily ethanol regimen produced similar maximal maternal and fetal plasma ethanol concentrations of 0. 11 - 0. 12 g/dL. Ewes and fetuses were euthanized shortly before term, and meconium was collected and analyzed for FAEE (<b>ethyl</b> palmitate, stearate, <b>linoleate,</b> and oleate). Meconium total FAEE concentration was significantly higher in ethanol-exposed fetuses compared with controls, and a positive cut-off of 0. 0285 nmol total FAEE/g meconium had 93. 3 % sensitivity and specificity for detecting fetal ethanol exposure. When the studied animals (ethanol-exposed and controls) were classified according to meconium FAEE concentration, FAEE-positive and FAEE-negative groups frequently differed with respect to previously examined pathological endpoints, including nephron endowment, lung collagen deposition, cardiomyocyte maturation, and tropoelastin gene expression in cerebral vessels. Furthermore, in all studied animals as a group (ethanol-exposed and controls combined), meconium FAEE concentration was correlated with many of these pathological endpoints in fetal organs. We conclude that, in fetal sheep, meconium FAEE {{could serve as a}} biomarker of daily ethanol exposure in late gestation and could identify fetuses with subtle ethanol-induced toxic effects in various organs. This study illustrates the potential for using meconium FAEE to identify neonates at risk for dysfunction of major organs following in-utero ethanol exposure that does not result in overt physical signs of ethanol teratogenicity...|$|R
30|$|Size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) {{is particularly}} suitable to analyse {{the product of}} the polymerisation reaction of linseed oil involving its active constituents. It was employed to observe the polymerisation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> in the presence of Co(acac) 2 /additive mixture (Tanase et al. 2004) and the oligomerisation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> catalysed by 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (MnMeTACN/HMTETA) (Oyman et al. 2004). During the first day of drying, oligomer formation was observed relatively quickly for the oxidation reaction of <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> in the presence of cobalt/calcium/zirconium dryers. No significant change in the oligomeric distribution occurred on further drying (Muizebelt et al. 1994). This method quantitates the abundances of hydroperoxides, dimers, trimers and higher oligomers, providing information about rates of cross linking reactions (Wu et al. 2004). By applying SEC, Lazzari et al. identified the peak eluting at 32.5 [*]min as corresponding to the formation of dimers. These researchers reported that the weight of the sample increased up to a maximum of 7 % after 20 [*]h of oxidation at a constant temperature of 80 °C (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999). This increase could be related to the incorporation of oxygen that manifests itself by fast accumulation of insoluble fractions as a result of cross-linking reactions. The formation of small amounts of volatiles caused the weight to decrease after 20 [*]h treatment (Lazzari & Chiantore 1999).|$|E

30|$|There are {{literature}} {{reports on the}} mechanistic differences between the oxidation of conjugated and non-conjugated fatty acids. The H abstraction rate of non-conjugated fatty acid is faster {{than that of the}} conjugated acids. This is because of resonance stabilisation of conjugated double bonds and also the presence of trans double bonds (Muizebelt et al. 2000). For example, conjugated <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> is estimated to be 12 – 17 [*]kJ[*]mol- 1 more stable than non-conjugated <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> (Muizebelt et al. 2000). For comparison, radicals arising from H abstraction from non-conjugated fatty acids are stabilised by resonance. This results in lower abundance of peroxide species present in oils containing conjugated fatty acids (Oyman et al. 2005 a). Polymerisation reactions can occur by direct addition of free radicals to the conjugated double bonds and by radical recombination (Oyman et al. 2005 a). Conjugated fatty acids tend to favour radical addition to double bonds, whereas non-conjugated species prefer to enter into radical recombination reactions (Muizebelt et al. 2000).|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in meconium of term newborns {{has been described}} as one potential biomarker of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. FAEEs accumulate in multiple alcohol-exposed fetal tissues and in the placenta. Limited research has focused on the identification of the premature newborn exposed to alcohol in utero. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol use occurs in a significant proportion of premature deliveries and that this exposure can be detected as elevated placental FAEEs. The goals of this study were to 1) determine the prevalence of maternal alcohol use in the premature newborn and 2) investigate whether placental FAEEs could identify those newborns with fetal alcohol exposure. This prospective observational study evaluated 80 placentas from 80 women after premature delivery. Subjects were interviewed for alcohol intake and placental FAEEs were quantified via GC/MS. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curves were generated to evaluate the ability of placental FAEEs to predict maternal drinking during pregnancy. Adjusted ROC curves were generated to adjust for gestational age, maternal smoking, and illicit drug use. 30 % of the subjects admitted to drinking alcohol during pregnancy and approximately 14 % answered questions indicative of problem drinking (designated AUDIT+). The specific FAEEs <b>ethyl</b> stearate and <b>linoleate,</b> as well as combinations of oleate + linoleate + linolenate (OLL) and of OLL + stearate, were significantly (p< 0. 05) elevated in placentas from AUDIT+ pregnancies. Adjusted ROC Curves generated areas under the curve ranging from 88 - 93 % with negative predictive values of 97 % for AUDIT+ pregnancies. We conclude that nearly one third of premature pregnancies were alcohol-exposed, and that elevated placental FAEEs hold great promise to accurately determine maternal alcohol use, particularly heavy use, in pregnancies complicated by premature delivery...|$|R

Compared to the direct esterification of rutin with linoleic acid, its transesterification with <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> exhibited a lower conversion (50 %). The enzymatic acylation of rutin and naringin is regioselective since only monoesters were identified. Additionally, the ability of both flavonoids and their esters to modulate the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulator of tumor-induced angiogenesis, was examined in K 562 lymphoblastorna cell line. Compared to the effect of parental molecules, rutin and individual fatty acids, the synthesized esters were more efficient in reducing the release of VEGF from K 562 cells indicating that they might possess improved anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties.

30|$|Linseed oil {{has found}} {{numerous}} applications in painting, varnishes, wood treatment and linoleum {{due to its}} drying properties. However, {{in the presence of}} a metal catalyst, the oxidation of linseed oil soaked into lignocellulosic materials, such as cotton rags, may induce their spontaneous heating. As a consequence of the importance of the unsaturated fatty acid (present in linseed oil as triacylglycerols) to nutrition, several studies have been undertaken to investigate the oxidation of the active components in linseed oil; often deploying surrogate compounds, such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> These studies led to establishing a generally good understanding of the overall radical chain reactions that operate in the oxidation process. The chemical reactions involve initiation, propagation and termination steps. They comprise oxygen addition to the radicals, formation of hydroperoxides, which are known to be important intermediates, and decomposition of peroxides leading to the formation of volatile organic species and higher molecular weight compounds. However, critical details have eluded comprehension, such as the emergence of the initial radicals, the detailed mechanistic understanding of important chemical species observed in experiments, or the role of most of the transition metals suspected to induce catalytic enhancement of the oxidation reactions.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Trichomoniasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sexually {{transmitted}} diseases in humans and is caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Nowadays, increasing resistance to drugs such as metronidazole resulted in many problem, so new effective remedies are needed. In this study, we evaluate constituents of essential oil and anti-trichomonas activity of Rheum ribes. Materials and Methods: The essential oil from Rheum ribes L. flower growing wild in Iran was analyzed by GC/MS. The parasites were treated with different extract and fractions of the flower, stem, and leave of the plant. Anti-trichomonas activity was evaluated using an in vitro assay.   Results: In all, 19 compounds were identified; palmitic acid [27. 08 %], n-eicosane [9. 9 %], n-tetracosane [7. 34 %], linoleic acid [6. 56 %], and <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> [4. 76 %] were the main components of the oil. Rheum ribes extracts and fractions concentration dependently inhibited the ability of parasites to growth. This was associated with polarity of solvent used for fractionation and plant parts used for extraction. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the potential of Rheum ribes extracts as an anti-trichomonas agent for human use. Further studies are required to evaluate its toxicity and safety. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mountain-{{cultivated}} ginseng (MCG) {{and cultivated}} ginseng (CG) both belong to Panax ginseng and have similar ingredients. However, their pharmacological activities are different {{due to their}} significantly different growth environments. Methods: An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) -based approach was developed to distinguish MCG and CG. Multivariate statistical methods, such as principal component analysis and supervised orthogonal partial-least-squares discrimination analysis were used to select the influential components. Results: Under optimized UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS conditions, 40 ginsenosides in both MCG and CG were unambiguously identified and tentatively assigned. The {{results showed that the}} characteristic components of CG and MCG included ginsenoside Ra 3 /isomer, gypenoside XVII, quinquenoside R 1, ginsenoside Ra 7, notoginsenoside Fe, ginsenoside Ra 2, ginsenoside Rs 6 /Rs 7, malonyl ginsenoside Rc, malonyl ginsenoside Rb 1, malonyl ginsenoside Rb 2, palmitoleic acid, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> The malony ginsenosides are abundant in CG, but higher levels of the minor ginsenosides were detected in MCG. Conclusion: This {{is the first time that}} the differences between CG and MCG have been observed systematically at the chemical level. Our results suggested that using the identified characteristic components as chemical markers to identify different ginseng products is effective and viable...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt present, a {{large number}} of studies of {{biodiesel}} production process using simulation packages are being developed. In these studies, vegetable oils and biodiesels are characterized in the software through representative compounds because of they are not in the compounds database of commercial simulators. With the aim to achieve a successfully characterization in these kinds of software, some properties of the substances must be available. The normal boiling point (NBP) is the most important property {{due to the fact that}} this property along with group contribution methods allows other properties calculation such as, e. g., critical properties and temperature dependency properties. In this work, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method for rapid measurement of normal boiling points of two triacylglycerols and four ethyl esters, i. e., triolein, tripalmitin, ethyl oleate, ethyl palmitate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and ethyl ricinoleate, was used. Nowadays, in the open literature exists few data available about ethyl esters properties; hence, the results obtained here will contribute in the proposal, analysis, and evaluation of ethyl esters (biodiesel) virtual plants using reliable simulation packages. In addition, a more accurate characterization of compounds and therefore more accurate simulation results can be obtained when they are used...|$|E
