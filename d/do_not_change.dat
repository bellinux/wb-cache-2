5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change,</b> opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E

5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> {{throughout the course}} of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> hands through count-out.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} key {{properties of the}} six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> sign for the antiquarks.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change.)</b> The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the pay-per-view, Punk {{cashed in}} his Money in the Bank {{contract}} to defeat Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Punk retained his title in a Triple Threat match against both Edge and Hardy eight days later on the June 15 episode of Raw. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the referee; in the storyline Punk injured his eye and said that he could not see the referee. Because titles <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> hands on a disqualification, Punk retained the championship. Hardy called Punk's eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned. Punk turned heel, claiming to be the moral superior of those who support Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. At Night of Champions, Punk lost the championship to Hardy. Their feud continued through SummerSlam, where Punk regained the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; afterward, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser agreed to leave the company.|$|E
