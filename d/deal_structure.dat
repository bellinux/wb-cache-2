2500|$|Several Dynegy {{executives}} were later convicted or indicted for {{their roles in}} Dynegy's near-collapse. [...] In June 2003, Jamie Olis (former Senior Director of Tax Planning), Gene Foster (former Vice President for Taxation), and Helen Sharkey (a former employee in Dynegy's risk control and <b>deal</b> <b>structure</b> groups), were indicted on numerous counts of mail and wire fraud. According to court documents, the three employees conceived of a plan in early 2001 to borrow money but {{make it look like}} operational revenue. [...] A corporation known as ABG Gas Supply was created. [...] ABG secured loans from Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Deutsche Bank to buy natural gas at market prices. ABG then sold this gas at a discount to Dynegy, which resold it at market prices and booked a $300 million profit. [...] ABG then bought natural gas at market prices, and sold it at a premium to Dynegy. [...] The profits ABG booked were then used to repay the loans. [...] Prosecutors accused Olis, Foster, and Sharkey of deceiving auditors, regulators, and other company executives regarding the transactions. Foster and Sharkey plead guilty two months later. Olis was found guilty in March 2004, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. (A year later, after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the Constitution, Olis' sentence was reduced to just six years in prison.) In December 2003, three former executives at Nicor Energy LLC (a joint venture of Dynegy and Nicor), were indicted for illegally manipulating that firm's income by US$11 million in 2001 to hide losses. Former chief financial officer Robert Doty agreed to pay a $376,650 fine in October 2007 for his role in helping to conceal the ABG Gas Supply scheme.|$|E

40|$|Credit {{granting}} businesses face {{a challenging}} environment {{due to the}} wide variety of customer behaviors. While only some customers use their credit and pay regularly, a larger percentage may hardly use their available credit. As a key risk management issue, small percentages of customers become delinquent in their payments, and others become bankrupt, requiring write-off. As a business decides upon the <b>deal</b> <b>structure</b> (credit line, repayment erms, interest rate, etc.) of a customer, that business needs to optimize the <b>deal</b> <b>structure</b> considering the uncertainty of that customer’s behavior. We have developed a framework for credit customer optimization based on clustering and prediction. First customer clusters are formed by using hierarchical clustering from past credit performance data.

40|$|Following {{abundant}} {{anecdotal evidence}} of low morale in mergers and its im-portant detrimental effect on postmerger performance, {{the purpose of}} this multimethod experimental study was to fi nd out how employee reactions to a merger evolve over time following peer interaction (i. e., discussion with col-leagues). Using a scenario study, initial reactions to a merger announcement were compared with socially infl uenced reactions. As anticipated, an overall strong detrimental effect of peer interaction on employee reactions was ob-served. Next, fi ndings indicate that deal characteristics (culture clash poten-tial, announced degree of integration, and position in <b>deal</b> <b>structure)</b> play a moderating role. Indeed, how peer interaction affects outcomes depends on the position in the <b>deal</b> <b>structure.</b> Qualitative data analysis of the group dis-cussions sheds light on how employee reactions become more detrimental. This process is conceptualized as “collective rumination, ” defi ned as repeti-tively and passively discussing organizational problems and their negative consequences with a group of peers.

40|$|Fast {{growth of}} the Pakistani economy in recent years, which coincides with the upsurge of Islamic {{financial}} industry, has created huge investment opportunities in the new ventures and development projects inside the country.

Although both the Islamic and conventional banks co-exist in the country and are trying to tap this huge market but they have not yet looked into the possibility of cooperation between the two systems. A risk-sharing mechanism between Islamic and conventional banks can be seen as a good alternative for availing these investment opportunities. This paper strives to present a few <b>deal</b> <b>structures</b> that can bridge the two financial systems not only for attracting Islamic but also conventional money from other countries to Pakistan.

We test this theoretical construct in an empirical investigation of the consolidating UK alcoholic beverages firms between 1985 and 2005. In this era Diageo was formed from the landmark merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness. Subsequently Diageo acquired the former international spirits empire of Seagram in partnership with a major competitor. Successful implementation of Diageo’s merger strategy owed much to an ability to navigate the evolving multijurisdictional co‐ordinated oversight of cross‐border mergers and acquisitions.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{describe}} how Estonian venture capitalists make financing and investment decisions, and compare these results with theoretical recommendations found in corporate finance and venture capital literature. The {{focus is on the}} methodological procedures in venture capital investment and financing. A case study approach is used to collect information about the current practice of venture capital investments and financing in Estonia. Five of the largest Estonian venture capital funds were analyzed in this article, and different problems have been presented in the article. Some of them require an academic and some a practical solution. The problems are divided into four parts: venture capital <b>deal</b> <b>structuring,</b> corporate governance and investor protection, the cost of venture capital and valuation. Venture capital <b>deal</b> <b>structuring</b> is discussed first, and we look at of the following topics: syndication, staged investment, use of financial instruments, ownership share and dilution problems. Syndication of investments, staged investments and convertible financial instruments are used quite rarely by Estonian venture capitalists. Most Estonian venture capitalists take a minority holding in their portfolio companies and the ownership share changes mainly due to the use of convertible instruments and financial options. Estonian venture capitalists do not consider this kind of dilution a big problem. Most Estonian venture capitalists do not have a measure of the required rate of return as considered in financial theory. The determination of the rate of return among Estonian venture capitalists is more intuitive: they use an internal rate of return instead. The required rates of return used by Estonian venture capitalists have about the same interval as {{in the rest of the}} world. Corporate control and investor protection are important issues in the venture capital process. These are closely linked to <b>deal</b> <b>structuring.</b> The Estonian Commercial code has average investor protection, but it restricts the use of preferred shares, which are often used in venture capital <b>deal</b> <b>structuring</b> abroad. Some corporate control problems have arisen at the board level in Estonia. Although venture capitalists do not use complicated models to find the cost of capital, they pay much more attention to complicated valuation models. Multiples, book value, and DCF methods are used. Numerical analysis is not as important as the authors expected. Much attention is paid to the linkages between these themes. ...|$|R

40|$|Venture capital (VC) {{investment}} {{has long been}} conceptualized as a local business, in which the VC’s ability to source, syndicate, fund, monitor, and add value to portfolio firms critically depends on their access to knowledge obtained through their ties to the local (i. e., geographically proximate) network. Consistent with the view that local networks matter, existing research confirms that local and geographically distant portfolio firms are sourced, syndicated, funded, and monitored differently. Curiously, emerging research on VC investment practice within the United States finds that distant investments, as measured by “exits” (either initial public offering or merger & acquisition) out-perform local investments. These findings raise important questions about the assumed benefits of local network membership and proximity. To more deeply probe these questions, we contrast the <b>deal</b> <b>structure</b> of cross-border VC investment with domestic VC investment, and contrast the <b>deal</b> <b>structure</b> of cross-border VC investments that include a local partner with those that do not. Evidence from 139, 892 rounds of venture capital financing in the period 1980 - 2009 suggests that cross-border investment practice, in terms of deal sourcing, syndication, and performance indeed change with proximity, but that monitoring practices do not. Further, {{we find that the}} inclusion of a local partner in the investment syndicate yields surprisingly few benefits. This evidence, we argue, raises important questions about VC investment practice as well as the ability of firms to capture and lever the presumed benefits of network membership...|$|E
