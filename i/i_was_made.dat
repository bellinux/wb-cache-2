It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights– Volume <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> public, over forty years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|XXIBomber Command's initial {{attacks against}} Japan {{were focused on}} the country's {{aircraft}} industry. The first attack, codenamed Operation San Antonio <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> against the Musashino aircraft plant in the outskirts of Tokyo on 24November 1944. Only 24 of the 111 B-29s dispatched attacked the primary target, and the others bombed port facilities as well as industrial and urban areas. The Americans were intercepted by 125 Japanese fighters but only one B-29 was shot down. This attack caused some damage to the aircraft plant and further reduced Japanese civilians' confidence in the country's air defenses. In response, the IJAAF and IJN stepped up their air attacks on B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands from 27November; these raids continued until January 1945 and resulted {{in the destruction of}} 11 Superfortresses and damage to another 43 for the loss of probably 37 Japanese aircraft. The IJA also began launching fire balloons against the United States during November. This campaign caused little damage and was abandoned in March 1945. By this time 9,000 balloons had been dispatched but only 285 were reported to have reached the contiguous United States.|$|E

And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
25|$|Broken Walrus <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> of mild steel, a {{material}} which corrodes {{at a faster}} rate than other forms of steel such as cast iron or stainless steel. Mild steel is commonly used because of its cost, ease of use, strength, and ability to take on more deformation without failing. It also corrodes more quickly in outdoor environments, especially moist atmospheres, and causes increased loss of metal due to rusting the longer it is exposed. Broken Walrus I was displayed outdoors for nearly thirty years, through cycles of harsh, midwestern winters and humid summers, causing the structure to become increasingly corroded until it was more efficient to remove the sculpture rather than repair it.|$|E

Villavan Muvendavelan, one of the top officials of Raja Raja figures in many of his inscriptions. The other names of officials found in the inscriptions are the Bana prince Narasimhavarman, a general Senapathi Krishnan Raman, the Samantha chief Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, the revenue official Irayiravan Pallavarayan and Kuruvan Ulagalandan, who organised the country-wide land surveys.|$|E

He later said about this engagement, [...] "I did it for the money. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> an offer I couldn't refuse." [...] In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games, ticket sales jumped by 77 percent. He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973–74 NBA season with a 141–209 record.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics are}} autobiographical and portray Azalea's fame-seeking {{relocation}} from Mullumbimby to Miami {{at the age}} of 16, and deal with subjects of work ethic and dedication to craft. It specifically accounts for the events of Azalea growing up in Mullumbimby, juggling multiple occupations to save an income to independently start anew in Miami. The lyrics also serve as a celebration of Azalea's progression from being a struggling rapper as a rags to riches story and an underdog anthem. The line [...] "Who don't know shit 'bout where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> / Or how many floors that I had to scrub," [...] was suggested to be directed at her [...] "haters". While the couplet, [...] "Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt, sugar cane, back lanes" [...] is eloquent for Azalea's origin.|$|E

The record produced several hit singles, including [...] "Where It's At", [...] "Devils Haircut", and [...] "The New Pollution", and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album {{as well as a}} Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for [...] "Where It's At". During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on Saturday Night Live and Howard Stern, and did a last-minute trot on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. The combined buzz gave Odelay a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure. Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of Odelay. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. [...] "It's just weird. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel natural to me. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> for that. I was never good at that," [...] he later told Pitchfork. Odelay sold two million copies and put [...] "one-hit wonder" [...] criticisms to rest. During this time, he contributed the song [...] "Deadweight" [...] to the soundtrack of the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997).|$|E

500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'.

I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E
