Automatic extraction and recognition of part features directly from a CAD database also strengthen the link between CAD and CAPP.

40|$|Lien vers la version éditeur: [URL] audienceDimensional {{errors of}} the parts from a part family cause the initial {{misplacement}} of the workpiece on the ﬁxture aﬀecting the ﬁnal product quality. Even if the part is positioned correctly, the <b>external</b> <b>machining</b> forces and clamping load cause the part to deviate from its position. This deviation depends on the external load and the ﬁxture stiﬀness. In this article, a comprehensive analytical model of a 3 - 2 - 1 ﬁxturing system is proposed, consisting of a kinematic and a mechanical part. The kinematic model relocates the initially misplaced workpiece in the machine reference through the axial advancements of six locators taking all the ﬁxturing elements to be rigid. The repositioned part then shifts again from the corrected position due to the deformation of ﬁxturing elements under clamping and machining forces. The mechanical model calculates this displacement of the part considering the locators and clamps to be elastic. The rigid cuboid baseplate, used to precisely re-locate the workpiece, is also considered elastic at the interface with the locators. Using small displacement hypothesis with zero friction at the contact points, Lagrangian formulation enables us to calculate the rigid body displacement of the workpiece, deformation of each locator, {{as well as the}} stiﬀness matrix and mechanical behavior of the ﬁxturing system. This displacement of the workpiece is then ﬁnally compensated by the advancement of the six axial locators calculated through the kinematic model...|$|E

We consider mobile phones as appropriate secure gateways to provide access to the Internet for <b>external</b> <b>machines</b> with low communication needs. A message-based approach is best in such a scenario with moving mobile phones and machines. In this paper we propose a security model for access control to the communication infrastructure, which is also message oriented. To meet the requirements of ubiquitously communicating machines, all algorithms on the sender’s side are based on symmetric cryptography resulting in low computation requirements. Our sophisticated symmetric key infrastructure for access control is based on unique combinations of keys and is completed with an effective key management. This results in a carrier grade security level although many parties share the same keys. Adopting the Subscriber Identity Module as a secure storage and computing module achieves the trustworthiness of the mobile phone.
