40|$|Purpose. Development of {{mathematical}} model for calculation of starting modes of asynchronous motor connected {{in series with}} capacitors. Method. Mathematical modeling of dynamic modes of asynchronous motors with lateral capacitor compensation of reactive power. Results. The calculation algorithm and results of mathematic modeling of processes during starting modes of asynchronous motor feeding from the network <b>through</b> <b>capacitors</b> connected in series are presented. It is shown that for some values of capacitance the self-excitation processes and subharmonic oscillations can appear. Scientific novelty. Mathematic modeling and research of processes in asynchronous motor under its <b>feeding</b> <b>through</b> <b>capacitors</b> is carried {{out for the first}} time. The calculation algorithm is based on the mathematical model of asynchronous motor with high level of adequacy, which takes into account the magnetic core saturation and the current displacement in limbs of the rotor. Practical implication. Developed mathematical model makes it possible to investigate the possibility of self-excitation modes appearing in condition of their feeding from line with lateral compensation of reactance {{in order to avoid the}} negative effects typical for them...|$|R

The ternary gates are implemented using recharge logic {{which can be}} exploited in binary and multiple-valued logic (MVL).

By combining signals <b>through</b> <b>capacitors</b> stuck on/stuck off and stuck at faults are not destructive when redundancy is applied.

40|$|DE 102009013355 A 1 UPAB: 20101002 NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has a {{base body}} (14) {{provided with a}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> (13) for an optical waveguide. The optical waveguide {{is led by the}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> in a region of ends, and includes a core (11) and a cladding (12). The optical waveguide is partly metalized in region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding. An electroplating (15) is in thermal contact with the base body. An optical reflector (16) is arranged between ends of the optical waveguide and the <b>feed</b> <b>through.</b> The optical reflector encloses the optical waveguide, and reflects scattered radiation. USE - Coupling arrangement for an optical waveguide i. e. optical fiber. ADVANTAGE - The optical waveguide is partly metalized in the region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding, and the electro plating is in the thermal contact with the base body, thus reducing cost, and achieving higher performances. The micro drilling is performed such that the electro plating is preferably located in direct contact with the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through,</b> thus providing an additional heat conducting medium between electroplating and the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> to improve the heat conducting contact...|$|R

40|$|This paper, we {{analyzed}} that the measured {{data of the}} radiated power spectrum of electromagnetic waves of the normal spark ignition system and the spark ignition system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser.

From these results, the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser can reduce the electromagnetic waves radiating from the spark ignition system which is the spurious emission, and it can be concluded that the ignition coil of the spark ignition system generating high voltage pulse is equivalent to the radio frequency oscillator which is oscillating hig...|$|R
