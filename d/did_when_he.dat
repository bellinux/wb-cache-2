5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> directed A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it seems to me. They're not so busy thinking about technique that they have actors turning into marionettes.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E

5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E
5|$|The Cyrus Cylinder bears {{striking}} {{similarities to}} older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and {{the annals of}} Sargon II of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced {{many of the same}} problems of legitimacy that Cyrus <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus, also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.|$|E
25|$|Before {{coming of}} age, {{he was known}} as Estel ("hope") to hide his true lineage from Sauron's forces, who sought the heir of Isildur.

25|$|Kelly {{tendered}} {{drawings of}} plants and flowers from the late 1940s on. Ailanthus (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) {{was the first one}} he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in Paris. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page.|$|E

25|$|When Camille {{was twelve}} his father {{sent him to}} {{boarding}} school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature {{when he returned to}} St. Thomas, which he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practise drawing during breaks and after work.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2004, as the NHL and the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a season-long lockout, Disney tried to sell the team, but {{received}} a low offer of US$40 million, less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, Broadcom co-founder Henry Samueli of Irvine, California, and his wife Susan bought the Mighty Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75 million. The Samuelis pledged to keep the team in Anaheim, unlike Arturo Moreno <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> purchased the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from Disney and decided to turn the team into a Los Angeles-based franchise (though still based in Anaheim at Angel Stadium).|$|E
25|$|Since Macpherson {{had long}} {{served as the}} coach for the Bryan brothers, it was {{inevitable}} that the twins would want to follow him just as they <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was hired as the Aviators' head coach in 2014. Consequently, prior to the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for financial consideration. The Aviators did not protect 2014 WTT Female Most Valuable Player Daniela Hantuchová in the marquee portion of the draft. Madison Keys was assigned to the Aviators as a league-designated player, and they selected her as their only marquee draft pick. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aviators protected Raven Klaasen and Květa Peschke. They did not protect 2014 WTT Male Rookie of the Year Somdev Devvarman. The Aviators selected amateur Taylor Fritz and Chanelle Scheepers in the roster portion of the draft. Fritz was the only amateur player selected in the 2015 WTT Draft.|$|E

500|$|Van Buren's profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he [...] "lined up as a halfback but played {{more like}} a fullback." [...] He had a rare {{combination}} of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. [...] "There's no trick," [...] {{he said of his}} running style. [...] "When I see I'm gonna be tackled I just put my head down and give 'em the shoulder." [...] He was described as a [...] "deadly tackler", hitting as hard on defense as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.|$|E
