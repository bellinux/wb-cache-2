40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{increase}} knowledge regarding associations between couples' health condition and psychological distress in both spouses considering gender as well as patient/spouse status. Method: We examined a community-based sample of 995 <b>elderly</b> <b>couples</b> in which either both spouses were healthy, one of them suffered from chronic disease or both spouses were ill. Both spouses filled out the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: In line with our hypotheses, the results showed an association between women's psychological distress and their own as well as their spouse's health condition, whereas men's psychological distress was associated only with their own health condition. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the need for awareness of gender and patient/spouse differences in psychological distress among <b>elderly</b> <b>couples</b> confronted with chronic disease.

Preferences and the intrahousehold bargaining process are identified by using panel data with couples and individuals who turned into widow(er) hood in the covered period. The model does not only look at the extensive margin (working versus being retired), but also at the intensive margin (how many hours are worked) and the claiming decision for social security benefits. We apply the model to American households coming from the first five waves of the Health and Retirement Study. We also provide model simulations for two widely discussed reform proposals; more specifically the abolition of the earnings test and the elimination of the spouse benefit. The model simulations reveal only small changes in labor supply of <b>elderly</b> <b>couples.</b> ...|$|R
