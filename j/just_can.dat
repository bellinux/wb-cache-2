2500|$|Advocates for {{alternative}} uses of an alkaline diet propose {{that since the}} normal pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, the goal of diet should be to mirror this by eating a diet that is alkaline producing as well. [...] These advocates propose that diets high in acid-producing elements will generally lead the body to become acidic, which can foster disease. This proposed mechanism, in which the diet can significantly change the acidity of the blood, goes against [...] "everything {{we know about the}} chemistry of the human body" [...] and has been called a [...] "myth" [...] in a statement by the American Institute for Cancer Research. [...] Unlike the pH level in the urine, a selectively alkaline diet has not been shown to elicit a sustained change in blood pH levels, nor to provide the clinical benefits claimed by its proponents. Because of the body's natural regulatory mechanisms, which do not require a special diet to work, eating an alkaline diet <b>just</b> <b>can,</b> at most, change the blood pH minimally and transiently.|$|E

It made {{me see that}} God the Father, though He be <b>just,</b> <b>can</b> justly justify the coming sinner. It made me greatly ashamed of the vileness of my former life, and confounded me with the sense of mine own ignorance; for there never came thought into my heart before now, that showed me so the beauty of Jesus Christ. It made me love a holy life, and long to do something for the honour and glory of the name of the Lord Jesus; yea, I thought that had I now a thousand gallons of blood in my body, I could spill it all for the sake of the Lord Jesus.[283] ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is apt to}} be {{supposed}} that the copula is {{something more than a}} mere sign of predication; that it also signifies existence. In the proposition, Socrates is just, it may seem to be implied not only that the quality <b>just</b> <b>can</b> be affirmed of Socrates, but moreover that Socrates is, that is to say, exists. This, however, only shows that there is an ambiguity in the word is; a word which not only performs the function of the copula in affirmations, but has also a meaning of its own, in virtue of which it may itself be made the predicate of a proposition. That the employment of it as a copula does not necessarily include the affirmation of existence, appears from such a proposition as this, A centaur is a fiction of the poets; where it can not possibly be implied that a centaur exists, since the proposition itself expressly asserts that the thing has no real existence.|$|E
