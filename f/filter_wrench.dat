5000|$|The {{rings on}} {{screw-on}} filters are often made of aluminum, though in more expensive filters brass is used. Aluminum filter rings are much lighter in weight, but can [...] "bind" [...] to the aluminum lens threads they are screwed in to, requiring {{the use of}} a <b>filter</b> <b>wrench</b> to get the filter off of the lens. Aluminum also dents or deforms more easily.|$|E
50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the <b>filter.</b> A socket <b>wrench</b> or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the hexagonal bar further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage.|$|R
