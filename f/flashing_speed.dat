60|$|Even {{while the}} {{superintendent}} was speaking Will Garvie's swift mind had appreciated the idea. He had leaped down and uncoupled the Lightning from its train. John touched the whistle, let on steam and off they went {{crossed to the}} up-line (which was the wrong line of rails for any engine to run in that direction), and away he went at forty, fifty, seventy miles an hour! John knew well that he was flying towards a passenger-train, which was running towards him at probably thirty-five or forty miles an hour. He was aware of its whereabouts at that time, for he consulted his watch and had the time-table by heart. A collision with it would involve the accumulated momentum {{of more than a}} hundred miles an hour! The time was short, but it was sufficient; he therefore urged Will to coal the furnace until it glowed with fervent heat and opened the steam valve to the uttermost. Never since John Marrot had driven it had the Lightning so nearly resembled its namesake. The pace was increased to seventy-five and eighty miles an hour. It was awful. Objects flew past with <b>flashing</b> <b>speed.</b> The clatter of the engine was deafening. A stern chase is proverbially a long one; but in this case, at such a speed, it was short. In less than fifteen minutes John came in view of the fugitive--also going at full speed, but, not being so powerful an engine and not being properly managed as to the fire, it did not go so fast; its pace might have been forty or forty-five miles an hour.|$|E
50|$|After leaving school, {{he joined}} the Glebe-Balmain Club with his brothers. At 20 he made his debut for NSW against New Zealand and made an {{immediate}} impression with his explosive running, which led to his selection in the 1927-28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada. On that tour, among a veritable firmament of rugby stars, Ford stood out for his great vision, which identified opposition weaknesses. When the Waratahs were within striking distance, canny captain Johnnie Wallace, Ford’s team-mate at Glebe-Balmain, invariably pulled Jack Ford out of the pack to play at second five-eighth. With his <b>flashing</b> <b>speed,</b> immense strength and sheer size (he {{was by far the}} biggest man in the Waratah team), he was virtually unstoppable and scored twelve tries from this tactic in twenty-four matches on tour as well as setting up many more for others to score after he had made the break.|$|E

Additionally, the camera can be set to automatically delay its shutter release to compensate for flickering electric lights. The camera's reflex mirror is driven by a motor which slows the mirror to reduce vibration during high speed shooting.

50|$|Snyder {{described}} {{coming up}} with original ways for the human Batman {{to take on the}} superhuman Justice League as difficult. He chose to focus on Batman using means to incapacitate the members instead of neutralizing them completely, to avoid hurting his closest friends outside of the members of his Bat-family. Snyder and Capullo discussed the major points of each issue before Snyder began writing the script, so that Capullo could provide input on how to convey the action scenes. In one instance he suggested conveying the <b>Flash's</b> <b>speed</b> by having him tear away a piece of Batman's armor, {{and the rest of the}} action occurring within the timespan it takes for the piece to fall to the ground.|$|R

Infantino designed the now-classic red uniform with yellow detail (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Captain Marvel), striving to keep the costume as streamlined as possible, and he drew on his design abilities to create a new visual language to depict the <b>Flash's</b> <b>speed,</b> using both vertical and horizontal motion lines to make the figure a red and yellow blur.

The system can produce light at variable <b>flash</b> <b>speeds</b> and pulse shapes or can operate as a continuous light source for long-term measurements.

5000|$|The {{camera is}} {{positioned}} {{over the shoulder}} for third-person shooting, and the player can also take cover by standing next to an object such as a pillar or wall. While in cover, Hayden can move temporarily out of cover to fire and throw the Glaive; however there is no blind firing from behind cover. There is a sprint function, which works similar to Gears of Wars Roadie Run, and simple melee attacks that allow Hayden to punch or slice nearby enemies. The game has no HUD (except for the ammo counter); Hayden's health is shown by the screen flashing red when he takes damage, {{as well as an}} indicator showing the attacker's position. If Hayden takes too much damage, the <b>flash</b> <b>speed</b> will increase, and a heartbeat will be heard, indicating Hayden is [...] "bleeding out".|$|R

There is a design flaw on this suit: it uses too much power to keep it functioning. Thus, Batman must only use it for {{a limited amount of}} time. Lucius Fox also supplies Bruce Wayne and his son Damian a pair of experimental jetsuit prototypes. They can provide artificially enhanced strength and endurance as well as short-range flight capability. The prototypes are considered too risky and expensive for operational military use, allowing the Waynes to utilize them for the family's Batman Inc. project.|$|R
