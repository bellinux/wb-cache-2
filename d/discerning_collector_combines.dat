Among the 21 pictures attributed to the Venetian master bought by Hume, only the Death of Actaeon (London, National Gallery) was actually an autograph.

40|$|General purpose garbage {{collectors}} {{have yet}} to combine short pause times with high throughput. For example, generational collectors can achieve high throughput. They have modest average pause times, but occasionally collect the whole heap and consequently incur long pauses. At the other extreme, concurrent collectors, including reference counting, attain short pause times but with significant performance penalties. This paper introduces a new hybrid <b>collector</b> that <b>combines</b> copying generational collection for the young objects and reference counting the old objects to achieve both goals. It restricts copying and reference counting to the object demographics for which they perform well. Key to our algorithm is a generalization of deferred reference counting we call Ulterior Reference Counting. Ulterior reference counting safely ignores mutations to select heap objects. We compare a generational reference counting hybrid with pure reference counting, pure marksweep, and hybrid generational mark-sweep collectors.

Some realtime collectors are scalable, while others assume a well-behaved mutator or provide no worst-case guarantees at all.

40|$|AbstractHybrid {{photovoltaic-thermal}} (PVT) collectors co-generate {{solar electricity}} and heat in a single component with an optimum utilization of space. Spectrally selective but transparent low-emissivity (low-e) coatings are a proven method to reduce thermal losses. However, overheating and stagnation are critical issues for these collectors due to material degradation, thermal stress, and low electrical efficiency. This paper presents a PVT collector concept with variable film insulation as overheating protection. An inflatable glass-film cushion regulates thermal losses. Performance and stagnation tests were carried out with a prototype. During normal operation the collector achieves a high thermal efficiency. In periods of standstill, the deflated cushion has a high heat dissipation rate by deactivating the low-e coating. Stagnation temperatures are thus limited to 95 ̊C. To conclude, the PVT <b>collector</b> <b>combines</b> the advantages of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors which are a high thermal efficiency and low stagnation temperatures...|$|R
