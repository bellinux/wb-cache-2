40|$|Dental amalgam {{is still}} the {{material}} most commonly used to restore posterior teeth in many countries. Amalgam is very popular because of its strength, longevity, low cost, and relative ease of handling compared to other direct restorative materials. Two important disadvantages of amalgam restaurations are lack of adhesion to tooth structure and marginal leakage. Introduction of dentin adhesive systems enabled better marginal seal between amalgam and tooth structure. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate, in vitro conditions, the marginal seal of amalgam restaurations with dentin adhesive systems using the method of diffusion dye. Material and methods: In this study 50 extracted human teeth were used. Class II cavities were prepared on all the teeth. The teeth were divided in five groups and materials applied according to manufacturer’s instructions: Gamabond, Optibond Solo, OptiGuard, Ionosit - Base Liner and control group. All the teeth were thermocycled 200 times, at temperatures: 5 - 7 ºC, 37 ºC and 57 - 59 ºC. Method of diffusion dye was used to estimate the quality of marginal seal of amalgam restaurations. All teeth were immersed into 50 % solution of silver nitrate, and then into 10 % developing solution. All teeth were cut with a diamond disc in the meso - distal plane. <b>Penetration</b> <b>dye</b> was estimated using binocular magnifying glass that magnifies 25 times, with inserted micrometar scale. Results were statistically analysed with Student t - test. Results: The least <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> was recorded in the group of amalgam restaurations rebonded with OptiGuard. Higher <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> was noted in the groups of adhesive amalgam restaurations, where Gamabond showed lower <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> in comparison with Optibond Solo. <b>Penetration</b> <b>dye</b> in the group Ionosit - Base Liner was higher than in the groups where dentin adhesive systems were used: on the occlusal wall, <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> in comparison with Gamabond showed statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 5) while <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> in comparison with Optibond Solo showed no statistically significant difference. On the gingival wall, <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> in comparison with dentin adhesive systems - Gamabond and Optibond Solo, showed a statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 01). The highest <b>penetration</b> <b>dye</b> was in the control group. Conclusion: The best marginal seal of amalgam restaurations was achieved with OptiGuard. Use of dentin adhesive systems also provided good marginal seal, with better results from Gamabond compared to Optibond Solo.

The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the effect of calcium hydroxide and 1 % chlorhexidine gel as intracanal medicaments on tooth apical seal. Materials and Methods: Seventy extracted, single-rooted maxillary anterior teeth were divided into the three experimental groups (n= 20). All root canals were instrumented with step-back technique and divided into three groups. Group 1 had root canal dressing with calcium hydroxide; group 2 had root canal dressing with 1 % chlorhexidine gel and group 3, did not receive a dressing. The roots were incubated in 100 % humidity at 37 °C for 7 days. After removing the dressings, all canals of the experimental groups were obturated using a cold lateral condensation technique. The root surfaces of all specimens were coated with two layers of nail varnish, except for the 2 mm surrounding the apical foramen. Apical sealing ability was assessed by dye leakage method and the specimens were examined under a stereo-microscope. <b>Dye</b> <b>penetrations</b> were measured and analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test. Results: Calcium hydroxide group had the least frequency of apical leakage at 2 mm level (0. 46 ± 0. 40 mm), whilst chlorhexidine group showed the greatest apical leakage (0. 86 ± 0. 42 mm). There was statistical difference between group 1 and 2 (P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{production}} of gelatine at Gelita N. Z. Ltd. {{is a time}} consuming process. The time limiting {{step in the process}} is the pre-treatment of the collagen tissue of the raw material in a lime/sodium sulfide solution. The liming solution breaks down the collagen in the tissue to gelatine. This is a necessary step prior to the extraction of gelatine from the hide pieces. The current liming process takes nearly 50 days to complete. Methods were investigated to increase the rate of penetration of the chemicals into the bovine hide raw material. An increase in the penetration of the liming solutions would lead to shorter processing times for this step in the process. The methods that were investigated were temperature controlled mixing, fluidization of the hide pieces and the use of ultrasound. Of all the methods tested, the fluidization of the hide pieces gave the best results. The pretreatment time of the hide pieces was reduced 9 days with this technique. Methods were also investigated to monitor the levels of conditioning in the raw material An accurate technique to measure hide conditioning was important to pilot plant trials. This helped determine how well any of the trail methods increased the penetration of chemicals into the hide pieces. The use of an ultraviolet dye proved an effective method of measuring conditioning for all the pilot plant trials. The level of chemical penetration was monitored by assessing the penetration of the UV <b>dye.</b> The <b>penetration</b> of the UV dye could be quantified by using imaging software.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Favorable apical seal of root filling {{materials}} {{is a crucial}} factor for a successful root canal treatment. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare bacterial and dye microleakage of two root canal filling materials including standard gutta-percha and nanosilver coated gutta-percha, and to evaluate the agreement between results of these two methods. MATERIALS & METHODS: Fifty-eight extracted single-rooted teeth were randomly divided into two experimental groups of 26 each, and two control groups of three each. After decoronation, root canals were instrumented by crown-down technique. Obturation was conducted using standard gutta-percha in one of experimental groups and nanosilver-coated gutta-percha in another group. AH 26 sealer {{was used as the}} sealer in both experimental groups. Bacterial leakage was investigated after 60 days using Enterococcus (E.) faecalis microbial strains, and dye leakage was assessed during 72 hours using 1 % methylene blue. The data were statistically analyzed by Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cohen’s Kappa. RESULTS: There was 84 % bacterial leakage in standard gutta-percha group and 76 % in nanosilver gutta-percha group. Complete dye leakage occurred in 24 % and 27 % of standard and nanosilver gutta-percha groups, respectively. The above difference between groups was not significant. In the samples with leakage, recorded times of leakage were not significantly different. There was no significant measure of agreement between <b>dye</b> and bacterial <b>penetration</b> along root-end fillings. CONCLUSION: There was a poor agreement between dye and bacterial leakage methods. Leakage results produced by nanosilver gutta-percha were comparable to those by standard gutta-percha.

The photocatalytic activity of Cr(2  at. %)-doped TiO 2 {{was found to}} be higher than that of the undoped TiO 2 film; this can be related to the surface morphology and to the optical and optoelectronic properties of TiO 2 doped with 2  at. % Cr. In fact, higher surface roughness (root-mean-square (RMS)) leads to an increase of the effective surface area and may then improve the photocatalytic activity; the RMS of the TiO 2 :Cr/PS structures increases from 17 to 43  nm as Cr doping varies from 0 to 4  at. %. Good photocatalytic response at an optimal concentration of 2  at. % Cr can also be explained by the increase in the minority carrier lifetime probably coming from carrier exchange with PS. This optimum could be {{explained by the fact that}} the presence of dopant prevents the recombination of exciton. Further increase in loading of Cr decreased the percentage of degradation of AB. This is due to the increased coverage of the semiconductor surface by the metal which decreases the surface adsorption sites expected to be available to the <b>dye.</b> The diminished <b>penetration</b> depth of light at higher Cr concentration could also prevent excitation of the semiconductor. In general, there are controversial results concerning the influence of Cr on the photocatalytic activity of the host material[26, 27]. It is then difficult to compare the reported results due to the variety of synthesis and experiment conditions, which in turn have substantial impacts on the material bandgap and performance photoactivity[26 – 30].|$|R

Root-end resection, preparation and obturation should provide an adequate apical seal. The aim of this in vitro {{study was to investigate}} bacterial and dye microleakage of four different root-end filling materials and compare the efficacy of these two methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six single-rooted teeth with intact and straight roots were randomly assigned into four study groups of 12 each and two control groups of three each. After decoronation, root canals were prepared up to file size # 40 using step back technique; then, they were filled with gutta-percha and AH 26 sealer. Root-ends were resected 3 mm above the root-end and 3 mm deep cavities were prepared. Root-end cavities were filled with amalgam, Root Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (Root MTA), White ProRoot MTA (WMTA), and calcium enriched mixture (CEM) cement. Bacterial leakage was investigated in Trypticase Soy Broth (containing Enterococcus faecalis) after 70 days and 1 % methylene blue dye leakage was assessed after 72 hours. Complete dye leakage was checked using stereomicroscope (× 40). Data were statistically analyzed using Fisher Exact test. For pair comparison between the two methods Kapa agreement was utilized.

Half of the plots received a pre-application of 15 cm of water; 48 h later either 15 cm or 30 cm of water with dye and bromide (KBr) tracers (each applied at 1 · 0 gl− 1) were applied to the plots in either a single pulse or in five equal volumes over a 5 -day period. Each plot was then excavated in 10 cm depth increments 48 h after the final water and tracers were applied, and nine soil samples were taken at each depth using a 3 × 3 grid for gravimetric water and bromide contents. Gravimetric water and bromide concentration profiles with depth confirmed that water penetrated more deeply in the plots with a previous root system, and photos of the dye stained soil at each 10 cm depth confirmed that a significant percentage of the cross-sectional area was not contributing to flow at the same rate. Multiple regression analysis further indicated that the deepest depth of <b>dye</b> and bromide <b>penetration,</b> and the depth at which mean gravimetric water content was above 0 · 10, included the aboveground biomass of the previous Larrea shrub as a significant factor accounting for plot-to-plot variability. These results suggest that (1) shrub root systems act to increase downward water flux in desert soils via root channel preferential flow to deeper soil depths, and (2) this effect becomes more pronounced as shrubs and plant root systems become larger...|$|R
40|$|Context: The study {{assesses the}} apical sealing ability of two obturating {{materials}} (resilon and gutta-percha) with their sealants {{by means of}} the <b>dye</b> <b>penetration</b> method using India ink. Aims: To compare the resistance to apical <b>dye</b> <b>penetration</b> between resilon (with Epiphany sealer; Epiphany®, Pentron clinical technologies, USA) and gutta-percha (with AH Plus sealer; Dentsply, Maillefer, Germany). It was hypothesized {{that there would be no}} difference between the two groups with regard to apical <b>dye</b> <b>penetration.</b> Settings and design: Hundred mandibular first premolars from individuals aged between 20 to 25 years were selected after their lengths were standardized. Materials and Methods: Instrumentation was performed with NiTi hand protaper files (Dentsply, Maillefer) using EDTA paste and copious irrigation with 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. Experimental group 1 consisted of roots that were treated with Epiphany primer and obturated with resilon (with Epiphany sealer). Experimental group 2 consisted of those obturated with gutta-percha using AH Plus sealer. The samples were immersed in blue India Ink and cleared using 5 % nitric acid. <b>Dye</b> <b>penetration</b> was assessed under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Roots obturated with resilon core material and Epiphany sealer exhibited lesser mean apical <b>dye</b> <b>penetration</b> (1. 281 mm; SD: 0. 742) in comparison to those obturated with gutta-percha and AH plus sealer (2. 154 mm; SD: 0. 814). The difference was found to be highly significant (P< 0. 0025). Conclusion: Resilon (with Epiphany sealer) provided better radicular apical sealing in comparison to gutta percha (with AH Plus sealer) ...|$|E
