Nanofluids contain suspended metallic nanoparticles, {{which increases the}} thermal conductivity of the base fluid by a substantial amount. The heat transfer coefficient of nanofluids increases with volume concentration. To determine how nanofluid heat transfer characteristics enhance as volume concentration is increased; experiments were performed on copper oxide, aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide nanofluids, each in an ethylene glycol and water mixture. Calculations were performed for conventional finned-tube heat exchangers used in buildings in cold regions. The analysis shows that using nanofluids in heat exchangers could reduce volumetric and mass flow rates, and result in an overall pumping power savings. Nanofluids necessitate smaller heating systems, which are capable of delivering {{the same amount of}} thermal energy as larger heating systems using base fluids, but are less expensive; this lowers the initial equipment cost excluding nanofluid cost.

To perform the experiments conveniently and economically, six plates with nozzles and sealing grooves are used to construct a hexahedral shell of the mini heat exchanger based on bolted connections, and the units are easily to be disassembled so that the heat transfer array can be replaced if necessary. The arrangement of micro-tubes is similar to that in the conventional micro shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The experiments are carried out under atmospheric pressure condition, so the inlet temperatures and mass flow rates for both shell-side and tube-side fluids can be adjusted. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated to evaluate the heat transfer efficiency of the array of micro-tubes, and the influences of some parameters, such as tube {{inner diameter}}, tube spacing distance, inlet temperature difference, inlet mass flow rates, etc., on the heat transfer coefficient are investigated. By comparing the heat transfer coefficient of the mini heat exchanger with that of the conventional shell-and-tube heat exchanger, it is revealed that the heat transfer enhancement is realized by using the array of micro-tubes.

In buildings Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are increasingly being used to reduce the heating and cooling peak demand. Phase Change Slurries (PCSs) are heat transfer fluids, which consist of a latent heat component, a dispersed PCM, and a sensible heat component, a carrier fluid that provides fluidity. This combination of sensible and latent heat storage offers high heat storage capacity, while circumventing the low thermal conductivity problems associated with PCMs. The fluidity of PCSs enables pumping through pipes and the spatial separation of the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> and storage tank.

Although the thermal conductivity of polymer material is generally lower than the metallic counterparts, the large specific surface area provided by the polymer hollow fibre heat exchanger (PHFHE) offers the same or even better heat transfer performance with smaller volume and lighter weight compared with the metallic shell-and-tube heat exchangers. This paper presents the construction and experimental investigations of polypropylene based polymer hollow fibre heat exchangers in the form of shell-and-tube.

With its superior properties to other types of heat exchanger, the heat exchanger composed of heat pipes is playing an important role in solving the energy question, especially in the recovery of industrial afterheat. Heat pipe is subject to the corrosion generated by vitriolic dew when it works in flue gas, and the situation is worsen when the flue-gas temperature is relatively lower. In this paper, a variety of prevention methods are discussed for minimizing sulfuric acid corrosion, and most content is concentrated on surface techniques of heat pipe. The author makes a proposal that enamel is applied in the surface of heat pipe. Based on theoretical and experimental studies, the enamel's properties of anti-corrosion, thermal stability, heat transfer, and so on are dwelled on with some valuable conclusions drawn. It can be discovered that enameled heat pipe has not only economical cost, excellent corrosion-resistant property, but also can achieve high thermal stability and create less even negligible heat transfer resistance by adopting appropriate prescription and manufacture technology. In conclusion, heat pipe with high anti-corrosion ability has promising perspective in many industrial applications, and it is also going to be put into new uses such as in heat exchanging of the scrubber. Some optimistic results are obtained in carrying out this project, and sample neameled heat pipes have been produced.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Master of Technology: Chemical Engineering, In the Faculty of Engineering, Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 Energy efficiency has become an important feature {{in the design of}} process plants due to the rising cost of energy and the more stringent environmental regulations being implemented worldwide. In South Africa as in other African countries, most of the chemical plants were built during the era of cheap energy with little emphasis placed on energy efficiency due to the abundance of cheap utility sources such as coal and crude oil. In most of these plants, there exists significant potential for substantial process heat recovery by conceptual integration of the plant’s heat exchangers. Pinch Technology (PT) has been demonstrated to be a simple and very effective technique for heat integration and process optimization. This study applies the PT approach to retrofit the heat exchangers network of the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU), of a complex petroleum refinery with the aim to reduce utilities requirement and the associated gaseous pollutants emission. This objective is accomplished by firstly conducting an energy audit of the unit to scope for potential energy saving. The existing Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) was re-designed using the remaining problem analysis (RPA) to achieve improved process energy recovery while making maximum use of the existing exchangers. The aim is to maintain the existing plant topology as much as possible. This network was later relaxed trading heat recovery with number of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> so as to optimize the capital cost. These were implemented in AspenPlus v 7. 2 environment. The cost implications of the retrofitted and evolved networks including the capital and operating costs were determined on a 5 years payback time basis. The Problem Table (PT) analysis revealed that the minimum utilities requirements are 75 MW and 55 MW for the hot and cold utilities respectively. Compared to the existing utilities requirements of 103 MW for hot utility and 83 MW for cold utility, this represent a potential savings of about 26 % and 33 % savings for the hot and cold utilities respectively. The target utilities usage in the re-designed network after applying Remaining Problem Analysis (RPA) was found to be 55 MW for the cold utility and 75 MW for hot utility. The relaxed HEN required a cold utility of 62. 5 MW and hot utility of 81 MW. From the total cost estimation, it was found that, although an energy saving of 34 % can be achieved by the re-designed network before relaxation, the capital cost, US$ 1670000 is significantly higher than for the existing network (about US$ 980000). The final relaxed network gave an energy saving of 34 % and with total cost of US$ 1100000. It was recommended from the study after cost comparisons of the four different networks (the original network, the MER network, the relaxed network and a grass-root design) that the best network for the retrofit purpose was the relaxed HEN, because there is no major shift in deviation from the topology of the original network. From the analysis it was found that a 34 % saving in energy cost could be achieved from this retrofit. The Total Annual Cost (TAC) for this network gives credence to the fact that this retrofit which applied the rules of pinch analysis can bring about real saving in energy usage...|$|E
40|$|Elkem Materials is in {{the initial}} phase of {{developing}} rice husk combustion as a business strategy. By burning rice husk under controlled conditions the ash generated is amorphous silica in nature. This amorphous silica ash {{can be used as}} a substitute for micro silica in the concrete industry. Due to a growing demand for finely divided silica in the concrete industry, combustion of rice husk is an alternative method to generate this product. Elkem Materials and SN Power are considering to join forces in a power project based on rice husk. The idea is to install 20 MW power plants in designated Asian countries. The power will be generated from a steam cycle which heat exchanges with the rice husk combustion products. More insight is needed in order to understand how a general power plant based on rice husk can be put together. Today, two companies have developed different combustion technologies that can control the strict combustion conditions required. Still, more experimental data is needed to investigate under which conditions the reactors have to operate in order to meet the strict ash quality required by Elkem Materials. This thesis has carried out an evaluation of the major components in a 20 MW power plant facility based on rice husk. A central part has been to develop a model for how the energy content in rice husk can be utilized in a combustion process for further heat utilization. Another model is developed to estimate the surface area required to transfer a certain amount of heat from the combustion products. These models can be used for different rice husk samples and for different combustion conditions. All numbers calculated are guiding values. Lack of experiments and information has influenced their order of magnitude. Several assumptions and simplifications are carried out to be able to do some general estimations. The aim is to show the tendency, and more comprehensive calculations have to be done for further development of the project. The energy utilization of rice husk has been studied for four different combustion temperatures. In addition, five different samples of rice husk are analyzed in the combustion process to see how their characterizations influence the operation of the power plant. The results are also given an economical aspect. The greatest difference between each rice husk sample is the ash content. For the samples analyzed, this varies between 14 - 22 % (mass basis). The moisture content is low for all samples, about 9 %. Compared to other biomass fuels the carbon fraction is low and the oxygen fraction is high. This results in a low calorific value, between 12 - 14 MJ/kg. Lower ash content gives higher calorific value. Rice husk has a low bulk density, about 120 kg/m 3, and enormous volumes are necessary for generation of 20 MW electricity based on this fuel. The fuel feed varies between 480 - 580 ton/day, mainly depending on the calorific value. Different combustion temperatures have minor effect on the fuel feed. To generate a constant heat rate, a little increase in the fuel feed is necessary when the combustion temperature decreases. The ash product is a source for generating profit. Fuel with lower calorific value generates more ash. The fuel price is often decided by the calorific value, and in this case cheaper fuel will increase the profit. Between the two rice husk extremities analyzed, one sample generates 70 ton of ash per day, while the other 130 ton/day. A proximate and ultimate analysis of the different rice husk samples should be done prior to the decision of where to locate the power plant. The steam cycle is defined to operate with 55 bar and 530 °C into the turbine, while the outlet values are 0, 08 bar and 42 °C. This will generate about 21 MW. 1 MW is available for own internal demands, and 20 MW can be supplied to the local electricity grid. Operating under these conditions, the steam cycle requires 63, 25 MW of heat. Approximately 83 MW of thermal effect is needed to satisfy this need. Heat losses are not included. Depending on the size of the reactor, this amount requires several reactors in parallel where the generated flue gas is conveyed into a joint heat recovery steam generation system. The flue gas temperature has been taken down to 125 °C. The limited outlet temperature is decided by the amount of sulfur in the fuel, and by the SO 3 dew point temperature. To avoid degradation of the materials in lower temperature regions, the sulfur content and the corresponding dew point temperature have to be known. The most complex component in this power plant is the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit.</b> Because the flue gas heat transfer coefficient is low, large surface areas are needed to transfer the required amount of heat. In addition, since the majority of the ash is conveyed with the flue gas into the heat exchange units, several design restrictions have to be implemented in the boiler system. Extended surface area tubes (finned tubes) can not be used because of the impure flue gas. By installing smooth tubes, the required area will be enormous. Factors that have greater influence on the required surface area are the ash emissivity, the gas side fouling factor and the flue gas velocity. Heat transfer from radiation may contribute remarkably because of the high ash content in the flue gas. The flue gas velocity has to be strictly regulated because of the flue gas composition. This affects how efficient the heat transfer might be. Further investigations should focus on how to avoid too much reduction in the velocity. By implementing appropriate cleaning techniques, the velocity can probably be kept at higher levels. The fouling factor is the last critical parameter. This interacts with the velocity and can also be reduced by cleaning systems. Bullet cleaning is a suitable cleaning technique. When the combustion temperature decreases, the total surface area of the heat exchanger tubes will increase. Going from 850 °C to 770 °C the area increases about 1000 m 2. The areas calculated are instructive numbers. However, it is a clear relation between the combustion temperature and the required surface area. The evaluations are based on single units. Integration of the reactor and the boiler will probably increase the heat transfer efficiency and reduce the tube s surface area. To perfectly control the combustion temperatures, great amounts of oxygen are necessary. Seen from an energy utilization perspective, this is not a very efficient use of energy. A lot of air is used to reduce the temperature, and the flue gas energy content is low. Due to high excess of air in the flue gas, recycling the outlet oxygen is an important supplement for increasing the combustion efficiency. Depending on the rice husk sample and on the combustion temperature, the flue gas stream is approximately 80 kg/s. Secondary emission reduction measures are necessary to separate the fly ash from the flue gas stream. A recommended solution is to implement a cyclone to separate the larger particles (80 - 90 %) in combination with bag house filters that separate the smaller once. For these quantities of flue gas streams, the magnitude of the ash collectors have to be extraordinary large. Because the ash has an economical value, investment in this technology is important. An alternative separation method could be to locate a cyclone prior to the heat recovery system. This would simplify several challenges linked to the impure flue gas entering the water-tubes. Yet, commercialized solutions for this practice are not developed. From an economic perspective the project has great potential, though all numbers depend on future pricing, supply and demand. Realistic price estimates based on today s market justify investment in this type of power plant. The sold electricity will constitute 75 % of the income, while the amorphous silica ash constitutes the other 25 %. Though this project seems beneficial, the size of the plant should be reconsidered. Due to low bulk density, the power plant has to be located close to the rice husk suppliers. Calculations show that 53 trucks are necessary to supply the power plant. In general, the rice milling industry is characterized by smaller mills, and rice husk collected from several milling plants is necessary. A perfect industrial symbiosis would be to locate the plant on site with the mill. This presumes smaller power plants, operating with the amount of rice husk generated by the mill. Experience with controlled rice husk combustion and power generation is scarce. By operating smaller power plants, further experience will be gained. This will improve the possibility for successful design of larger power plants. </p...|$|E

40|$|Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) is the {{critical}} link between the “topping ” gas and “bottoming ” steam power cycle of a combined power plant. Depending on the mass flow and property of exhaust flue gas from the gas cycle, optimum design and operation, for minimum entropy generation in a single pressure HRSG generating superheated steam is reported in this paper. It shows that an optimum pressure of steam generation exists for minimum entropy generation. The interdependence between the physical size (and hence cost) of different <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> components of HRSG with the thermodynamic optimum operation for minimum entropy generation is presented. Optimum pressure of steam generation increases with greater size of super heater, economizer and evaporator up to certain limit, beyond which the increase in optimum saturation pressure is marginal with increase in size of the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units.</b> However, increasing evaporator size and degree of superheat have the adverse effect of lesser steam generation for a given economizer and super heater for minimum entropy generation...|$|R
5000|$|R is {{expressed}} as {{the thickness of}} the material normalized to the thermal conductivity, and under uniform conditions it is the ratio of the temperature difference across an insulator and the Heat Flux Density (<b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> per <b>unit</b> time per unit area, [...] ) through it or [...] The unit thermal conductance of a material is the reciprocal of the unit thermal resistance. This can also be called the unit surface conductance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Heat {{exchangers}} used {{in modern}} automobiles {{usually have a}} highly non-uniform air velocity distribution because {{of the complexity of}} the engine compartment and underhood flow fields; hence ineffective use of the core area has been noted. To adequately predict the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> performance in typical car radiators, a generalized analytical model accounting for airflow maldistribution was developed using a finite element approach and applying appropriate <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> equations including the e–NTU (effectiveness – number of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units)</b> method with the Davenport correlation for the air-side <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient. The analytical results were verified against a set of experimental data from nine radiators tested in a wind tunnel and were found to be within + 24 and − 10 per cent of the experimental results. By applying the analytical model, several severe non-uniform velocity distributions were also studied. It was found that the loss of radiator performance caused by airflow maldistribution, compared with uniform airflow of the same total flowrate, was relatively minor except under extreme circumstances where the non-uniformity factor was larger than 0. 5. The relatively simple set of equations presented in this paper can be used independently in spreadsheets or in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, enabling a full numerical prediction of aerodynamic as well as thermodynamic performance of radiators to be conducted prior to a prototype being built...|$|R
40|$|Acquiring {{the field}} {{information}} on temperature, pressure, concentration, or velocity {{is crucial for}} the monitoring of chemical reactors, multiphase flow systems, <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units,</b> atmospheric pollutants diffusion, and underground pollutant migration. In this paper, a dimensionality reduction matrix completion (DRMC) method is proposed for the field information sensing (FIS) of objects of interest from the scattered point measurement data. An objective functional that casts the FIS task as an optimization problem is proposed. An iteration scheme is developed for solving the proposed objective functional. Numerical simulations are implemented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is found that differing from common inverse problems, numerical simulation approaches, and tomography based field measurement methods, in the proposed method the field information can be reconstructed without the knowledge on governing equations of the measurement objects, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical properties of materials, except {{the limited number of}} the measurement data. As a result, an alternative insight is introduced for the FIS problems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a new {{systematic}} design methodology {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous energy and water minimization in multiple-contaminant systems that also feature maximum re-use of water. In addition to allowing re-use of water in multiple-contaminant systems, issues about heat losses and flowrate changes inside unit operations have also been incorporated in this new design method. To implement such a design, two new design aspects are introduced; new method for “Non-isothermal Mixing ” point identification and new “Separate System ” generation. The first aspect involves “non-isothermal mixing”, which enables direct heat recovery between water streams, and therefore allows {{the reduction of the}} number of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units.</b> The other aspect is the generation of “separate system “in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-effective series of heat-exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams. The new design aspects have been illustrated with two examples...|$|R
