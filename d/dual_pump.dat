40|$|A dual 830 and 980 nm pumping {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} aiming at broadening and flattening the spectral performance of bismuth/erbium codoped multicomponent fiber (BEDF). The spectral properties of distinct Bi active centers (BACs) associated with germanium (BAC-Ge), aluminium (BAC-Al), phosphorus (BAC-P) and silicon (BAC-Si) are characterized under single pumping of 830 and 980 nm, respectively. Based on the emission slope efficiencies of BAC-Al (∼ 1100 nm) and BAC-Si (∼ 1430 nm) under single pumping of 830 and 980 nm, the <b>dual</b> <b>pumping</b> scheme with the optimal pump power ratio of 25 (980 nm VS 830 nm) {{is determined to}} achieve flat, ultrabroadband luminescence spectra covering the wavelength range 950 - 1600 nm. The <b>dual</b> <b>pumping</b> scheme is further demonstrated on the on-off gain performance of BEDF. It is found under the pump power ratio of ∼ 8 (980 VS 830 nm), The gain spectrum has been flattened and broadened over 300 nm (1300 - 1600 nm) with an average gain coefficient of ∼ 1. 5 dBm- 1. The spectral coverage is approximately 1. 5 and 3 times wider compared to single pumping of 830 and 980 nm pumping, respectively.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release: {{distribution}} is unlimited. The <b>Dual</b> Frequency <b>Pump</b> Method of acoustically determining point by point bubble cloud densities was studied {{to determine the}} practicality of using this acoustic technique to determine bubble densities in surface ship wakes. The dual frequency technique of acoustically detecting bubbles utilizes a high and low frequency sound field to insonify the target bubbles. The bubbles themselves then radiate sound at the sidebands of higher frequency. The frequency of the return sound {{is proportional to the}} bubble sizes present. The <b>Dual</b> Frequency <b>Pump</b> Method of bubble detection can differentiate and count many different sized bubbles and is, therefore, well suited for determining ship wake bubble density distributions.
