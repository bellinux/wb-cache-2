5|$|The genus Alcelaphus emerged about 4.4 {{million years}} ago in a clade whose other members were Damalops, Numidocapra, Rabaticeras, Megalotragus, Oreonagor, and Connochaetes. An {{analysis}} using phylogeographic patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of Alcelaphus in eastern Africa. Alcelaphus quickly radiated across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the <b>hirola).</b> Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 {{million years ago}} – one to the north and the other to the south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably {{as a result of the}} expanding central African rainforest belt and subsequent contraction of savannah habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke's, Swayne's, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest. The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein's and red hartebeest. These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent population—a refugium—in eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna.|$|E
25|$|The alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, <b>hirola,</b> bontebok, blesbok, {{and several}} similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex {{mixtures}} of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygarus) are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at {{the borders of}} their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the {{head from side to}} side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) is a semi-gregarious species, while the <b>hirola</b> (Beatragus hunteri) is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.|$|E
500|$|The wildebeest, or {{the genus}} Connochaetes, is {{placed under the}} family Bovidae and {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae, where its closest relatives are the hartebeest (Alcelaphus spp.), the <b>hirola</b> (Beatragus hunteri) and species in the genus Damaliscus, such as the topi, the tsessebe, the blesbok and the bontebok. The name Connochaetes was given by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812. Wildebeest were first discovered about 1700 by Dutch settlers {{on their way to}} the interior of South Africa. Due to their resemblance to wild cattle, these people called them [...] "wild ox" [...] or [...] "wildebeest". The blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of South Africa a century later, in the 1800s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hirola</b> {{is adapted}} to arid environments with annual {{rainfall}} of 300-600mm. Their habitats range from open grassland with light bush to wooded savannahs with low shrubs and scattered trees, most often on sandy soils. [...] Despite the arid environments they inhabit <b>hirola</b> appear {{to be able to}} survive independently of surface water. [...] Andanje [...] observed <b>hirola</b> drinking on only 10 occasions in 674 observations (1.5%) and all 10 observations of drinking occurred {{at the height of the}} dry season. <b>Hirola</b> do however favour short green grass [...] and in 392 of 674 observations (58%) <b>hirola</b> were grazing on growths of short green grass around waterholes. [...] This association with waterholes has led to false reports that <b>hirola</b> are dependent on surface water.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being one}} of the rarest antelopes, {{conservation}} measures for the <b>hirola</b> antelope have so far been marginal. The Arawale National Reserve was created in 1973 as a small sanctuary for the <b>hirola</b> but has been left unmaintained since the 1980s. In late 2005, four local communities in the Ijara District have, in collaboration with Terra Nuova, developed and put forward a proposal to formally establish the Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Conservancy for the in situ protection of <b>hirola.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Beatragus hunteri, the <b>hirola,</b> Hunter's {{hartebeest}} or Hunter's antelope, is a Critically Endangered antelope species {{found on}} the border between Kenya and Somalia. They were discovered in 1888 by the zoologist H.C.V. Hunter [...] It is the only extant member of the genus Beatragus. [...] The global <b>hirola</b> population is estimated at 300-500 animals, there are no <b>hirola</b> in captivity and the wild population continues to decline. [...] According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List [...] "The loss of the <b>Hirola</b> would be the first extinction of a mammalian genus on mainland Africa in modern human history." ...|$|E
5000|$|Recent genetic {{analyses}} on karyotypic and mitochondrial DNA {{support the}} theory that the <b>hirola</b> is distinct from the topi and should be placed in its own genus. [...] They also indicate that the <b>hirola</b> is in fact more closely related to Alcelaphalus than to Damaliscus.Placing the <b>hirola</b> in its own genus is further supported by behavioural observations. Neither Alcelaphalus nor Damaliscus engage in flehmen, where the male tastes the urine of the female to determine oestrus. They are the only genera of bovids to have lost this behaviour. <b>Hirola</b> still engage in flehmen although it is less obvious than in other species.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Community Conservancy (IHCC), {{was funded}} by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service and USAID-Kenya, to conduct a survey to {{estimate}} the remaining population of this species in its natural range. The survey found only three areas with significant numbers of <b>hirola</b> and it is believed that there are no large herds or significant concentrations of <b>hirola</b> remaining in their natural range.|$|E
50|$|Young <b>hirola</b> {{leave the}} nursery herd at around {{nine months of}} age and form various {{temporary}} associations. They may gather together in mixed or single sex herds of up to three individuals; sub-adult or subordinate adult males may form bachelor herds of 2-38 individuals; female sub-adults may join an adult male and; if no other <b>hirola</b> are present, young <b>hirola</b> may attach themselves to a herd of Grant’s gazelles or simply {{spend most of their}} time alone.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hirola</b> {{are often}} found in {{association}} with other species, particularly oryx, Grant’s gazelles, Burchell’s zebra and topi. They avoid Coke’s hartebeest, buffalo and elephant. [...] Whilst <b>hirola</b> avoid direct association with livestock they reportedly prefer the short grass in areas where livestock have been grazed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hirola</b> are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with young}} being born from September to November. [...] Data on age of sexual maturity and gestation period {{are not available}} for wild <b>hirola</b> however in captivity gestation was around 7.5 months (227-242 days) with one female mating at 1.4 years old and giving birth at 1.9 years. Another pair of <b>hirola</b> mated when they were 1.7 years of age. [...] In captivity {{one of the main}} causes of mortality is wounds caused by intra-hirola aggression, including aggression between females.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{with the}} aim to {{conserve}} the <b>Hirola</b> {{as part of their}} natural and cultural heritage, four local communities (Kotile, Korisa, Hara and Abaratilo), supported by the Northern Rangelands Trust, [...] developed and put forward a proposal to the government of Kenya to establish the Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Conservancy.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Hirola</b> prefers {{areas that}} are used by {{livestock}} which puts them at increased risk from diseases like tuberculosis. [...] Due to lack of protection they are also still very vulnerable to poaching and <b>hirola</b> are also threatened by predation and competition with other wild herbivores, particularly topi and Coke's hartebeest.|$|E
5000|$|Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Conservancy: Located in the Masalani Division of the Ijara District, the conservancy {{surrounds}} the eastern {{sector of the}} Tana River Primate Reserve and is managed by and represents local Somali pastoralist communities from Hara, Korissa, and Kotile. The conservancy is a core refuge for the endemic and Critically Endangered <b>hirola</b> antelope.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hirola</b> population, {{endemic to}} {{north-eastern}} Kenya, {{has been at}} the centre of the formation of the conservancy. In 1963, fears for the species’ survival prompted the Kenya Wildlife Service to attempt a precautionary translocation of about 50 <b>Hirola</b> to the Tsavo East National Park. Although well-intentioned, the translocation was strongly opposed by local communities.|$|E

50|$|A {{translocated}} {{population was}} established in Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park with translocations in 1963 and 1996 (Hofmann, 1996; Andanje & Ottichilo, 1999; Butynski,1999; East, 1999). The 1963 translocation released 30 animals and the first survey in December 1995 and concluded that {{there were at least}} 76 <b>hirola</b> present in Tsavo at the time. Eight months later a further 29 translocated <b>hirola</b> were released in to Tsavo, at least six of which were pregnant at the time (Andanje, 1997). By December 2000 the <b>hirola</b> population in Tsavo had returned to 77 individuals (Andanje, 2002) and by 2011 the population was estimated at 76 individuals (Probert, 2011; Probert et al., 2014).|$|E
5000|$|Several {{sources have}} {{recorded}} precise measurements from both captive and wild <b>hirola.</b> The following are maximum and minimum values taken from all sources: height at the shoulder: 99-125 cm, body weight: 73-118 kg, head and body length: 120-200 cm, horn length: 44-72 cm, horn spread (greatest outside width): 15-32 cm, tail length: 30-45 cm, ear length: 19 cm. It is not stated whether horn length was measured direct from base to tip or along {{the curve of}} the horn. [...] There is no data on how long <b>hirola</b> live in the wild but <b>hirola</b> in captivity have been known to live for 15 years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hirola</b> are {{primarily}} grazers but browse {{may be important}} in the dry season. [...] They favour grasses with a high leaf to stem ratio and Chloris and Digiatta species {{are believed to be}} important in their diet. [...] Kingdon [...] does not consider the ecological requirements of the <b>hirola</b> unusual and in fact considers them to be more generalist than either Connochaetes spp. or Damaliscus spp. A vet who examined the digestive tract of several <b>hirola</b> concluded that they were well adapted to eating dry region grasses and roughage. [...] They feed on the dominant grasses of the region and Kingdon (1982) believes that quantity is more important than quality in the hirola’s diet.|$|E
50|$|Nursery herds are {{relatively}} stable but bachelor herds are very unstable with a fission fusion dynamic. In the 1970s <b>hirola</b> were observed forming aggregations {{of up to}} 300 individuals {{to take advantage of}} scarce, but spatially clumped, resources during the dry season (Bunderson, 1985).Information is lacking on male territoriality and how it relates to mating success, how and when <b>hirola</b> join a herd and how new herds are established (Butynski, 2000).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>hirola</b> is a {{medium-sized}} antelope, tan to rufous-tawny in colour with slightly lighter under parts, predominantly white inner ears {{and a white}} tail which extends down to the hocks. It has very sharp, lyrate horns which lack a basal pedicle and are ridged along three quarters of their length. As <b>hirola</b> age their coat darkens towards a slate grey {{and the number of}} ridges along their horns increases. <b>Hirola</b> have large, dark sub-orbital glands used for marking their territories and give them the name [...] "four-eyed antelope". They have white spectacles around their eyes and an inverted white chevron running between the eyes. The horns, hooves, udders, nostrils, lips and ear tips are black. Males and females look similar although males are slightly larger with thicker horns and darker coats.|$|E

50|$|The {{escalating}} {{conflict in}} Somalia in the 1990s and continuous {{decrease in population}} numbers of the <b>Hirola,</b> led to a second translocation by the Kenyan Wildlife Service in 1996. A fresh opposition to the plan resulted {{in the formation of}} a number of community-based conservation groups, one of them successfully filing a case in the Kenyan High Court against any future translocation. Nevertheless, the translocations had resulted in an isolated and viable ex situ population of perhaps 120 <b>Hirola</b> antelopes in Tsavo East National Park.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{one quarter}} of the former {{district}} is covered by the Boni Forest, which is an indigenous open canopy forest and part of Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic.http://www.eoearth.org/article/Northern_Zanzibar-Inhambane_coastal_forest_mosaic A section of the forest, the Boni National Reserve, is managed by the Kenyan Wildlife Service as a protected conservation area. Other forest types are found along the Tana River on the western border of the district. The district is also pivotal in the conservation of the critically endangered <b>Hirola</b> population. A number of initiatives and conservancies have been established to that purpose, including the Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Conservancy.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the conservancy is a core refuge and {{breeding}} ground for the endemic and critically endangered <b>Hirola</b> antelope. Together with the Arawale National Reserve, the conservancy forms {{a key part of}} the Hirola's habitat.|$|E
50|$|Authorities {{agree that}} the <b>hirola</b> belongs in the {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae within the family Bovidae {{but there has been}} debate about the genus in which it should be placed. The Alcelaphinae contains hartebeest, wildebeest and topi, korrigum, bontebok, blesbok, tiang and tsessebe.|$|E
50|$|The Ishaqbini <b>Hirola</b> Conservancy is a {{community-based}} {{conservation area}} located in Garissa County, Kenya. The conservancy covers approximately 72 km2. It is located {{along the eastern}} bank of the Tana River, and borders the former Tana River Primate Reserve (1976−2007).|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} a {{critical}} refuge {{for a range of}} wildlife species including four globally threatened species: <b>hirola,</b> Grevy's zebra, East African wild dog and East African cheetah. A study commissioned by Terra Nuova in 2006 also showed signs of presence of the African bush elephant.|$|E
50|$|KWS runs {{specific}} programmes to assist Kenyan species and habitats {{that are in}} particular danger. They have forest and Wetland conservation programmes, as well as specific elephant and rhino projects to help them recover from poaching.

50|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{historic}} decline of the <b>hirola</b> are not known but is likely {{a combination of factors}} including disease (particularly rinderpest), poaching, severe drought, predation, competition for food and water from domestic livestock and habitat loss caused by bush encroachment {{as a result of the}} extirpation of elephants in the hirola's natural range.|$|E
50|$|Female <b>hirola</b> {{give birth}} alone and may remain {{separate}} from the herd {{for up to two}} months, making them vulnerable to predation.
