40|$|Abstract The Bantarkalong {{is located}} in the {{southern}} highlands of West Java. The topography of the area is limestone mountains, rivers, arable land, and it contains rocks that are useful resources for mankind. The condition of nature therefore appeals to the past human. This isevidenced by the examples of megalithic tradition sites and remains stone tools. Based on these things then this paper aims to uncover <b>ebout</b> the utilization of spaces related to the existence of human relationships with the natural environment. Next through the theory of adaptation and the paradigm of the scope of the site will be used to discuss this topic. Finally  obtained a summary that theBantarkalong ever used of  space activity takes place asit related to human adaptation.     Keywords: occupation, tool, terrace...|$|E

Cooling the root zone by distributing the cooled nutrient solution {{is one of the most}} effective methods of zone cooling. In this experiment, ground environment with a relatively low temperature has been used to reduce the temperature of nutrient solution by placing trio nulriont solution tank in <b>ebout</b> 7 m depth under the ground (surface) It has been shown that tne method was efficient in energy use, because It need only energy for pumping the water from the depth to the floor level through a vertical pipe. Temperature of nutrient solution flowing out from the emitter with the tank placed under the ground (surface) could be maintained 0. 1 to 1. 9 °C lower than that sourced from tank placed at floor level. A heat transfer model has been developed to prodict the nutrient solution temperature flowing out from the vertical pipe. It has been shown that the predicted temperature of nutrient solution agreed well with that of the measured temperatures...|$|E
