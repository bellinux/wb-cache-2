50|$|Tandem {{running is}} a form of {{recruitment}} and communication that involves teaching and social learning. Experience influences the tendency to engage <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> running more than age. Temnothorax albipennis of all ages are able to participate <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> running, but experienced individuals are more likely to do so. Older experienced ants {{are also more likely to}} lead slowly and be precise. Young inexperienced ants are capable of leading and following <b>in</b> <b>tandem</b> runs, but they lead faster and are less accurate.|$|R

The <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> SmA phase occurs among the smectic layers (one-dimensionally), while <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> HexB phase occurs inside the layers (two-dimensionally). The <b>hopping</b> dynamics <b>in</b> SmA and HexB liquid crystal phases is investigated by parallel soft-core spherocylinders, while three-dimensional <b>hopping</b> dynamics <b>in</b> inherent glassy states is investigated by systems of Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) spheres. The temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients of <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> SmA phase can be described by the Arrhenius equation characteristic of activation process. In HexB LC phase, the diffusion coefficients saturate at higher temperatures. In a system of WCA spheres, the values and temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients depend on the observed states...|$|R
