40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{understand}} how today's students view choir. If teachers are aware of the misconceptions students have toward choir, then they can adjust their choral programs accordingly. This analysis concentrates on the different reasons students do not join choir. It uses student responses and a pre-existing survey as background material. Trends that have been found will be discussed and used to develop my hypothesis. Since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>student</b> teaching at Center Grove High School, I decided to use my own students in the questionnaire. Their responses were encouraging.

40|$|This unit {{begins with}} a {{compilation}} of researched information dealing with Congress. This information is formatted into a language easily understood by high school students. Such topics covered in this unit are the election of representatives to Congress, the organization of Congress, the duties of a legislator, and {{the process by which}} legislation is enacted. The information is followed by several enrichment activities. Some of these activities are designed to help the students develop a better understanding of Congress and the before mentioned topics, while other activities require the students to employ higher level thinking skills to this basic information. Some of these activities include writing a bill and enacting a mock Senate {{to see whether or not}} the bill becomes a law, and writing an actual letter of concern to a local Congressman. I have included some actual samples of student work in this area. These enrichment activities vary greatly in their degrees of difficulty. While this makes the unit more practical for future use, it also serves its purpose presently. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>student</b> teaching this Spring semester of 1995 in a high school government class. I employed portions of this unit in one general class and one remedial class. This is the source of my student work. My supervising teacher reported this area of study as a problem area for her remedial classes in the past. Therefore, I feel as if this unit was very beneficial for the students. I have evaluated my success with this remedial class, in particular, by discussing the effects of the use of my developed unit with my supervising teacher. She thought that the content was presented most definitely in a very thorough, yet creative way. I have also noticed the positive results of this unit when evaluating a pre-test and a post-test that I administered to the students. There were definite areas of improvement. Overall, I enjoyed developing this unit. However, I enjoyed teaching this unit even more. These remedial students really need the type of "hands-on" activities provided for in this unit. I am very happy that I could provide such a wide array of activities for these students in a most important subject that I believe is sometimes neglected. Honors CollegeThesis (B. A. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project began}} {{my senior year}} of high school when my {{favorite}} AP English teacher told me that he didn’t like poetry. I left his class confident in my prose-writing and analytical skills, intent on majoring in English at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In my freshman-year creative writing class, I read radical poetry—the poetry of Jack Spicer, George Oppen, Sylvia Plath, Amiri Baraka—that confused, fascinated, and ultimately inspired me to apply to the creative writing program. I also decided, around this time, to become a high school English teacher. This project took form as I struggled to find a place within my education classes and practicum for the exciting poetry and student-based lessons that I was experiencing in my poetry workshops. I found myself repeatedly confronting, within the world of secondary English Language Arts education, the apprehension that my high school teacher expressed about teaching poetry. I began this project with the intent of identifying and exploring the importance of including poetry in the high school English Language Arts curriculum. I wanted to design a unit that would serve as a resource to wary teachers—I wanted to give them something that would make poetry less “scary,” more comfortable. I began my research by reading all that I could find—everything from lesson plans, to pedagogical theory, to the Common Core State Standards—about how and why to teach poetry in high schools. My research shifted to practical observation and experience as I began spending time observing and teaching in schools throughout Boulder Valley. This fall, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>student</b> teaching at East High School in Denver, Colorado. I am working with both a general English Language Arts and a creative writing teacher. I am in the classroom, as a teacher and observer, full time, five days a week, for the duration of the semester.    This project is a culmination of my theoretical reading, hypothetical planning, and practical experience. As I moved through the various stages of thinking, planning and teaching, my focus moved from making poetry less “scary” to exploring such apprehension and nervousness. My central question changed from “How can I prove that poetry is necessary, safe and approachable?” to “How can I prove that poetry is necessary because it is not safe, but ambiguous and challenging?” My project is composed of two parts: first, an essay that explores key debates and fundamental practices within poetry pedagogy; and second, a six week poetry unit plan. I do not intend to prescribe—through my suggested methodology and plans—a single, simple way of teaching poetry. Instead, this project is my effort to embody in my planning and teaching the vulnerable, creative, and critical processes with which I expect my students to engage in my classroom. My hope is that this project can serve as a resource for other teachers looking for new ways of understanding poetry, teaching, and the greater purposes of education...|$|E

40|$|The {{background}} of the study in this research {{is based on the}} problems as follow: 1) The phenomena that <b>students</b> <b>are</b> not confident in speaking English in their class especially when they speak in front of audience, 2) The low self confidence causes low speaking score and ability in English speaking. The problems of this research can be stated as follows: 1) How is students’ self confidence in speaking before the implementation of Socioaffective strategies?, 2) How is the implementation of Socioaffective strategies in improving student’s self confidence in speaking?, 3) How is students’ self confidence in speaking after the implementation of Socioaffective strategies?, 4) How is the improvement of students’ self confidence in speaking before and after the implementation of Socioaffective strategies? The objectives of this study are: 1) To find out students’ self confidence in speaking before the implementation of Socioaffective strategies, 2) To know how is the implementation of Socioaffective strategies in improving students’ self confidence in speaking, 3) To describe students’ self confidence in speaking after the implementation of Socioaffective strategies, 4) To analyze the improvement of students’ self confidence in speaking before and after the implementation of Socioaffective strategies. The implementation of Sociaffetive strategies in teaching speaking at SMP Pondok Modern Selamat Kendal is Classroom Action Research Which is aimed at improving student’s self confidence in speaking. This research was conducted in two cycles. The study was conducted at SMP Pondok Modern Selamat Kendal in the academic year of 2009 - 2010.
