40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{analysis}} the system which contains time-delay elements including closed loop system and uncertainty. Time-delay will happen during the long distance communication. Therefore, {{when we have a}} control object in a long distance, the transmitted reference signal will be delayed certainly. For this reason even though we assume the control object system is a stable, but it will be an unstable system due to existence of time-delay elements. So, we consider the <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Controller <b>method</b> {{which is one of the}} robust controllers. <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Controller <b>method</b> is composed of optimum controller and uncertainty model of control object and time-delay elements.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we compare the {{official}} Basel III method for computing credit value adjustment (CVA) against {{a model that}} assumes piecewise constant default intensities {{for a number of}} both market and fictive scenarios. CVA is defined as the price deducted from the risk-free value of a bilateral derivative to adjust for the counterparty credit risk. Default intensity is defined as the rate of a probability of default, conditional on no earlier default. In the piecewise constant model, the default intensity is calibrated against observed market quotes of credit default swaps using the bootstrapping method. We compute CVA for an interest rate swap in a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross framework, where we calculate the expected exposure using the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> <b>method</b> and assume that no wrong-way risk exists.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to give an overview of creditvaluation adjustment (CVA) and adjacent concepts. Firstly, the historicalevents that preceded the initiative to reform the Basel regulations and tointroduce CVA as a core component of counterparty credit risk are illustrated. After some conceptual background material, a journey is taken through theregulatory aspects of CVA. The three most commonly used methods for calculatingthe regulatory CVA capital charge are explained in detail and potentialchallenges with the methods are addressed. Further, the document analyses ingreater depth two of the methods; the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> <b>method</b> (IMM) and thecurrent exposure method (CEM). The differences between these two methods areexplained mathematically and analysed. This comparison is supported bysimulations of portfolios containing interest rate swap contracts with differenttime to maturity and of counterparties with varying credit ratings.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{market risk}} calculation for an equity-based trading portfolio. Instead {{of relying on}} the purely stochastic <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> <b>method,</b> which banks currently apply {{in line with the}} Basel regulatory requirements, we propose to include also alternative price mechanisms from the financial literature into the regulatory framework. For this purpose {{a modified version of the}} model by Lux and Marchesi (2000) is developed, capturing the realistic feature that parts of the investors do not follow the assumption of no arbitrage, but are motivated by rules of thumb and market psychology instead. Although both the standard stochastic as well as the behavioral model are restricted to 250 trading days, the latter is able to capitalize possible turbulences on financial markets and likewise the well-known phenomenon of excess volatility - even if the last 250 days reflect a calm market for which the efficient-market hypothesis could hold. Thus it is argued that a value-at-risk-based maximum approach in the regulatory framework would create better capital requirements with respect to their level and counter-cyclicality. This in turn could reduce the extent to which (irrational) bubbles arise since market participants would have to anticipate comprehensively the costs of such bubbles bursting. Furthermore a key ratio is deduced from the agent-based construction to lower the influence of speculative derivatives...|$|E

In making this process, the Air Flow Pressure Temperature (AFPT) pilot plant is use as the case study. The AFPT pilot plant is a process control training system (PCTS) that uses only air to simulate gas, vapor or steam. This AFPT pilot plant is a scale-down Real Industrial Process Plant built on 5 ft X 10 ft steel platform, complete with its own dedicated control panel. The AFPT pilot plant can be use to control the gas density by manipulating the pressure, flow, and temperature of the plant. This AFPT pilot plant then will be simulating using Aspen Plus to develop a gas density control model. The model will be run in steady-state and dynamic mode. In dynamic mode, the controller for all the parameters to control the gas density is putted. This entire controller then will be tune using the <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control (IMC) <b>method</b> {{in order to get}} its best performance. After the simulation is done, the gas density data generated from the simulation will be compared with the actual (experiment) data for validation of the data. The data shows that the error between the two data is less than 5 %, meaning that the data generated from the simulation is valid. Then, this data will be use to develop a process estimator model using Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. After the estimation model is done, the mean squares error (MSE) between the estimated data and actual data is 0. 001584743.

An <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> based <b>method</b> {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the structural displacements under ambient excitation using only acceleration measurements. Strain measurements are incorporated to expand the method to single span concrete bridges subjected to moving vehicle loads. The structural response is assumed to remain the linear range {{for the duration of}} the loading. The excitation is assumed to be with zero mean and relatively broad bandwidth such that at least one of the fundamental modes of the structure is excited and dominates in the response. Using the structural modal parameters and partial knowledge of the load, their respective <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> can be established. These <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> can then be used to form an autonomous state-space representation of the system. It is shown that structural displacements, velocities, and accelerations are the states of such a system, and it is fully observable when the measured output contains structural accelerations only. Reliable estimates of structural displacements are obtained using the standard Kalman filtering technique. These displacement estimates can be used to determine the moment demand and provide insight into whether this demand is exceeding the capacity of the bridge. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method has been demonstrated and evaluated via numerical simulations of an eight-story lumped mass model along with a simply supported single span concrete bridge subjected to a moving traffic load. Experimental data of a three-story frame excited by ground accelerations from an actual earthquake record is also used.
