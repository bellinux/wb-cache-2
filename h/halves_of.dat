5|$|In a {{national}} sales ranking of bishōjo games in PCNEWS, a now-defunct Japanese online magazine, School Days premiered {{as the number}} one game sold {{for the second half}} of April 2005, the second and seventeenth for the first and second <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> May, the fifth and twenty-sixth for the first and second <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> June, and twenty-seventh {{for the first half of}} July. The School Days renewal edition, released a week after the previous ranking, continued to chart on behalf of the game; it ranked as the thirty-third most sold game for the second half of July, before ending as the thirty-fifth and forty-ninth for the first and second <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> August.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a heterodimer), or may have originally been <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a {{particular}} protein having evolved by a fission and fusion mechanism can be provided by observing the <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the permutation as independent polypeptides in related species, or by demonstrating experimentally that the two halves can function as separate polypeptides.|$|E

5|$|Michigan won the 1901 game, 21–0, at Ohio Field in Columbus, Ohio, {{in front}} of a crowd of {{approximately}} 4,000 persons. A special train carried 375 Michigan students to the game on the Ann Arbor and Hocking Valley railroads. Ohio State held the Wolverines to their lowest point total of the 1901 season. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost insisting on regulation <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> 30 minute and Ohio State's John B. Eckstorm insisting that the first half be limited to 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a forfeiture, coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> 30 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone {{arch bridge}} that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, {{connecting}} the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It {{was designed by}} James Paine and Kenton Couse.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann was a {{founding}} figure in computing. Donald Knuth cites von Neumann as the inventor, in 1945, of the merge sort algorithm, {{in which the}} first and second <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs {{rather than}} serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not profitable.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E

5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|In the 1919–20 season, the NHL {{reactivated}} the Quebec Bulldogs NHA franchise; {{with this}} addition, the NHL played with four teams again. There were no playoffs, as Ottawa won both <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the schedule, the undisputed NHL championship and the O'Brien Cup. Clint Benedict again led league in goalkeeper goals-against average and Frank Nighbor came {{third in the}} league scoring race with 25 goals in 23 games.|$|E
5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The pitch is far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American ice hockey rink. The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> 45 minutes each, matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} {{contains}} the Lord Warden's private apartments {{in the west}} bastion and the western half of the keep. In the southern bastion is the Duke of Wellington's Room and the Lucas Room, originally part of an apartment of rooms selected by William Pitt for his use, as they formed the warmest part of the castle. The corridor running across the castle through the keep was built by Pitt to link {{the north and south}} <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the castle.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E

5|$|Both <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> {{the road}} trace their origins {{to the early}} days of Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the island.|$|E
2500|$|In photography, stops {{are also}} a unit used to {{quantify}} ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of one-half. The one-stop unit {{is also known as}} the EV (exposure value) unit. On a camera, the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as f-stops. Each [...] "stop" [...] is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a <b>halving</b> <b>of</b> the light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of 1/ or about 0.7071, and hence a <b>halving</b> <b>of</b> the area of the pupil.|$|R
