5000|$|<b>Follow</b> <b>shot</b> or {{tracking}} shot {{is a specific}} camera angle in which the subject being filmed is seemingly pursued by the camera, for example by a Steadicam. The <b>follow</b> <b>shot</b> can be achieved through tracking devices, panning, {{the use of a}} crane, and zoom lenses resulting in different qualitative images but, nevertheless, recording a subject (performer) in motion.|$|E
40|$|AbstractParameter values {{characterizing the}} motion of the cue during impact in pool billiards have been {{determined}} for selected shots. 20 elite players performed 18 predefined tasks comprising follow, draw, stop shots and breaks. 3 D-kinematics were obtained using a motion analysis system comprising 8 cameras operating at 250 Hz and a high speed camera capturing with 5000 Hz. Longitudinal accelerations of the cue stick were recorded with 5 kHz using an accelerometer, mounted on the butt cap of the cue. Coefficients of variation for the parameter values obtained range from 3. 9 % (height of impact point of maximum <b>follow</b> <b>shot)</b> to 58. 3 % (elevation angle of 10 -ball break). The average cue stick motion is basically non-accelerated (- 0. 060 +/- 0. 508 ms- 2) at ball impact for all of the tasks except for the breaks (3. 918 +/- 0. 164 ms- 2). Despite the high number of DOF in the input configuration the tested pool billiard players achieved very similar outcomes...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{actually}} believe my {{work with the}} Akeley {{was the father of}} all dolly shots, for until I made <b>follow</b> <b>shots</b> with that camera, our cameras never moved. With the introduction of camera movement, cameramen had the opportunity of improving their art. Mobility of the camera has done much for cinematography".|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{shooters}} {{were also}} effective against heavy tanks with reactive armour: The first shot would {{be against the}} driver's viewing prisms. <b>Following</b> <b>shots</b> would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank's armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret.|$|R

50|$|<b>Follow</b> <b>shots</b> are {{typically}} used in film to establish audience alignment with {{the perspective of}} the character being followed and to follow them. The audience is made aware of the character's presence and is able to observe them in action, while also being forced to identify with the character. It is considered neither first-person perspective nor third-person perspective.|$|R

60|$|Yells and shrieks <b>followed</b> each <b>shot</b> {{through the}} door, and after {{three or four}} minutes the troopers drew off.|$|R
50|$|I Will <b>Follow</b> was <b>shot</b> in 15 days on {{location}} in Topanga Canyon, California. It is the first film to use footage from the first inauguration of Barack Obama.|$|R
50|$|During filming, the director, David Elliot, did {{not always}} <b>follow</b> certain <b>shots</b> that Fennell had written into the script. Where many scenes had {{complicated}} tracking shots, Elliot simplified them with establishing shots.|$|R
5000|$|This design reduces muzzle jump by 60%, {{due to the}} {{transition}} in material, which is unique to the 2011®. Less muzzle jump means less recoil, more control and faster <b>follow</b> up <b>shots.</b>|$|R
60|$|They listened, {{and from}} a {{distance}} heard two gun <b>shots,</b> <b>followed</b> by several more.|$|R
60|$|A dozen <b>shots</b> <b>followed</b> them. The {{men were}} {{protected}} by the coach, but Yuba Bill groaned.|$|R
50|$|<b>Following</b> the <b>shots</b> fired, two Quebec Security guards took Marois {{away from}} centre stage to the {{immediate}} hallway, and away from television cameras. A few minutes later, Marois returned to calm down the crowd {{and ask them to}} leave quietly.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>shot</b> <b>followed</b> {{by another}} and a third, with ten seconds between them, will mean 'Enemy {{seen on the}} right'; with twenty seconds between, 'Enemy seen on the left'; then, after a pause, two shots in quick {{succession}} will mean 'Enemy in strength'; three shots will be 'Small party only'; one <b>shot,</b> <b>followed</b> at an interval of ten seconds by two in succession, will mean 'Retire to the point agreed on before we separated'; <b>followed</b> by three <b>shots</b> in quick succession, will be 'Close in to the centre'. We can think of others afterwards, but I think that will do to begin with. I {{know that you have}} all pocketbooks, so take down these signals at once." ...|$|R
50|$|Semi-auto: This is {{a single}} barreled gun that {{chambers}} a new shell from a magazine automatically after each shot, but which requires the shooter to press the trigger for each shot. This design combines reduced recoil and relatively low weight with quick <b>follow</b> up <b>shots.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{boys were}} not yet dressed, when they heard a clatter of hoofs and a <b>shot,</b> <b>followed</b> by another.|$|R
60|$|No <b>shot</b> <b>followed</b> the action, {{and he went}} {{round the}} hut, and {{repeated}} the experiment at each of them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} a distant <b>shot,</b> <b>followed</b> {{immediately}} by several more. Then a rattle of musketry followed--nearer at hand.|$|R
60|$|Raising {{his rifle}} he opened fire upon the white foe. A struggling, {{rustling}} sound <b>followed</b> the <b>shots.</b> But {{whether it was}} the threshing about of wolves dying in agony, or the fighting of the fortunate ones over those shot, could not be ascertained in the confusion.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a work {{of fiction}} may {{deliberately}} employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the Marx Brothers' classic film Duck Soup, at the climax of the film, the camera shows a shot of Groucho Marx speaking a line, <b>followed</b> by a <b>shot</b> of something else happening, <b>followed</b> by another <b>shot</b> of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a Napoleonic hat, a Prussian hat, etc.).|$|R
60|$|I {{set about}} re-charging my rifle without giving heed to the rush {{which should have}} <b>followed</b> the <b>shot,</b> and dimly, {{as if it was}} {{something}} in which I had no concern, I heard the report of another rifle; another cry which seemed but the echo of my own.|$|R
50|$|Big D and the Kids Table {{was founded}} in 1995 when members converged at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Despite a {{frequently}} revolving lineup, the band built up a large local following almost immediately, packing clubs, halls, dorms, and basements in and around Boston. The band formed their own label, Fork in Hand Records, to put out their first album, Shot By Lammi, a split with Boston punk band Drexel, a side project of several Big D members (under assumed names). Soon, their label was releasing albums by a stable of Boston-area bands, building a vibrant punk/ska scene around them. <b>Following</b> <b>Shot</b> By Lammi, the band released a Live EP. Early on, they also began their tradition of holding an annual Halloween concert at home in Boston.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{they were}} conscious of some commotion {{in the direction}} of the villa, <b>followed</b> by a <b>shot</b> and then a cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would have}} taken my life," [...] said Jonathan, [...] "but in the {{struggle}} that <b>followed</b> he <b>shot</b> himself accidentally with his own pistol, and died at my very feet. I {{do not know what}} would have happened to me if a sea captain had not come and proffered his assistance." ...|$|R
60|$|The noise on deck continued, {{followed}} by {{quarter of an}} hour of silence. Then came a <b>shot,</b> <b>followed</b> by a second and a third.|$|R
5000|$|Zakuski (plural from Russian: закуски {{singular}} zakuska from закуска) is a Slavic {{term for}} {{hot and cold}} hors d'oeuvres, entrées and snacks, [...] either as a course as it is or [...] "intended to <b>follow</b> each <b>shot</b> of vodka or another alcoholic drink." [...] The word literally means something to bite after.|$|R
6000|$|... "Load away now, {{and take}} thy revenge, my fine fellow," [...] said Samoa to himself. But not yet. Seeing all at his mercy, and having none, he quickly laid his fore-topsail to the mast; [...] "hove to" [...] the brigantine; {{and opened fire}} anew upon the boat; every swell of the sea heaving it nearer and nearer. Vain all efforts to escape. The wounded man paddled wildly with his hands the dead one rolled from side to side; and the Cholo, seizing the solitary oar, in his frenzied heedlessness, spun the boat round and round; while all the while <b>shot</b> <b>followed</b> <b>shot,</b> Samoa firing as fast as Annatoo could load. At length both Cholo and savage fell dead upon their comrades, canting the boat over sideways, till well nigh awash; in which manner she drifted off.|$|R
25|$|Garda McCabe {{fired his}} Uzi at Carthy once, then again, both {{striking}} Carthy in the torso. <b>Following</b> the fourth <b>shot,</b> Carthy collapsed onto his side.|$|R
60|$|Several other <b>shots</b> <b>followed,</b> {{but they}} could not tell if anybody was hit. In the {{distance}} several rum-crazed sailors were yelling like so many Indians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold the cabin! We are coming!" [...] came in Mr. Radbury's {{well-known}} voice, {{and never}} had it sounded more comforting to the two boys than at that moment. Then <b>followed</b> more <b>shots,</b> some striking the cabin and others hitting the Indians, who were so demoralised that for the moment they knew not what to do.|$|R
60|$|In sheer desperation {{the outlaw}} leader fired {{his gun at}} the black wall whence the cry came. Then he had to fight his horse {{to keep him from}} {{plunging}} away. <b>Following</b> the <b>shot</b> was an interval of silence; the horses became tractable; the men gathered closer to the fire, with the halters still held firmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had fancied {{you knew}} all about it by this time, and felt a little {{astonished}} that you didn't come over, but I see I was mistaken. I tried {{to get hold of}} Devine's papers, as I promised you, and came upon another man attempting the same thing. During the difference of opinion that <b>followed</b> he <b>shot</b> me." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{reaction}} {{shot of the}} cook in the kitchen (<b>followed</b> by a <b>shot</b> from Huo Yuanjia's shrine) after Uncle Nong dispatches students to search for Huo Ting'en.|$|R
6000|$|... "Send a boat on board, or I'll sink you," [...] again came roaring {{from the}} stranger, <b>followed</b> by another <b>shot,</b> {{striking}} the water still nearer the cutter.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the rapid}} beat of hard hoofs {{on the trail}} was <b>followed</b> by several <b>shots</b> from the hillside. Soon the clatter of hoofs died away in the distance.|$|R
