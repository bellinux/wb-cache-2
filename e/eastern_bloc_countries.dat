5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries,</b> where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} was White British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries</b> in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to {{the second-highest}} number of {{international}} migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12million of all 244million migrants.

5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries</b> became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries</b> and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries.</b> Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{severing}} {{of relations}} after the Six-Day War, Poland {{was the first}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc</b> <b>country</b> to again recognize Israel in 1986.

50|$|Implosion is {{a science}} fiction novel by D. F. Jones, {{published}} in 1967, set in a United Kingdom just attacked by an unnamed minor <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>country.</b> The weapon used, 'Prolix', is a chemical sterilant, that, once ingested, renders most women sterile.|$|R
50|$|Romania's {{foreign policy}} was aligned with all nations that were {{aligned with the}} Soviet Union. Under Ceausescu, it enjoyed {{strategic}} relations with the Western Bloc and the Non-Aligned Movement {{and it was the}} only <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>country</b> not to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.|$|R
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries</b> to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Cold War, Australian defence {{planning}} assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc</b> <b>countries</b> it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected to operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and RAN.|$|E
5|$|Mother India {{was dubbed}} in several European {{languages}} including Spanish, French and Russian; it did substantial business in Greece, Spain and Russia {{and was released}} in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries.</b> Technicolor arranged one screening of the film in Paris on 30 June 1958, under the name Les bracelets d'or ("The Gold Bracelets"). It did minimal business in Paris, but fared better in French colonies. It was successful in the Latin American countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Mother India was also acclaimed across the Arab world, in the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and North Africa and continued to be shown {{in countries such as}} Algeria at least ten years after its release. It was released in the US on 9 July 1959 to lukewarm response, and the UK release in 1961 was also a commercial failure. The initial international version with English subtitles was 40 minutes shorter than the Indian release.|$|E
25|$|Ceaușescu's Romania was {{the only}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>country</b> that {{retained}} diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's pre-emptive strike against Egypt {{at the start of}} the Six-Day War in 1967. Ceaușescu made efforts to act as a mediator between the PLO and Israel.|$|R

5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>countries</b> during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 20–21 August 1968, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> armies from five Warsaw Pact {{countries}} – the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria — invaded Czechoslovakia. [...] The invasion comported with the Brezhnev Doctrine, a policy of compelling <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> states to subordinate national interests {{to those of the}} Bloc as a whole and the exercise of a Soviet right to intervene if an <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>country</b> appeared to shift towards capitalism. The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechoslovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000.|$|R

50|$|PRB had {{an average}} GDP per capita for an <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> <b>country.</b> Average {{purchasing}} power {{was one of the}} lowest in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> mostly due to the larger availability of commodities than in other socialist countries. Workers employed abroad often received higher payments, thus could afford a wider range of goods to purchase. According to official figures, in 1988 100 out of 100 households had a television set, 95 out of 100 had a radio, 96 out of 100 had a refrigerator and 40 out of 100 had an automobile.|$|R
