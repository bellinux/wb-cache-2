50|$|In the 1960s, {{wind chill}} {{began to be}} {{reported}} as a wind chill <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> (WCET), which is theoretically less useful. The author of this change is unknown, {{but it was not}} Siple or Passel as is generally believed. At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind. This led to equivalent temperatures that exaggerated the severity of the weather. Charles Eagan realized that people are rarely still and that even when it was calm, there was some air movement. He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of 1.8 m/s, which was about as low a wind speed as a cup anemometer could measure. This led to more realistic (warmer-sounding) values of <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The most {{accurate}} method of evaluating how {{the environment is}} affecting the thermal manikin is by calculating the <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> of the environment, accounting {{for the effects of}} radiant heat, air temperature, and air movement. It is necessary to calibrate the manikin based on this before each experiment, as the factor to convert power output and manikin skin temperature to <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> (the heat transfer coefficient) changes slightly for each zone of the manikin and based on clothing the manikin is wearing. Calibration should be carried out in a thermally controlled chamber, where radiant and air temperatures are nearly identical, and minimal temperature variation occurs throughout the space. It is necessary that the manikin be wearing the same clothing as it will during experimental tests. Multiple calibration points must be taken, minimally spanning the range of temperatures that will be tested in the experiment. During calibration air movement should be kept as low as possible, and as much of the manikin’s surface should be exposed to air and radiant heat as possible, by placing it on supports that keep it in a seated position but do not block the back or legs as a traditional seat would. Manikin data should be recorded for each calibration point when the air, surface, and manikin temperatures have all reached steady state. Temperature of the “seat” should also be recorded, and data collection should not be stopped before the seat has reached a steady state temperature. To calculate the heat transfer coefficient (hcali) the following equation is used: Qsi = the dry heat loss, or power, recorded by the manikintski = the skin temperature of the manikin teq = the <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperature</b> of the room (the calibration temperature) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. OH-equivalent {{temperatures}} {{were derived}} {{from all of the}} temperature profiles retrieved in 2004 and 2005 by the ACE-FTS instrument in a 5 degree band of latitude cen-tred on a ground-based observing station at Maynooth. A globally averaged OH volume emission rate (VER) profile obtained from WINDII data was employed as a weighting function to compute the <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The annual cycle of temperature thus produced was compared with the annual cycle of temperatures recorded at the ground-based station more than a decade earlier from the OH*(3 - 1) Meinel band. Both data sets showed excellent agreement in the ab-solute value of the temperature minimum (∼ 162 K) and in its time of occurrence in the annual cycle at summer solstice. Away from mid-summer, however, the temperatures diverged and reach a maximum disagreement of more than 20 K in mid-winter. Comparison of the Maynooth ground-based data with the corresponding results from two nearby stations in the same time-period indicated that the Maynooth data are consistent with other ground stations. The temperature dif-ference between the satellite and ground-based datasets in winter was reduced to 14 – 15 K by lowering the peak alti-tude of the weighting function to 84 km. An unrealistically low peak altitude would be required, however, to bring tem-peratures derived from the satellite into agreement with the ground-based data. OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures</b> derived from the SABER in-strument using the same weighting function produced re-sults that agreed well with ACE-FTS. When the OH 1. 6 µm VER profile measured by SABER was used as the weighting function, the OH <b>equivalent</b> <b>temperatures</b> increased in win-ter as expected but the summer temperatures were reduced resulting in an approximately constant offset of 8. 6 ± 0. 8...|$|R
