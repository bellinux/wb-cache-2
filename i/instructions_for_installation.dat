The main target is the development of graphical interface that allows the users to exploit the computation without resort to a direct use of the underlying numerical scheme. The first part briefly introduces the physical framework and presents a finite volume kinetic scheme to compute approximate solutions to the Saint-Venant system with a geometrical source term, which satisfies some fundamental properties (positivity of the water height, preservation of the steady states, entropy inequality). The parameters of the experimental setting are given, as derived from experimental studies realized at the Institut de Mécanique des Fluides in Toulouse, France.

40|$|A 7 -year-old boy {{travelling}} in {{the rear}} seat of a sedan car was wearing a lap-shoulder seat belt and sitting on a booster seat. Following a collision the boy 'submarined' under the seat belt sustaining trauma to the anterior aspect of his neck, cardiac arrest and subsequent death from hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. This case demonstrates a potential problem with unsecured older-style booster seats. Movement of a seat in a collision may cause a child to slip under a seat belt and sustain significant neck injuries. Seatbelts for children must be correctly fitted, booster seats or capsules must be securely fastened and manufacturer's recommendations for size and weight limits should be followed. Unfortunately older booster seats may not have attached <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>installation</b> and use, may not fit later model vehicles, may not conform to current safety recommendations and may have worn webbing.

40|$|Summary: The Web Ontology Language (OWL) {{provides}} a sophisticated language for building complex domain ontologies and {{is widely used}} in bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology. The Protégé-OWL ontology editing tool {{provides a}} query facility that allows composition and execution of queries with the human-readable Manchester OWL syntax, with syntax checking and entity label lookup. No equivalent query facility such as the Protégé Description Logics (DL) query yet exists in web form. However, many users interact with bio-ontologies such as chemical entities of biological interest and the Gene Ontology using their online Web sites, within which DL-based querying functionality is not available. To address this gap, we introduce the OntoQuery web-based query utility.

40|$|We present here HOBACGEN, a {{database}} system devoted to comparative genomics in bacteria. HOBACGEN contains all available protein genes from bacteria, archaea, and yeast, taken from SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL and classified into families. It also includes multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees built from these families. The database is organized under a client/server architecture {{with a client}} written in Java, which may run on any platform. This client integrates a graphical interface allowing users to select families according to various criteria and notably to select homologs common to a given set of taxa. This interface also allows users to visualize multiple alignments and trees associated to families. In tree displays, protein gene names are colored according to the taxonomy of the corresponding organisms. Users may access all information associated to sequences and multiple alignments by clicking on genes. This graphic tool thus gives a rapid and simple access to all data required to interpret homology relationships between genes and distinguish orthologs from paralogs. <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>installation</b> of the client or the server are available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The SDPA-C (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm – Completion method) is a soft-ware package {{designed}} for solving large scale sparse SDPs (semidefinite programming problems). In particular, the SDPA-C solves an SDP quite efficiently in computational time and memory if the aggregated sparsity {{pattern of the}} data matrices induces a sparse chordal extension of the aggregate sparsity pattern matrix; if not, the standard version of the SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm, SDPA solves the SDP faster. Using the positive definite matrix completion theory, the SDPA-C stores only sparse matrices and perform matrix computations that take advantages of their sparsity. For theoretical and technical details of the SDPA-C, see the papers Fukuda-Kojima-Murota-Nakata (2000) and Nakata-Fujisawa-Fukuda-Kojima-Murota (2003) listed in the references of this manual.
