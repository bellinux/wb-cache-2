These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic <b>interphase</b> karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E
5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} <b>interphase</b> karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during <b>interphase.</b> Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During <b>interphase</b> the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the <b>interphase</b> of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

40|$|Strategies {{which have}} been used in the {{synthesis}} of high temperature <b>interphases</b> with debond capability in oxide/oxide systems have been: (i) the formation of layered oxides (beta-aluminas or magnetoplumbites) with preferred crystal orientation due to in-situ interface reactions between phases deposited from vapour or liquid precursors and (ii) the deposition on fibre surfaces of complex oxides (vanadates and phosphates, principally of the rare earths) from colloidal precursors or by magnetron sputtering.

25|$|There {{are many}} nuclear {{staining}} patterns seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and <b>interphase</b> chromatin stain. This pattern {{is associated with}} anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to nucleosomal components, and anti-histone antibodies. There are two speckled patterns: fine and coarse. The fine speckled pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies. The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To. Nuclear membrane staining appears as a fluorescent ring around the cell nucleus and are produced by anti-gp210 and anti-p62 antibodies.

The material {{on either side of the}} interface may have large differences in mechanical properties which could leave the interface vulnerable to microcrack initiation during loading. Since this may lead to catastrophic failure of the composite, it is essential to understand the mechanical behavior of the fiber-matix interfaces at a microscopic level. It has been observed that in many cases the interface is not discontinuous, but rather forms a continuum of three dimensional <b>interphases</b> wherein the material properties vary gradually over a distance of a few microns.

40|$|In this talk, we {{will present}} some studies {{regarding}} <b>interphases</b> and dependences of the polymer matrix/substrate. Surfaces structuring and modification of substrates {{plays an important}} role in the studies of these dependences. For these goals, different modified surfaces can be used, chemically or physically. One type of surfaces used for these structures as PTFE (poly(tetrafluoroethylene)) nanoribbons on glass/Si substrate – a polymer induced alignment. It was observed that this anti-adhesive substrate can induce a oriented structure in polymer crystal structures like ε- PLC (poly(caprolactone)). Another type of modified surface structure used in our projects is chemically modified microstructures using micro-contact printing technique. Variation of the character of the surface, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, by chemical treatment leads to different molecular interactions and thus different <b>interphases</b> properties. The third polymer/substrate concept for <b>interphases</b> studies is a 3 D network confinement: well-defined network as Al templates and inhomogeneous network as porous glasses. A selective penetration of the polymer system into pores or preferential adsorption effect will be discussed. Nanocomposites made of silica nanoparticles- reactive polymers and alumina nanoparticles-SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber) give unique mechanical properties due to the combination of high elasticity with high strength. Investigation of <b>interphases</b> using different types of modified substrate will be point out from two ways: structure resolving, mechanical, dielectrical and calorimetrical properties. Conventional microscopic techniques, such as AFM and SEM, are specific for locally investigated structures on a nanometer scale. Using these complementary microscopic techniques, we are able to distinguish different topographic information of designed substrate. Moreover, in the view of the <b>interphases</b> investigation, HarmoniXTM AFM is used as a mechanical property mapping technique which is able to provide quantitative mechanical characterization of stiffness, elastic modulus, adhesion and energy dissipation of a polymer surface with high lateral resolution (> 20 nm). Mechanical properties are investigated using DMTA (dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer) and TMA (thermo-mechanical analysis) - for determining the static elastic modules of solid or solid-like sample (polymer matrix), being able to analyze and characterize bulk-like sample at lower or higher frequencies than the dispersion o polymer regime. The temperature range is 80 K- 500 K. Modulated differentia scanning calorimetry (MDSC) is used to examine chemical and physical aspect of the studied system. The simultaneous determination of chemical reaction heat and the specific heat capacity is used to study the curing behavior of nanocomposite network.
