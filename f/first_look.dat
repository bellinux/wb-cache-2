5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>look</b> of The Dirty Picture {{and a short}} teaser were {{launched}} online on 26 August 2011. The enthusiastic response even prompted its producers to consider a sequel. The film's trailer on YouTube got over 500,000 hits in one day and one million hits in two days. Meanwhile, the theatrical trailer was launched on 30 August at a single screen cinema in Bandra. The space was especially decorated to recreate the retro era.

5|$|The {{genesis of}} Radioland Murders came from {{executive}} producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline {{of the film}} during the writing phase of American Graffiti, viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda jerks solving a murder in a radio station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American Graffiti in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio <b>first</b> <b>look</b> deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually {{became the basis for}} Star Wars).|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must <b>first</b> <b>look</b> into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
5|$|IndiaGlitz called Manam, {{along with}} 1:Nenokkadine and Drushyam, the best {{experimental}} films in recent times. Manam, along with Minugurulu (2014), was nominated by the Telugu Film Producers Council to the Film Federation of India {{to be included}} {{on the list of}} 30 Indian films for the 87th Academy Awards, in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.

That stamp featured a still of Nageswara Rao from the film. The film was screened at the 45th International Film Festival of India on 29 November 2014, as a Homage to Nageswara Rao. In February 2015, the makers of Bandipotu (2015) released a poster featuring Sampoornesh Babu, Allari Naresh and Saptagiri, whose theme resembled the <b>first</b> <b>look</b> of Manam.|$|E
