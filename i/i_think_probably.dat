6000|$|Neither Hogg nor Scott, I think, was crafty {{enough to}} imitate the prosaic drawl of the printed {{broadside}} ballad, or the feeble interpolations with which the [...] "gangrel scrape-gut," [...] or bankelsanger, supplied gaps in his memory. The modern complete ballad-faker WOULD introduce such abject verses, but Scott and Hogg desired to decorate, not to debase, ballads with which they intermeddled, and we track them by their modern romantic touch when they interpolate. I take it, for this reason, that Hogg did not write stanzas xv., xviii. It was hardly in nature for Hogg, if he knew Ville de Grace in Normandy (a thing not very probable), to invent [...] "Billop-Grace" [...] as a popular corruption of the name--and a popular corruption it is, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Probably</b> the original maker of this stanza wrote, in line 4, [...] "alace," [...] an old spelling--not [...] "alas"--to rhyme with [...] "grace." ...|$|E

60|$|More {{discredit}} than {{he deserved}} fell upon Mr. Gladstone for this obnoxious defect. In announcing {{the commission of}} inquiry four years before, Lord John as prime minister had expressly said that {{the improvement of the}} universities should be treated as a subject by itself, and that the admission of dissenters ought to be reserved for future and separate consideration. Writing to Mr. Gladstone (Jan. 1854) he said, 'I do not want to stir the question in this bill,' but he would support a proposal in a separate bill by which the halls might be the means of admitting dissenters. Mr. Gladstone himself professed to take no strong line either way; but in a parliamentary case of this kind to take no line is not materially different from a line in effect unfriendly. Arthur Stanley pressed him as hard as he could. 'Justice to the university,' said Mr. Gladstone in reply, 'demands that it should be allowed to consider the question for itself.... Indeed, while I believe that the admission of dissenters without the breaking up of the religious teaching and the government of the university would be a great good, I am also of opinion that to give effect to that measure by forcible intervention of parliament would be a great evil. Whether it is an evil that must some day or other be encountered, the time has not yet, I think, arrived for determining.' The letter concludes with a remark of curious bearing upon the temper of that age. 'The very words,' he says to Stanley, 'which you have let fall upon your paper--"Roman catholics"--used in this connection, were enough to burn it through and through, considering we have a parliament which, were the measure of 1829 not law at this moment, would <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> refuse to make it law.' There is no reason to think this an erroneous view. Perhaps it would not be extravagant even to-day.|$|E

6000|$|But suppose {{now you are}} a servant, I mean a well-trained, expert, prosperous servant; {{would the}} world have no {{equivalent}} of you under the new order? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> it would. With a difference, there will be room for a vast body of servants in the Socialist State. But I {{think there will be}} very few servants to private people, and that the [...] "menial" [...] conception of a servant will have vanished in an entirely educated community. The domestic work of the ordinary home, one may prophesy confidently, will be very much reduced in the near future whether we move toward Socialism or no; all the dirt of coal, all the disagreeableness attendant upon lamps and candles, most of the heavy work of cooking will be obviated by electric lighting and heating, and much of the bedroom service dispensed with through the construction of properly equipped bath-dressing-rooms. In addition, it is highly probable {{that there will be a}} considerable extension of the club idea; ordinary people will dine more freely in public places, and conveniences for their doing so will increase. The single-handed servant will have disappeared, and if you are one of that class you must console yourself by thinking that under Socialism you would have been educated up to seventeen or eighteen and then equipped for some more interesting occupation. But there will remain much need of occasional help of a more skilled sort, in cleaning out the house thoroughly every now and then, probably with the help of mechanisms, in recovering and repairing furniture, and in all this sort of [...] "helping" [...] which will be done as between one social equal and another, many people who are now, through lack of opportunity and education, servants, will no doubt be employed. But where the better type of service will be found will probably be in the clubs and associated homes, where pleasant-mannered, highly-paid, skilful people will see to the ease and comfort of a considerable clientèle without either offence or servility. There still remains, no doubt, a number of valets, footmen, maids and so on, who under Socialism would not be servants at all, but something far better, more interesting and more productive socially.|$|E
