25|$|Not {{only have}} {{employees}} {{lost their jobs}} in the United States, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers. In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing {{it all over the}} Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem. The company decided to cut her benefits because it was costing them additional funds.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the fifth}} playoff series between these two teams. This was a rematch of the second-round series that took place the {{previous}} year, in which San Jose defeated Detroit in five games. After losing the first three games, Detroit won the next three, to force a seventh game. This was the eighth time this feat had been achieved in NHL history, {{the third time in}} the last two seasons, and the second time in the 2011 playoffs. Chicago had accomplished the same feat against Vancouver in the Quarterfinals, ultimately losing that series. Since the New York Islanders twice forced a game seven after being down 3–0 during the 1975 Stanley Cup playoffs, there had been 112 consecutive failed attempts to repeat that feat prior to the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, after which <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in three of the seven possible series. San Jose won the seventh game by a score of 3–2 to avoid becoming the fourth team in NHL history to lose a series after taking a 3–0 series lead. It allowed them their second consecutive trip to the Conference Finals. Six of the games were decided by only one goal; the only exception was a 3–1 win by Detroit in game six, in which Darren Helm of Detroit scored an empty net goal.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in {{the past}} that the Cardinal Protodeacon has himself been the person elected pope. In such an event, the {{announcement}} is made by the next senior Deacon, who has thus succeeded as Protodeacon. The last time the cardinal protodeacon was elected was in 1513 when Giovanni de Medici was elected as Pope Leo X and the next senior cardinal deacon Alessandro Farnese (the future Pope Paul III) made the announcement. [...] During the election of Pope Leo XIII in 1878 Protodeacon Prospero Caterini appeared and started to make the announcement but was physically incapable of completing it, so another made it for him.|$|E

Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who {{knew exactly what he was}} doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E

In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill, notifying the States General that [...] "The King will keep the proposal under advisement." [...] A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King's Offices.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Lloyd {{appeared}} {{twice at}} Hendon Magistrates Court and gave {{evidence of the}} abuse she had suffered from Dillon. [...] Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. [...] When asked by prosecutors how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied [...] "I cannot tell you, {{there were so many}} [...] [...] <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> for years, time after time, always when he is drunk." [...] By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. [...] She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. Virginia Woolf was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as [...] "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing." ...|$|E
500|$|The triple, {{in which}} the batter reaches third base without being put out and {{without the benefit of}} a fielding error, is often called the [...] "hardest part of the cycle" [...] to complete. Hitting a triple often comes under similar hit {{placement}} as a double, but may require impressive speed {{on the part of the}} runner. Because of this, it is rare to see a player with slower-than-average running speed complete the cycle, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> such as when catcher Bengie Molina hit for the cycle on July 16, 2010; Molina described himself as [...] "the [...] guy in baseball" [...] earlier that season. The MLB all-time leader in triples is Sam Crawford, who completed the three-base hit 309 times in his career; however, none of those triples was ever part of a cycle. Of the top five players in MLB history in triples, two – Honus Wagner and Roger Connorhave hit for the cycle: Connor in 1890 and Wagner in 1912. The MLB single-season record holder for triples, Chief Wilson, hit for the cycle in 1910, two years before his record-setting season in which he hit 36 triples.|$|E
