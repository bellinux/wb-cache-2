In this paper, we estimate the effect of six proposals on <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> ratios for 52 low-income countries. We find that, in the average scenario, at least 35 of these countries would see aid inflows equivalent to more than half of total public expenditure and 17 would cross the 75 percent threshold.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} growth effect {{associated}} with aid and its volatility {{during the period}} 1995 - 2008 {{in the case of}} five South Asian economies. The aid is classified into short impact, long impact and humanitarian aid. We obtained results for each of the country by employing two-stage least squares method. The results suggest that <b>gross</b> <b>aid</b> is positively associated with growth rate where as its volatility negatively effects growth rate South Asian countries. Short impact and long impact aid positively effect on growth rate whereas respective aid volatilities have negative affects on all the economies, excluding at least one country in each case.

40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability.

Although the more recent literature on aid is doubtful if aid only spurs growth in a in a good policy environment, the aid-institutional debate indicates a clear aid-institutional paradox, especially relating to the macroeconomic effects, the fiscal response, the absorptive capacity and the good governance aid debates. The literature further indicates that aid could serve as a barrier to vulnerable societies. From the donors' perspective, it is evident that quantity of aid does not imply quality and that the ultimate responsibility lies with recipient governments to ensure more efficient absorption of aid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Timely {{reliable}} data on aid {{flows to}} maternal, newborn, {{and child health}} are essential for assessing the adequacy of current levels of funding, and to promote accountability among donors for attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for child and maternal health. We provide global estimates of official development assistance (ODA) to maternal, newborn, and child health in 2003 and 2004, drawing on data reported by high-income donor countries and aid agencies to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation. METHODS: ODA was tracked on a project-by-project basis to 150 developing countries. We applied a standard definition of maternal, newborn, and child health across donors, and included not only funds specific to these areas, but also integrated health funds and disease-specific funds allocated on a proportional distribution basis, using appropriate factors. FINDINGS: Donor spending on activities related to maternal, newborn, and child health {{was estimated to be}} US 1990 million dollars in 2004, representing just 2 % of <b>gross</b> <b>aid</b> disbursements to developing countries. The 60 priority low-income countries that account for most child and newborn deaths received 1363 million dollars, or 3. 1 dollars per child. Across recipient countries, there is a positive association between mortality and ODA per head, although at any given rate of mortality for children aged younger than 5 years or maternal mortality, there is significant variation in the amount of ODA per person received by developing countries. INTERPRETATION: The current level of ODA to maternal, newborn, and child health is inadequate to provide more than {{a small portion of the}} total resources needed to reach the MDGs for child and maternal health. If commitments are to be honoured, global aid flows will need to increase sharply during the next 5 years. The challenge will be to ensure a sufficient share of these new funds is channelled effectively towards the scaling up of key maternal, newborn, and child health interventions in high priority countries...|$|R

Methods: The study group consisted of 30 monaural users of hearing aid with symmetrical moderate or moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears (15 males, 15 females), aged 45 - 65 years old with the mean of 57. 73 and SD of 8. 12 years. difference limen for intensity was measured at two frequencies, 500 Hz, 2000 Hz, and two intensity levels (10 dB SL, 40 dB SL). The results of fitted ears were compared with not-fitted ones. Results: The results of the study showed better difference limen for intensity scores at high frequency and high intensity levels. A significant lower difference limen for intensity in fitted ears was observed compared with not-fitted ears (p< 0. 05), while {{there was no significant difference}} between the difference limen for intensity in the two groups at 500 Hz with 10 dB SL intensity (p= 0. 132). Conclusion: Hearing <b>aid</b> use affects <b>intensity</b> discrimination performance. Besides, perceptual modification following use of hearing aid is confirmed by our study which suggests a possible functional plasticity due to hearing aid use. However, further...|$|R
40|$|Fires in {{vegetation}} are {{pointed out}} {{as one of}} the main factors that impact and threaten the conservation of biodiversity in environmental systems. In Brazil, in the state of Bahia, Chapada Diamantina {{is one of the most}} affected region by constant burning, requiring huge investment of financial resources to fight the fires. Hotspots data detected by satellite sensors have been used to identify areas of occurrence of fires. From these data, estimates are made about the possible location and extent of affected areas, highlighting the temporal / spatial dynamic of fires. This study aimed to analyze the spatial behavior of hotspots between the years 2000 to 2011 in the National Park of Chapada Diamantina, in order to identify the areas of greatest intensity of fire occurrence obtained with the <b>aid</b> of Kernel <b>intensity</b> estimation. To this end, was made a survey of georeferenced hotspots existing into the park, organized a database, and then, in a GIS environment, modeled the distribution pattern of the set of points. According to the analyzed data, about 439 hotspots were detected by sensors aboard NOAA satellites - NOAA 12 and - 15 in the last 12 years within the park boundaries. It was found that the year of higher incidence of hot spots in the park was in 2008, when 243 focuses were detected. The number of hotspots recorded in 2008 represents about 55 % of the total. It was found that 245 of the 439 spots detected were in the east border of the city of Mucugê (about 56 %). Pages: 6969 - 697...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The donor agency observes the true performance of the aid recipient with error. The donor agency itself operates under stochastically variables e¢ciency. The aid recipient experiences rent-seeking behaviour. E¤ort in the aid recipient is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in the aid recipient is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure. The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid,</b> in the sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance. Second, performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in the aid recipient will increase under strengthening performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid.</b> Thirdly, improving governance in the aid recipient in turn was shown to lead to increased budgetary allocations to aid in the legislature that allocates <b>aid</b> resources. Performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> thus has fundraising e¤ects. Policy slippage also carries impacts, however. The …rst of these is that the e¤ectiveness of the performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> appears to depend strongly on the degree of e¢ciency of own e¤ort in the aid recipient country. At the same time, the aid budget provided by the legislature for allocation by th...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of the aid recipient imperfectly; the donor agency and the aid recipient are subject to inefficiency; the aid recipient experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between the aid donor and the aid recipient are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in the aid recipient increase under performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid.</b> Moreover, performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> has fundraising effects. While the aid recipient also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for the poorest aid recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in the aid recipient. The importance of aid agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance <b>intensity</b> of <b>aid</b> maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by the aid recipient. Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 133 samples (53 {{fermented}} unprocessed, 19 fermented processed. 62 urea-treated processed) of whole crop wheat (WCW) and 16 samples (five fermented unprocessed, six fermented processed, five urea-treated processed) of whole crop barley (WCB) {{were collected from}} commercial farms over two consecutive years (2003 / 2004 and 2004 / 2005). Disruption of the maize grains to increase starch availability was achieved {{at the point of}} harvest by processors fitted to the forage harvesters. All samples were subjected to laboratory analysis whilst 50 of the samples (24 front Year 1, 26 front Year 2 all WCW except four WCB in Year 2) were subjected to in vivo digestibility and energy value measurements using mature wether sheep. Urea-treated WCW had higher (P< 0. 05) pH, and dry matter (DM) and crude protein contents and lower concentrations of fermentation products than fermented WCW. Starch was generally lower in fermented, unprocessed WCW and no effect of crop maturity at harvest (as indicated by DM content) on starch concentrations was seen. Urea-treated WCW had higher (P< 0. 05) in vivo digestible organic matter contents in the DM (DOMD) in Year 1 although this was not recorded in Year 2. There was a close relationship between the digestibility values of organic matter and <b>gross</b> energy thus <b>aiding</b> the use of DOMD to predict metabolisable energy (ME) content. A wide range of ME values was observed (WCW. 8. 7 - 11. 8 MJ/kg DM; WCB 7. 9 - 11. 2 MJ/kg DM) with the overall ME/DOMD ratio (ME = 0. 0156 DOMD) in line With Studies in other forages. There was no evidence that a separate ME/DOMD relationship was needed for WCB which is helpful for practical application. This ratio and other parameters were affected by year of harvest (P< 0. 05) highlighting the influence of environmental and Other undefined factors. The variability in the composition and nutritive value of WCW and WCB highlights the need for reliable and accurate evaluation methods to be available to assess the Value of these forages before they are included in diets for dairy cows.
