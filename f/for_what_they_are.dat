Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.|$|E

25|$|A map of {{recorded}} Māori archaeological {{sites for the}} Otago Conservancy shows many more on the Otago Peninsula than elsewhere in the region. Another showing only those of the Archaic period shows sites clustered on the peninsula and along the coast across the harbour {{to the west and}} north. This was one of three more or less distinct clusters on the South Island's south east coast: one from about Oamaru south to Pleasant River; another from Waikouaiti south, which includes the Otago Peninsula and tails off about the Kaikorai estuary; another extending south from the Clutha mouth. The clusters contain a few larger sites. On the Otago Peninsula the one at Little Papanui is of middle size while that at Harwood Township is one of the largest. These and numerous other smaller sites are clearly visible, though often not recognised by visitors <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
500|$|On the Charlie Rose talk show, Cameron {{acknowledged}} {{parallels with}} {{idea of the}} [...] "noble savage", but argued: [...] "When indigenous populations who are at a bow and arrow level are met with technological superior forces, [...] somebody doesn't help them, they lose. So {{we are not talking}} about a racial group within an existing population fighting for their rights." [...] Cameron rejected claims that the film is racist, asserting that Avatar is about respecting others' differences. [...] Adam Cohen of The New York Times felt similarly, writing that the Na'vi greeting [...] "I see you" [...] contrasts with the oppression of, and even genocide against, those who we fail to accept <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> citing Jewish ghettos and the Soviet gulags as examples.|$|E

[...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics warmly praised Whisky Galore! on its release. The {{reviewer}} C. A. Lejeune, {{writing in}} The Observer, considered it [...] "a film with the French genius in the British manner", while the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought {{the film was}} [...] "put together with... tact and subtlety", and Henry Raynor, in his review for Sight & Sound magazine, called it [...] "one of the best post-war British films". Several critics identified the script as excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that the main credit for the film {{should be given to}} Mackenzie and MacPhail for the story. Lejeune thought that the story was treated [...] "with the sort of fancy that is half childlike and half agelessly wise: it accepts facts <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and only tilts their representation, ever so slightly, towards the fantastic and the humorous".|$|E
500|$|The {{period from}} 1866 to 1884 is {{characterized}} by his major illustrated stories, such as Helen Who Couldn't Help It. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in Painter Squirtle (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a pedant. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous. The early stories follow the pattern of children's books of orthodox education, such as those by Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter, that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour. Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: [...] "I look at my things <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> as Nuremberg trinkets , as Schnurr Pfeiferen [...] whose value {{is to be found}} not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)".|$|E
500|$|The {{shock and}} {{confusion}} {{with which the}} male characters in [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] react to the Woods scandal, and the extreme measures they undertake to learn why rich and successful men crave sex, served as a parody to the wide media attention and analysis the scandal received. The episode puts forward a pragmatic explanation that it is natural for men to crave sex, so although Woods's actions cannot be condoned, they can at least be understood <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> This point of view particularly conveyed in the speech of one SWAT team member {{near the end of}} the episode, who is ostracized, imprisoned and unknowingly shot to death by Kyle and Butters after expressing his common sense views. The episode suggests men of normal financial means would likely be tempted by infidelity and sexual affairs if they had enough fame and money to obtain them easily.|$|E
2500|$|The book's {{publication}} was {{an extraordinary}} event in Soviet literary history since never before had an account of Stalinist repression been openly distributed.

And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to do my best to be that image in Dexter's mind."

2500|$|The poem betrays a {{particular}} animus for Mary Wollstonecraft and, by extension, others Polwhele {{considered to be}} of her radical, pro-French camp: writers Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Mary Robinson, Charlotte Turner Smith, Helen Maria Williams, Ann Yearsley, Mary Hays and Ann Jebb, and artists Angelica Kauffman and Emma Crewe. Strangely, perhaps, only Hays, Jebb and Smith shared political sympathies with Wollstonecraft, and Smith, by 1798, had {{turned her back on}} her previous ideas. The others, though, in different ways, all fell afoul of restrictive ideas of female (and class) decorum. Yearsley, for example, a labouring-class poet who had a dispute with her patron, Hannah More, is accused of longing [...] "to rustle, like her sex, in silk" [...] (l.102). According to one editor, [...] "one can only conclude that Polwhele attacks these women not <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not: they are unsexed, unfeminine, either because they are immodest, or unsentimental, or insubordinate.

[...] Of this transgressive group, Polwhele invites the reader: ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the opponents}} of Batista, many wanted to {{accommodate}} the United States. However, Castro belonged to a faction which opposed U.S. influence. Castro did not forgive the U.S. supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, {{at the height of}} the revolution, he had written: [...] "The Americans are going to pay dearly <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing. When the war is over, I'll start a much longer and bigger war of my own: the war I’m going to fight against them. That will be my true destiny". (The United States had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba). Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the United States. [...] "Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country's oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States".|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{contemporary}} parallel for {{the role}} of Fool in the court of kings. As Shakespeare conceives it, the Fool is a servant and subject to punishment ('Take heed, sirrah [...] the whip ' 1:4:104) and yet Lear's relationship with his fool is one of friendship and dependency. The Fool acts as a commentator on events {{and is one of the}} characters (Kent being the other) who is fearless in speaking the truth. The Fool provides wit in this bleak play and unlike some of Shakespeare's clowns who seem unfunny to us today because their topical jokes no longer make sense, the Fool in King Lear ridicules Lear's actions and situation in such a way that audiences understand the point of his jokes. His 'mental eye' is the most acute in the beginning of the play: he sees Lear's daughters <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> and has the foresight to see that Lear's decision will prove disastrous.|$|E
