40|$|The Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field {{controls}} {{to a degree}} the strength, geographic positioning, and structure of currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, which produce their own (external) magnetic fields. The secular variation of the Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field can therefore lead to long-term changes in the externally produced magnetic field as well. Here we will examine this more closely. First, we obtain scaling relations to describe how the strength of magnetic perturbations associated with various different current systems in the ionosphere and magnetosphere depends on the <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field intensity. Second, we discuss how changes in the orientation of a simple dipolar magnetic field will affect the current systems. Third, we use model simulations to study how actual changes in the Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field between 1908 and 2008 have affected some of the relevant current systems.

Frequency tuning of these components has so far been obtained by external magnetic fields provided by a permanent magnet or by passing current through coils. However, for high frequency operation the permanent part of magnetic bias should be as high as possible, which requires large permanent magnets resulting in relatively large size and high cost microwave passive components. A promising approach to circumvent this problem is to use hexaferrites, such as BaFe 12 O 19 and SrFe 12 O 19, which have high effective <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> anisotropy that also contributes to the permanent bias.
