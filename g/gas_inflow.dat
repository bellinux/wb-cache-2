METHODS: The study was both prospective and randomized, including 56 patients (28 patients in each group) scheduled for elective surgery of an expected anaesthesia time of at least 120 min. Inspired and end-tidal concentrations of desflurane were measured during low-flow anaesthesia with fresh <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> of 1. 0 and 2. 0 L min- 1. The vaporizer setting was fixed at 5 % desflurane. RESULTS: The inspired and end-tidal concentrations of desflurane in the 1. 0 L min- 1 group after 120 min were 4. 54 % vs. 4. 37 % (P < 0. 001). In the 2. 0 L min- 1 group, the inspired and end-tidal concentrations of desflurane were 4. 76 % vs. 4. 58 % (P < 0. 001). The estimated end-tidal/inspired ratios at 120 min of anaesthesia were 0. 96 in both groups. At a fresh gas flow of 1. 0 L min- 1, the end-tidal concentration was 0. 87 of the vaporizer setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ultrafast 2 -dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequence (temporal resolution 100 milliseconds) was used for dynamic ventilation (3) He-MRI of 11 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. The applied (3) He gas bolus was varied in volume between 100 and 200 mL. A 150 -mL bolus was varied in its application time after the beginning of the tidal volume between 0 and 1200 milliseconds. Signal kinetics were evaluated using an in-house developed software after definition of parameters for the quantitative description of (3) He <b>gas</b> <b>inflow.</b> RESULTS: The signal rise time (time interval between signal in the parenchyma reaches 10 % and 90 % of its maximum) was prolonged with increasing bolus volume. The parameter was shortened with increasing delay of (3) He application after the beginning of the tidal volume. Timing variation as well as volume variation showed no clear interrelation to the signal delay time 10 (time interval between signal in the trachea reaches 50 % of its maximum and signal in the parenchyma reaches 10 % of its maximum).

We analyse {{the evolution of the}} slope of oxygen abundance profiles and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) along their evolution. We find that galaxy-galaxy interactions could generate either positive and negative gas-phase oxygen profiles depending on the state of evolution. Along the interaction, galaxies are found to have metallicity gradients and sSFR consistent with observations, on average. Strong <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> produced during galaxy-galaxy interactions or as a result of strong local instabilities in gas-rich discs are able to produce both a quick dilution of the central gas-phase metallicity and a sudden increase of the sSFR. Our simulations show that, during these events, a correlation between the metallicity gradients and the sSFR can be set up if strong <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> are triggered in the central regions in short timescales. Simulated galaxies without experiencing strong disturbances evolve smoothly without modifying the metallicity gradients. Gas-rich systems show large dispersion along the correlation. The dispersion in the observed relation could be interpreted as produced by the combination of galaxies with different gas-richness and/or experiencing different types of interactions. Hence, our findings suggest that the observed relation might be the smoking gun of galaxies forming in a hierarchical clustering scenario. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

In agreement with previous works, we find that tidally induced low-metallicity <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> dilute the central oxygen abundance {{and contribute to the}} flattening of the metallicity gradients. The tidally induced inflows trigger starbursts which increase the impact of Type II supernova (SN II) feedback injecting new chemical elements and driving galactic winds which modulate the metallicity distribution. Although α-enhancement in the central regions is detected {{as a result of the}} induced starbursts in agreement with previous works, our simulations suggest that this parameter can only provide a timing of the first pericentre mainly for non-retrograde encounters. In order to reproduce wet major mergers at low and high redshifts, we have run simulations with respectively 20 and 50 per cent of the disc in the form of gas. We find that the more gas-rich encounters behave similarly to the less rich ones, between the first and second pericentre, where low-metallicity <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> are triggered. However, the higher strength of the inflows triggered in the more gas-rich interactions produces larger metal dilution factors, which are modulated afterwards by the new chemical production by SN. We find that the more gas-rich interaction develops violent and clumpy star formation triggered by local instabilities all over the disc before the first pericentre, so that if these galaxies were observed at these early stages where no important tidally induced inflows have been able to be developed yet, they would tend to show an excess of oxygen. We find a global mean correlation of both the central abundances and the gradients with the strength of the star formation activity. However, the correlations are affected by orbital parameters, <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> and outflows, suggesting that it might be difficult to determine it from observations.

This study is designed to investigate the effects of different fresh gas flow during induction, the vital capacity induction (VCI) vs. the tidal volume breath induction (TBI) on the compound-A production with a fresh Sofnolime or a dehydrated Sofnolime using a simulated lung model. Method: The experiments were randomly divided into four groups: group one, VCIf, vital capacity fresh <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> with fresh Sofnolime; group two, TBIf, tidal volume breath fresh <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> with fresh Sofnolime; group three, VCId, vital capacity fresh <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> with dehydrated Sofnolime, and group four, TBId, tidal volume breath fresh <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> with dehydrated Sofnolime. The inspired sevoflurane was maintained at 8 %, the concentrations of compound-A were assayed using Gas-spectrum technique, and Sofnolime temperatures were monitored at 1 -min intervals throughout the experiment. Results: The mean and maximum concentrations of compound A were significantly higher in the vital capacity group than the tidal volume breath group (P&# 60; 0. 01).

We measure metallicities by exploiting strong emission line diagnostics. We found that a significant fraction of star-forming galaxies at z~ 3. 4 deviate from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), with a metallicity up to a factor of ten lower than expected according to the FMR. This deviation does not correlate with the dynamical properties of the galaxy or with the presence of interactions. To investigate the origin of the metallicity deviations in more detail, we also infer information on the gas content, by inverting the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. In agreement with recent CO observational data, we found that, in contrast with the steeply rising trend at 0 <z< 2, the gas fraction in massive galaxies remains constant, with indication of a marginal decline, at 2 <z< 3. 5. When combined with the metallicity information, we infer that to explain both the low metallicity and gas content in z~ 3. 4 galaxies, both prominent outflows and massive pristine <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> are needed.

While massive, rotation-dominated disks are already in place at z~ 2, they are dynamically hotter compared to spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Although several plausible mechanisms have been proposed (e. g., star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or galaxy interaction), it remains unclear what is the fundamental driver of the velocity dispersion enhancement at high-z. We investigate {{the origin of this}} kinematic evolution using a suite of cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project. Although the velocity dispersion of simulated galaxies is systematically lower compared to the observed values, the simulations successfully reproduce the observed trends between velocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift. In the FIRE simulations, the variation in velocity dispersion is highly dynamic across cosmic time, and it can vary significantly within a timescale of 100 Myr. These variations closely mirror the evolution of star formation and <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> histories. By cross-correlating any two parameters of velocity dispersion, <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> rates, and SFR, we show that the increase of gas inflowing into the galaxy lead to the subsequent star formation activities, and the enhancement of velocity dispersion follows closely in time with the increasing <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> rates and SFR...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate the impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in massive galaxies. We isolate the impact of AGN by comparing two simulations from the HORIZON suite, which are identical except that one also includes supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and related feedback models. This allows us to cross-identify individual galaxies between simulations and quantify the effect of AGN feedback on their properties, including stellar mass and gas outflows. We find that massive galaxies (M_* ≥ 10 ^ 11 [*]M_⊙) are quenched by AGN feedback {{to the extent that}} their stellar masses decrease by up to 80 [*]per[*]cent at z =  0. SMBHs affect their host halo through a combination of outflows that reduce their baryonic mass, particularly for galaxies in the mass range 10 ^ 9 [*]M_⊙ ≤ M_* ≤ 10 ^ 11 [*]M_⊙, and a disruption of central <b>gas</b> <b>inflows,</b> which limits in situ star formation.

40|$|The {{growth of}} black holes (BHs) in disk galaxies lacking {{classical}} bulges, which implies {{an absence of}} significant mergers, appears {{to be driven by}} secular processes. Short bars of sub-kiloparsec radius have been hypothesized to be an important mechanism for driving <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> to small scale, feeding central BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this mechanism, we examine the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence of BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to be robust, long-lived structures; extremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely destroy such bars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in large-scale outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass M_ bh∼ 0. 05 - 0. 2 % of the total stellar mass (M_) are present. In agreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host short bars have BHs with a mass fraction less than 0. 2 %M_. Thus the dissolution of short inner bars is possible, perhaps even frequent, in the universe. An important implication of this result is that inner bar-driven <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> may be terminated when BHs grow to ∼ 0. 1 %M_. We predict that 0. 2 %M_ is the maximum mass of BHs allowed if they are fed predominately via inner bars. This value matches well the maximum ratio of BH-to-host galaxy stellar mass observed in galaxies with pseudo-bulges and most nearby AGN host galaxies. This hypothesis provides a novel explanation for the lower M_ bh/M_ in galaxies which have avoided significant mergers compared with galaxies with classical bulges.

For this purpose, we solve the equations for the evolutions of the surface mass densities of gas and metals at each radius in a galactic disk, based on the observed structural properties of distant star-forming galaxies, including the redshift evolution of their stellar mass distribution, their scaling relation between the mass of baryonic components, star formation rate (SFR) and chemical abundance, as well as the supposed evolution of their radial metallicity gradients (RMGs). We find that the efficiency of <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> for a given SFR decreases with time and that the inflow rate is always nearly proportional to the SFR. For gas outflow, although its efficiency for a given SFR is a decreasing function of time, similarly to <b>gas</b> <b>inflow,</b> the outflow rate is not necessarily proportional to the SFR and the relation between the outflow rate and SFR strongly depends on the evolution of the adopted RMG. We also find that the results on the outflow rate can be reproduced in the framework of momentum-driven (energy-driven) wind mechanism if the RMG is steepening (flattening) with time. Therefore if the well measured RMGs and their evolution for Milky Way-like galaxies are obtained from future observations, then our results will be useful to constrain the main driving mechanism for their galactic outflows.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{phases of the}} pairing and sinking of BHs in galaxy mergers and circunmunclear disks {{in light of the}} results of recent {{simulations}} with massive BHs embedded in predominantly gaseous backgrounds. After a general overview we discuss the importance of a fast orbital decay regime dominated by global disk torques rather than by the local dynamical friction wake. This regime can dominate at BH binary separations of a few tens of parsecs and below, following a phase of orbital circularization dominated by local dynamical friction. It is similar to Type-I migration in planetary evolution. It can bring the black holes to separations small enough for gravitational waves to take over on a timescale ranging from less than ∼ 10 ^ 7 yr to up to 10 ^ 8 yr, depending on whether the interstellar medium is smooth or clumpy. Eventual gap opening at sub-pc scale separations slows down but does not interrupt the orbital decay. Subsequently, we discuss a new intriguing connection between the conditions required for rapid orbital decay of massive BH binaries and those required for prominent <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> in gas-rich galaxies. We derive a condition for the maximum inflow rate that a circumnuclear disk can host while still maintaining a sufficiently high gas density at large radii to sustain the decay of a BH binary. We find that <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> rates exceeding 10 M_/yr, postulated to form massive BH seeds in some direct collapse models, would stifle the sinking of massive BH binaries in gas-dominated galactic nuclei. Vice-versa, lower inflow rates, below a solar mass per year, as required to feed typical AGNs, are compatible with a fast orbital decay of BH binaries across a wide range of masses.

40|$|Galaxy-galaxy {{interactions}} are predicted to cause <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> leading to enhanced nuclear star formation. In this paper we test the further prediction that the <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> lead to enhanced accretion onto the central supermassive black hole, triggering {{activity in the}} nucleus. Based on a sample of 11, 060 SDSS galaxies with a close companion (rp < 80 kpc, Delta V < 200 km/s), we classify AGN based either on emission line ratios or on spectral classification as a quasar. The AGN fraction in the close pairs sample is compared to a control sample of 110, 600 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies with no nearby companion. We find a clear increase in the AGN fraction in close pairs of galaxies with projected separations < 40 kpc by up to a factor of 2. 5 relative to the control sample (although the enhancement depends on the chosen S/N cut of the sample). The increase in AGN fraction is strongest in equal mass galaxy pairings, and weakest in the lower mass component of an unequal mass pairing. The increased AGN fraction at small separations is accompanied by an enhancement {{in the number of}} `composite' galaxies whose spectra are the result of photoionization by both AGN and stars. Our results indicate that AGN activity occurs (at least in some cases) well before final coalescence and concurrently with ongoing star formation. Finally, we find a marked increase at small projected separations of the fraction of pairs in which BOTH galaxies harbour AGN. We demonstrate that the fraction of double AGN exceeds the expected random fraction, indicating that some pairs undergo correlated nuclear activity. Taken together with complimentary studies, we favour an interpretation where interactions trigger AGN, but are not the only cause of nuclear activity. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We analyse a set {{of galaxy}} {{interactions}} performed by using a self-consistent chemo-hydrodynamical model which includes star formation, Supernova feedback and chemical evolution. In agreement with previous works, we find that tidally-induced low-metallicity <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> dilute the central oxygen abundance {{and contribute to the}} flattening of the metallicity gradients. The tidally-induced inflows trigger starbursts which increase the impact of SN II feedback injecting new chemical elements and driving galactic winds which modulate the metallicity distribution. Although α-enhancement in the central regions is detected {{as a result of the}} induced starbursts in agreement with previous works, our simulations suggest that this parameter can only provide a timing of the first pericentre mainly for non-retrograde encounters. In order to reproduce wet major mergers at low and high redshifts, we have run simulations with respectively 20 and 50 percent of the disc in form of gas. We find that the more gas-rich encounters behave similarly to the less rich ones, between the first and second pericentre where low-metallicity <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> are triggered. However, the higher strength of the inflows triggered in the more gas-rich interactions produces larger metal dilutions factors which are afterward modulated by the new chemical production by Supernova. We find that the more gas-rich interaction develops violent and clumpy star formation triggered by local instabilities all over the disc before the first pericentre, so that if these galaxies were observed at these early stages where no important tidally-induced inflows have been able to develop yet, they would tend to show an excess of oxygen. We find a global mean correlation of both the central abundances and the gradients with the strength of the star formation activity.

40|$|Keck OSIRIS/LGSAO {{observations}} of the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS~ 23365 + 3604 resolve a circumnuclear bar (or irregular disk) of semimajor axis 0. 42 " (520 pc) in Paschen-alpha emission. The line-of-sight velocity of the ionized gas increases from the northeast toward the southwest; this gradient is perpendicular to the photometric major axis of the infrared emission. Two pairs of bends in the zero-velocity line are detected. The inner bend provides evidence for <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> onto the circumnuclear disk/bar structure. We interpret the gas kinematics on kiloparsec scales {{in relation to the}} molecular gas disk and multiphase outflow discovered previously. In particular, the fast component of the outflow (detected previously in line wings) is not detected, adding support to the conjecture that the fast wind originates well beyond the nucleus. These data directly show the dynamics of <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> and outflow in the central kiloparsec of a late-stage, gas-rich merger and demonstrate the potential of integral field spectroscopy to improve our understanding of the role of gas flows during the growth phase of bulges and supermassive black holes.

40|$|Europa is {{believed}} to have formed near the very end of Jupiter's own accretion, within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid particles. We review the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final stages of <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would have accreted slowly, in more than 10 ^ 5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter. Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last generation that survived as <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> to Jupiter ended. We conclude by discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation. Comment: 62 pages, 7 figures. To appear in "Europa", University of Arizona Pres...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanism of excessive gas accumulation in the abomasum in bovine abomasal displacement, we performed gastric fluoroscopy in vagotomized cattle. Fifteen 6 -month-old Holstein steers were divided into three groups: a non-vagotomized control group (Group C; n= 5), a ventral thoraco-vagotomized group (Group V; n= 5), and a dorsal and ventral thoraco-vagotomized group (Group DV; n= 5). These groups were examined by fluoroscopy before and during a 5 -week observation period after surgery. In Group C, no change was observed throughout the observation period. In Group DV, immediately after surgery, reticuloruminal motility was completely absent and ruminal distention was seen. Two weeks after surgery, abnormal reticulum motility and increased gas accumulation in the abomasal body were noted. Abomasal dilatation was also observed. In Group V, 1 week after surgery, <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> into the abomasum and relatively normal reticulum motility were observed along with a rapid increase in abomasal gas. Abomasal dilatation was also observed. In addition, left-displaced abomasum occurred {{in one of the}} steers in this group. From these results, we concluded that one of the mechanisms of excessive gas accumulation in the abomasum is reticulum-mediated <b>gas</b> <b>inflow</b> from the rumen combined with vagotomy-induced hypomotility.

40|$|In {{this review}} I {{demonstrate}} that a realistic {{model for the}} formation of galaxy disks depends on a proper treatment of the gas in galaxies. Historically, cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation have suffered from a lack of resolution and a physically motivated feedback prescription. Recent computational progress has allowed for unprecedented resolution, which in turn allows for a more realistic treatment of feedback. These advances have led to a new examination of gas accretion, evolution, and loss in the formation of galaxy disks. Here I highlight the role that <b>gas</b> <b>inflows,</b> the regulation of gas by feedback, and gas outflows play in achieving simulated disk galaxies that better match observational results as a function of redshift.

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} {{theoretical}} and simulation results on star and structure formation in galaxy interactions and mergers is reviewed, and recent hydrodynamic simulations are presented. The role of gravity torques and ISM turbulence in galaxy interactions, {{in addition to}} the tidal field, is highlighted. Interactions can drive <b>gas</b> <b>inflows</b> towards the central kpc and trigger a central starburst, the intensity and statistical properties of which are discussed. A kinematically decoupled core and a supermassive central black hole can be fueled. Outside of the central kpc, many structures can form inside tidal tails, collisional ring, bridges, including super star clusters and tidal dwarf galaxies. The formation of super star clusters in galaxy mergers can now be directly resolved in hydrodynamic simulations. Their formation mechanisms and long-term evolution are reviewed, and the connection with present-day early-type galaxies is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cold Fronts and shocks are {{hallmarks}} {{of the complex}} intra-cluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters. They are thought to occur due to gas motions within the ICM and are often attributed to galaxy mergers within the cluster. Using hydro-cosmological simulations of clusters of galaxies, we show that collisions of <b>inflowing</b> <b>gas</b> streams, seen to penetrate to the very centre of about half the clusters, offer an additional mechanism {{for the formation of}} shocks and cold fronts in cluster cores. Unlike episodic merger events, a <b>gas</b> stream <b>inflow</b> persists {{over a period of several}} Gyrs and it could generate a particular pattern of multiple cold fronts and shocks.
