25|$|A {{week before}} his 69th birthday, he was {{bedridden}} and infirm. His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, the ashtray was by his bedside {{next to a}} radio tuned to ABC Radio National. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.|$|E
2500|$|Best {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his adult life, leading to numerous controversies and, eventually, his death. In 1981, while playing in the United States, Best stole money from the handbag of a woman he did not know in order to fund a drinking session. [...] "We were sitting in a bar on the beach, and when she got up to go to the toilet <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and took all the money she had in her bag." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> Joe, and, {{with the}} aid of my {{forefinger}} read him the whole letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the collision," [...] {{said the}} Tin Woodman regretfully. [...] "I knew {{something}} was wrong with me, and now I can see that my side is dented in so that <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> toward the left. It was the Soldier's fault; he shouldn't have been so careless." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> saw her <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the gallery, her linked hands {{white as}} pearl against the oak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Farewell," [...] said <b>I,</b> as we <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the vessel's {{side and}} gazed sadly at the {{receding}} shore--"farewell to you, kind missionaries and faithful negro friends." ...|$|R
60|$|After the day's uproar, the tranquillity of {{the scene}} was soothing, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side to enjoy it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{and spoke}} to it. I asked it if my heart would ever know love. It said it thought so.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{question}} {{came with}} the simplicity of a child. She laughed softly with pleasure when <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the table and whispered to her,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] {{continued}} Kelly. [...] "In {{the excitement}} of watching my uncle I forgot where <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> too far <b>over</b> and {{fell out of the}} trap. I landed on uncle, just as {{he was sitting on the}} table to shoot. He fell." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} the exact {{direction of his}} steadfast gaze and I became cold with apprehension. Lady Orstline was {{just in front of}} me; by her side was Eve, and immediately behind her Mr. Parker, <b>I</b> tried to <b>lean</b> <b>over,</b> but in the crush it was impossible.|$|R
60|$|All of {{this was}} {{performed}} in profound silence. There was no sound in the cone, except that of the voice, no rustle of garments, no grasp of fingers on the tin; and though <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>over,</b> and once more placed my ear close to the psychic's lips, I could not trace the slightest movement connecting her with the movements on the table. I had the conviction {{at the moment that}} she sat in a death-like trance at my side.|$|R
60|$|Mabane and Arthur {{had gone}} {{out to have a}} smoke. I had still a moment before the curtain went up. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards Isobel.|$|E
6000|$|Snatching my trumpet, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the rail}} and shouted with all my might: [...] "Did you hear me say I loved her? Did you tell her?" ...|$|E
60|$|On such a night, and all alone, reverie was inevitable. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side, {{and could}} not help {{thinking}} of the strange objects we might be sailing over.|$|E
40|$|For {{voice and}} piano. Till I wake (When <b>I</b> am dying, <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> me tenderly, softly). Kashmiri song (Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar).

60|$|At {{the end of}} a week Sophy {{fell into}} a long sleep, so quiet and still, that <b>I</b> several times <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her to see that she still breathed. This sleep the doctors said was the crisis of her illness, and upon the state in which she woke {{depended}} her life and reason.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> despairingly <b>over</b> the rail, {{watching}} the trim little schooner swiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us. And {{she would probably}} be in San Francisco in five or six hours! My head seemed bursting. There was an ache in my throat as though my heart were up in it. A curling wave struck the side and splashed salt spray on my lips. The wind puffed strongly, and the Ghost heeled far over, burying her lee rail. I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck.|$|R
60|$|Benson {{died that}} night. He {{remained}} defiant {{almost to the}} last; but just before he went out, he motioned to me, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to catch the faintly whispered words.|$|E
60|$|Evidently he was {{the only}} other prisoner. As he slept <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and looked at him. There was {{something}} strangely familiar about his face, and yet I could not place him.|$|E
6000|$|But {{they had}} already gone. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bank, and called after their {{vanishing}} figures,--"What did you say I could do?" [...] The answer floated slowly up on the hot, sluggish air,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|My nights were pestered with {{dreams and}} my days with their {{vanishing}} spectres; and I had no Pollie {{to tell me}} what they forecast. I suppose one must be more miserable and hunted in mind even than I was, never to be a little sentimental when alone. <b>I</b> would <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the cold mouth of the well, just able to discern in the cold mirror of water, far beneath, the face I was almost astonished to find reflected there. [...] "Shall I come too?" [...] I would morbidly whisper, and dart away.|$|R
6000|$|The morn {{when first}} it thunders in March, [...] The eel {{in the pond}} gives a leap, they say; [...] As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> and looked <b>over</b> the aloed arch [...] Of the villa-gate this warm March day, [...] No flash snapped, no dumb thunder rolled [...] 5 [...] In the valley beneath where, white and wide [...] And washed by the morning water-gold, [...] Florence lay out on the mountain-side.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, my {{aim is to}} {{establish}} an Archeology of Madness and to seek highlight the madman and the madness in the meeting of philosophical underpinnings with scientific and technological framework. In this sense, <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> for two possibilities of understanding the madman whose ultimate consequence is to back for an Ethics of Alterity. In other words, I seek to build {{a look at the}} Homo sapiens sapiens differences – at the man as previously defined concept - from Michel Foucault´s view on Histoire de la folie à l’age classique. Moreover, I try to analyze this Archeology of Madness as a possibility of prior understanding of the structures of biopower. No presente artigo, visando uma Arqueologia da Loucura e buscando ? no encontro dos fundamentos filosóficos com o arcabouço científico e tecnológico – pincelar um olhar para o louco e para a loucura, me debruço sobre duas possibilidades de compreensão do louco cuja consequência última se volta para uma Ética da Alteridade. Ou seja, busco construir um olhar para a diferença inerente ao Homo sapiens sapiens através da leitura de Michel Foucault em Histoire de la folie à l’age classique. Ademais, busco analisar esta Arqueologia da Loucura como uma possibilidade de compreensão prévia das estruturas de biopoder. ...|$|R
60|$|And as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the rail}} methought {{that all the}} little stars in the water were shaking with austere merriment! But {{it may have been}} only the ripple of the steamer, after all.|$|E
60|$|He left me, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the rail}} {{of the bridge}} looking over the side. I dared not raise my eyes. Yet {{it had to be}} done--and, indeed, I could not have helped myself. I believe I trembled.|$|E
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} there came to our ears {{distinctly}} three smart raps on the outer door, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> Master Lord with my knife upraised, for I knew that now was come our time of greatest peril.|$|E
60|$|The game {{continued}} {{a little}} longer, but Lop-Ear did not expose himself a second time. Then the Fire-Man gave it up. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> far out <b>over</b> my horizontal limb and chattered down at him. I wanted to play. I {{wanted to have}} him try to hit me with the thing. He saw me, but ignored me, turning his attention to Broken-Tooth, who was still teetering slightly and involuntarily {{on the end of}} the branch.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave them}} a table not far away from mine. The memory of {{his face as he}} preceded them down the room never left me. I glanced instinctively towards Delora. His back was turned towards the {{entrance}} of the restaurant, and he had apparently seen nothing. Felicia, on the contrary, sat as though she were turned to stone. <b>I</b> saw her <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> and whisper to her companion. A little murmur of excitement broke from my companion's lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{thought you}} prayed for me--and I could {{see you and}} hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote {{on a piece of}} {{sycamore}} bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' {{and put it on the}} table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought <b>I</b> went and <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and kissed you on the lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] I cried, laughing, [...] "come {{out of your}} shell. No Mahar eyes {{can reach}} you here," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and {{snatched}} the lion skin from her. And then I shrank back upon my seat in utter horror.|$|E
6000|$|She did not turn, But passed foot-faint with averted head In {{her gown}} of green, by the bobbing fern, Though <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the gate that led From where we waited with table spread; [...] But {{she did not}} turn: Why was she near there if love had fled? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{sudden and}} ridiculously obvious idea struck {{me for the}} first time. A small {{electric}} bell and telephone instrument were {{by the side of the}} bed. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and pressed the knob with my finger. My companion half glanced towards me, and back again instantly towards the door.|$|E
60|$|Forgetting the danger, in my {{eagerness to}} know what might follow this new method of attack, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>over</b> the {{fortification}} until {{it was possible for}} me to see, in the distance, the Britishers coming once more upon us, and that scene was not calculated to give me courage, for I soon understood that the king's soldiers were making better preparations than they had in the past attempts. Instead of climbing the hill laden with heavy knapsacks and sweltering in thick, tightly-fitting uniforms, they had cast aside all that might impede or distress them, and even like the rag-tag, they counted on fighting in their shirt-sleeves as should have been done on such a hot day when they first set the pace.|$|R
500|$|... "get {{it out of}} here, get it {{away from}} the guys and myself. And <b>I</b> reached <b>over,</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as hard as I could, what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|R
5000|$|Frances Keene called The Vagabond an [...] "enchanting, {{sincere and}} beautifully {{constructed}} novel" [...] in a 1955 review for The New York Times. Keene complimented the book's English translation, but wrote: [...] "It is a pity that its title {{has had to}} be transliterated. What 'La Vagabonde' means, of course, is 'The Wanderer,' as Renee Nere points out when considering second marriage: 'I shall have everything ... and <b>I</b> shall <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> {{the edge of a}} white terrace smothered with the roses of my gardens and shall see the lords of the earth, the wanderers, pass by!'" [...] Keene ended the review: [...] "Colette has the natural sober tone, the importance attached to feelings, the graceful brevity which Maurois once said 'define one of the forms of the French novel.' But above all her occasional hoarse cry of loss voices the complex anguish of our time." ...|$|R
