40|$|Abstract—A {{critical}} review is conducted based on analytical simulations of an experimental study to measure change in weight of sheep upon death published in 2001 by L. E. Hollander in JSE. The experimental system is modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom vibrating system. The following conclusions are obtained. (1) The experimental result obtained with Sheep # 7 {{appears to be}} natural, as expected by the theoretical model. (2) Hollander’s conclusion that “there was a transient gain of weight of 780 grams ” {{in the case of}} Sheep # 7 is not an appropriate expression of the experimental result, because the 780 gf pulse includes an overshoot reaction of the system; however, the cause of the force event remains to be explained. Analytical simulation of a supposed weight measurement experiment involving an out-of-body experience (OBE) subject is carried out using the theoretical model under a supposed weight decrease of the <b>experient.</b> The simulation showed that the disturbance caused by breathing becomes the primary noise in the system response. However, some noise reduc-tion techniques can be used to discern the change in the weight of the <b>experient,</b> if there indeed is a weight decrease.

40|$|Communiqué {{experienced}} {{within the}} context of adult bereavement is a complex multi-layered intersubjective event. Occurring generally though not always {{at a time when the}} bereaved individual is in despair or suffering anguish at the death and absence of the person/s close to them who died, the phenomenon possesses the capacity to disrupt, at times profoundly so, the emotional, psychological and spiritual equilibrium of the <b>experient.</b> Intrinsic to the phenomenon is that it can educate and inform, reorientate or realign value and belief-systems, challenge notions and understandings of the self and its systems-relationship with the universe, illuminate and feed the mind and enrich the being. The social relevance of the study findings are significant because they highlight the potential of communiqué as a means of initiating a transpersonal paradigm shift, not just at an individual level but across broader social and cultural levels as well. The phenomenon has this potential because of its interrelatedness and interdependence with the <b>experient,</b> the visible social world in which the event occurs, and the universe. Additionally, communiqué as an idea extends an invitation to consider life and one’s participation in life not just from transpersonal perspectives and understandings, but from within a systems-context of non-linear, interconnecting and interdependent relationships. The research question the study answered was: What are the natures and meanings of communiqué between bereaved adults and the person/s close to them who died? The process of answering the research question has revealed that communiqué manifests as a flux in flowing linear time. This flux constitutes an intersection of material and non-material reality between embodied and disembodied individuals. The ensuing engagement between both is not only intersubjective; it is subjectively experienced by the embodied individual in that it is seeded into the mind and being as new knowledge and new thinking...|$|E

In addition, I address classical models including electromagnetic models, energy field models, and the zero-point field model. I address the associations of psi phenomena with quantum theory, and new approaches to such phenomena via quantum mechanical modeling. Also included is an overview of fundamental quantum mechanical laws, principles, and issues in regards to psi such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, superposition, quantum computation, decoherence, entropy, information processing, wave function collapse, and the measurement problem. I elaborate on the essential role of quantum information theory in regards to psi phenomena, the view of computational living systems, the macroscopic challenge for quantum computation and psychical re-search, the quantum efficiency of psi, and the non-local communicative nature of psi. In addition, I address the part played by Nature in regards to the mediation of psi via my own hypo-thesis addressing Nature as an <b>experient</b> accessible universal information processing and storage system with features of four dimensionalism. I address geomagnetic entanglement and permanent and seemingly macroscopic entanglement in regards to psi. Importantly, I briefly call for a redefinition of precognition, that does not defy the principle of causality (arrow of time), as a result of <b>experient</b> access to Nature’s probabilistic computations in real-time (i. e. once we start to view Nature as a quantum computational system, or similar to the human brain e. g. in regards to predictive coding, we will begin to see that {{it may not be the}} “future” experients of precognition receive, but rather probability based on past and real-time events calculated by the system) ...|$|E

The contemporary view of metaphor as proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) attempts to provide a more useful and accurate account of human experience than the current objectivist explanations. In contrast to these, it emphasizes the importance of metaphor, imagination, and embodiment in our interactions with reality. This paper focuses on the metaphorical constructions employed in categorizing the phenomena investigated in parapsychology and psychical research. It is proposed that three main metaphors have been used: intrusions, transmissions/forces, and connections. These metaphors reflect the ways in which researchers, interested parties, <b>experients,</b> and laypersons have sought to structure their experiences and beliefs; as such, they provide valuabl...|$|R
