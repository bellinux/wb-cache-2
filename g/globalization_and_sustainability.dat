Sustainability, the capacity to maintain high standards of living through generations, is at stake. This paper examines the problems of sustainability with globalization from several perspectives. High statistical correlation between indices of globalization and environmental degradation (r 2 = 0. 977, p 3 ̆c. 001) is found using multi-dimensional scaling software. The socially destabilizing, culture flattening effects of globalization are examined, and the terms ‘nationalism’ and ‘terrorism’ are defined. On {{the basis of its}} medial position among the indices of both globalization and environmental degradation, Chile is explored in a case study of the interaction. Conclusions regarding Chile’s vulnerabilities are reached, and the country’s environmental, social, and economic ‘weak spots’ are identified. The ethical positions of <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability</b> are considered, and the conclusion that there is very little {{that can be done to}} alter the nature of the interaction is drawn. It is suggested that globalization minimizes the prospects of success in efforts toward sustainability by maximizing vulnerabilities among sustainability’s components...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we map {{the gendered}} {{contours}} of contemporary water management {{in order to}} demonstrate that regimes for individual ownership of water rights, markets, and the productive use of water simply reinscribe and simultaneously submerge in their apparent gender-neutrality a normative masculinity that underpins economic globalization and fortifies existing power relations. Not only do such arrangements disadvantage reproductive values and non-consumptive users; more generally, they also lack the capacity to ensure water’s sustainable development. Consequently, new management institutions for sustainability are demanded and, in making a case for equity-enhancing and adaptive institutions that better reflect water’s materiality, its multiple values and emerging water scarcity, we argue the need to invoke the conserving and ecologically protective feminine principle. To support our reasoning, we analyse water reform processes instituted in Australia and specifically by the State of Tasmania, referring to the latter jurisdiction to illustrate the gendered nature of resource management and to underscore tensions between economic <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability,</b> concluding that the tensions between the two agendas are probably irresolvable. We position our work in the borderlands among gender studies, feminist geography and philosophy, and political ecology, drawing together insights about the construction of resource management, the possibilities of the feminine care ethic, and ideas about the characteristics of institutional systems that could ensure equitable allocation and sustainable use of the planet’s resources...|$|E

The edited volume {{presents}} an engaging cartography of Indian economy following {{two decades of}} liberalization on the backdrop of <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> problem of <b>sustainability</b> - two defining moments of post-reforms reorganization of the economy. A wide variety of sector-specific and economy-wide studies in the collection, examine the central tenets of market-centric reforms representing globalization. The research works dealing with micro- and macro-aspects of development help us form an idea of important issues, emerging debates, dominant institutions and changes required for attainment/restoration of efficiency. Most of these writings indicate the limitations of current developmental logic in their specific settings. These studies also propose measures to tackle the problems faced while presuming growth-sustainability disconnect to be temporary in nature. A number of studies introduced new analytical categories and empirical frameworks to capture current reality in better and more meaningful ways. A third strand of writings portrays conflict between the project of <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> issue of <b>sustainability</b> as a distinguishing characteristic of global capitalism although the present policy framework accord highest priority to capitalist expansion. This conflict however, has put the Indian state in a perpetual act of balancing the growth objective of global capital and welfare objective meant for those experiencing exclusion in the development process [...] Keywords.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{concerning the}} evolution of the supply chain (SC) has highlighted that supply systems have undergone massive changes. The SC is a multi-objective system (economic, productive, strategic, environmental, social, etc.) crossed by a variety of flows (financial, material, information, technology, etc.). In such a complex system, the management of the processes of adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing and application of knowledge appears to be the necessary response to the new challenges posed to the SC by <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability</b> issues. This paper provides a systematic review of knowledge management (KM) in SCs in order to identify {{the state of the art}} in the literature, highlight research gaps, and define appropriate research questions to be addressed. To this end, eighty-two papers were selected and studied in detail. The paper shows that although there are a growing number of papers addressing KM in SC, many research issues are still neglected. In particular, the paper highlights eight main gaps in the SC literature. The first three gaps concern the factors affecting the adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing, and application of KM practices. The next three gaps address the systems to support knowledge management. The seventh gap considers the barriers to the adoption of KM practices. The eighth gap looks at the impact of adoption of KM practices on performance. Starting from these eight gaps, nine research questions have been formulated. These research questions represent possible areas of investigation to improve the body of knowledge in the field of KM in SC...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the relationship between economic and environmental policy, identifying fault lines and investigating solutions. The research included both theoretical and empirical components, with the theoretical analysis informing the empirical research and vice versa. The theoretical component commenced with an examination at the interface between economic <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability</b> leading to reframing economic policy towards sustainability. This foundation was used to launch a vision for a sustainable world economy and a tentative policy framework capable of facilitating it. This proposed framework is termed ‘Proximization’ and relies on acceptance that sustainability should be overarching policy. For the empirical research, aviation was chosen as the particular sector because views are highly polarized making progress towards sustainable solutions particularly challenging. The methodology developed within the research was a novel approach combining the ethos of Action Research with case study analysis. It comprised 28 in-depth stakeholder interviews across a wide range from passengers and environmentalists to people in the aviation industry and government. The case study showed that applying the different mind-set developed in the conceptual analysis leads to identifying a solution even in this most difficult sector. The key finding of the research is that setting sustainability as the overarching policy objective facilitates the emergence of transformational solutions. This proved to be applicable in aviation and has considerable potential to be applied to other sectors. For ‘proximization’ to develop from an emerging concept to reality as an alternative framework for macroeconomic policy, would require pushing back against the policies that currently enable economic globalization, so might be contentious. More research is needed to apply the Action Research Case Study approach to other areas as well as to investigate further the merits of proximization to facilitate communities, countries and regions to find pathways to sustainability that suit their geography, culture and resources...|$|E
30|$|In {{the frame}} of <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability,</b> process {{intensification}} is a path to the future chemical and process engineering. Process intensification converts “molecules into money” {{which is based on}} the premise that the chemical engineering drives today’s economy development and is fundamental to wealth creation [1]. Process intensification (PI) has been defined as “Any chemical engineering development that leads to a substantially smaller, cleaner and more energy-efficient technology” [2]. Process intensification can be achieved by using new equipment [3], or by employing different methods in previously well-known equipment. Further, the new equipment is classified as reactors and equipment for non-reactive operations, whereas the methods have been viewed as multifunctional reactors, hybrid separations [4], alternate renewable raw materials [5], alternate energy sources [6] and other methods. The main focus while exploring PI options for a given process has been continuous operation, since a shift from batch to continuous operation automatically leads to smaller and more energy-efficient operation. In this context, extensive literature has been reported over the past decade, and reactive separations in general and reactive distillation in particular have occupied one of the top slots among the PI studies reported. Harmsen [7] provided a full-scale review of commercial applications, research, scale-up, design and operation of reactive distillation, showing it to be the front runner of industrial process intensification, and stated that reactive distillation has been implemented in more than 150 commercial operations of petrochemical and chemical industry. Sharma and Mahajani [8] and Hiwale et al. [9] have provided exhaustive reviews on the industrial applications of reactive distillation covering several classes of reactions including esterification, trans-esterification, hydrolysis, etherification, hydrogenation, hydrodesulphurization, dehydrogenation, alkylation, metathesis, hydration, dehydration, carbonylation, polymerization, chlorination, amination, synthesis of carbonates, chiral separation and acetalization along with industrial examples for each class of reaction, and have pointed out some inherent limitations which can be overcome through proper choice of parameters. Taylor and Krishna [10] have provided a comprehensive review on different modeling approaches applicable for reactive distillation.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{broadband}} has been recognized in the EU as having great benefits for economic and social development. This recognition {{is evident in the}} first EU policy document on the telecommunications market – the 1987 Green Paper – which assumed that harmonization and liberalization through competition mechanisms could be used as tools to bring all those benefits to European citizens. Although the policy emphasized competition mechanisms in the years that followed, many additional instruments were developed and implemented in order to make broadband available to all European citizens. Some of the instruments {{can be seen in the}} form of directives, and some in the many policy strategies. All of them make a considerable contribution to the growth of broadband deployment in the EU. However, the importance of broadband infrastructures is furthermore elevated in the context of an emerging information society representing a fundamental transformation of social and economic structures resulting from innovation in information and communication technologies. With globalization, the policy impetus for broadband has shifted towards a means to increase the competitiveness of a nation or region. In addition, concerns of sustainability have emerged as a central issue for the long-run development of modern societies, and questions have been raised about the role of broadband in this context. This changing emphasis, due to <b>globalization,</b> competitiveness, <b>and</b> <b>sustainability,</b> impacts the design of policy instruments. A question can be raised as to which instruments can serve a new concept for future broadband policy. This thesis aims to propose a conceptual framework for broadband policy that takes into account both traditional and new aspects of telecommunications sector in an information society by observing the empirical world, and analyzing literature and empirical studies. Particularly, this thesis presents an evolutionary concept for broadband policy in the EU by providing a model for integrating the related broadband policy instruments. A timeline of all the instruments and initiatives that are being implemented is explored. This evolution is analyzed to see what kind of future model is applicable to an information society when broadband policy is based on a perspective of <b>globalization,</b> regional competitiveness, <b>and</b> <b>sustainability.</b> The analysis addresses how well the existing instruments are applicable to a new concept of broadband policy and what the needs are for a new policy framework...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{trends are}} the ever growing {{competition}} with increased <b>globalization</b> <b>and</b> <b>sustainability.</b> Together with ongoing technological developments {{and the demand}} for right quality of products and services, this has also resulted in increased demands for legislation and traceability. This development has also had an impact on packaging and Packaging Logistics. This thesis deals with packaging, logistics and performance when packaging interacts with users and seeks to find answers to the research question: How can a systematic and holistic approach to packaging increase the logistics performance to create efficiency and effectiveness? The purpose of this work is to increase knowledge regarding packaging and its interacting role with agents in the Supply-Demand Chain in order to improve, and to increase knowledge in the area of Packaging Logistics Performance. Performance in Packaging Logistics is about doing the right thing and doing things right, as well as position products and services relative to its competitor. A model has been created to increase knowledge of Packaging Logistics Performance, which covers interaction between the packaging system and its users. This model also includes the tool 'Packaging Scorecard' that measures Packaging Logistics Performance and shows the packaging related deficiencies that exist in various levels of the Supply-Demand Chain. Furthermore, the tool has been developed to enable efficient product development. The developed model will provide support for the development of packaging strategies to change existing systems or develop new systems. The strategies also take into account the agents involved by demonstrating the requirements on the packaging and how small changes in the packaging system may contribute to a significant improvement in the Supply-Demand Chain. New functions and roles for companies operating in the various logistics processes were identified. The research has for example identified a new type of service, the Network Integrator. This function was also identified in the packaging area and this agent was named the Packaging Integrator. To increase understanding of the Supply-Demand Chain, the tool CATWOE (Customer, Agents, Transformation processes, World view, Owners and Environment) was applied. This tool was further developed to adapt Packaging Logistics Performance and complexity theory. The general methodology for this thesis was action-based research and case studies. The developed model illustrates packaging systems and how they perform in order to create conditions for better and more efficient performance. Further the thesis explores and presents ways to improve performance and integration. The theoretical contribution is to demonstrate a knowledge of packaging systems, and an understanding the interactive roles and existing requirements in the Supply-Demand Chain. Practical contributions are the valuable empirical knowledge and increased understanding of packaging requirements and their interactions with agent to create conditions for effectiveness, efficiency and differentiation...|$|E
