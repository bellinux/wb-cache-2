5|$|Most border {{units were}} based in forts as were their predecessors, the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were based in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) were based in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E

We proposed operators of GA to solve this problem effectively. Basing on the extensive computational testing, the appropriate values for the various parameters associated with this genetic algorithm are found. Experiments show results are stable with different runs and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>case</b> <b>they</b> reach the optimal solution. I...|$|R

25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{that requires}} superpolynomial time lies outside the complexity class P. Cobham's thesis posits that these algorithms are impractical, and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> are.

50|$|After the {{independence}} of Brazil in 1822, a Brazilian heraldry appeared, which continued the Portuguese tradition in most of its aspects. Regarding family heraldry, {{as most of the}} noble families of Brazil descended from Portuguese lineages, <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cased</b> <b>they</b> continued to bear their coats of arms. The Portuguese tradition of civic heraldry was also partially followed in Brazil. In the 20th century, the Portuguese municipal heraldry official standards established in 1930 served as the model for the municipal heraldry of Brazil. Many Brazilian municipalities created new coats of arms or adapted their old ones to such standards.|$|R

25|$|The first {{official}} dawn service {{was held at}} the Sydney Cenotaph in 1927. Dawn services were originally very simple and followed the operational ritual; <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were restricted to veterans only. The daytime ceremony was for families and other well-wishers and the dawn service was for returned soldiers to remember and reflect among the comrades with whom they shared a special bond.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} streets run diagonally through Chicago's {{grid system}} on {{all or part}} of their courses. These streets tend to form major 5 or 6-way intersections. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were Indian trails, or were among the earliest streets established in the city. Diagonals are numbered as north-south or east-west streets. Examples are North Lincoln Avenue and Ogden Avenue, which bends at Madison and changes from North Ogden to West Ogden.|$|E
50|$|Improvement commissioners were {{gradually}} {{superseded by}} reformed municipal boroughs (from 1835) and boards of health (from 1848), which absorbed commissioners' powers by promoting private acts.

60|$|Their back pieces now {{served the}} troopers in good stead, as did their {{superior}} personal strength.

25|$|Taxis {{are mostly}} {{informal}} and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary {{in size from}} small four-door compacts to large vans.

Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.|$|E
25|$|Leyendecker was a chief {{influence}} upon, {{and friend}} of, Norman Rockwell, {{who was a}} pallbearer at Leyendecker's funeral. In particular, the early work of Norman Rockwell for the Saturday Evening Post bears a strong superficial resemblance to that of Leyendecker. While today it is generally accepted that Norman Rockwell established the best-known visual images of Americana, <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> are derivative of Leyendecker's work, or reinterpretations of visual themes established by Rockwell's idol.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to cases of sodomy, oral penetration, and lewd and sexual acts against a minor, {{cases have been}} brought forth against members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> deliberately moved sexually abusive priests to other locations where the clergy continued their acts of sexual aggression towards minors. – {{this has led to}} a number of fraud cases in the United States, where the Church has been accused of misleading victims by deliberately relocating priests accused of abuse instead of removing them from their positions.|$|E

25|$|On many lines, the new {{units were}} warmly welcomed. It is {{important}} to remember that while the first generation DMUs had given many years of service, <b>in</b> very <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>they</b> suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, the mere fact that the trains were clean and new was enough to make them welcome countrywide.|$|R
60|$|As usual, the Soudanese {{troops had}} been {{accompanied}} by {{a considerable number of}} their wives, who were heavily laden with their little household goods, and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> babies. <b>They</b> trudged patiently along {{in the rear of the}} columns, and formed an encampment of their own, half a mile away from the men's, generally selecting a piece of ground surrounded by thick bush, into which they could escape, should Dervish raiders come down upon them.|$|R
25|$|When {{printed books}} on the occult, {{particularly}} in the English language, had begun to be produced, some cunning folk obtained, and used, grimoires, or books of magic. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> made a big show {{of the fact that}} they owned such tomes, which would have appeared impressive in the minds of many of their customers in a period where only a minority of people were able to read and write in Britain. Indeed, some cunning folk appeared to own these grimoires purely for cosmetic reasons, to impress their clients, and did not actually make use of any of the magical rituals contained within them.|$|E
25|$|The {{continental}} {{system of}} guilds and merchants arrived in England after the Norman Conquest, with incorporated societies of merchants in each town or city holding exclusive rights {{of doing business}} there. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> became the governing body of a town. For example, London's Guildhall became {{the seat of the}} Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation, the world’s oldest continuously elected local government whose members to this day must be Freemen of the City. The Freedom of the City, effective from the Middle Ages until 1835, gave the right to trade, and was only bestowed upon members of a Guild or Livery.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
50|$|Former constellations are constellations {{that are}} no longer {{recognized}} by the International Astronomical Union for various reasons.

25|$|That being said, many Italian volunteers {{take their}} {{commitment}} very seriously, and participate <b>in</b> <b>many</b> hours of uncompensated training; {{this is particularly}} true for well-organized volunteer groups. These individuals still require support from a physician and nurse for ALS provision. While there are some ALS ambulances in Italy, they are typically not found outside larger centers, and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> where <b>they</b> do exist, they are frequently required to have the 'emergency' physician present to perform ICU skills, in a manner very similar to the other neighbouring countries.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{classification}} involved {{being examined}} in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles {{with their hands}} and with pins. The system had no built in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not insured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. In the early Paralympic Games, this class would have been ineligible to participate <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> because <b>they</b> did not meet minimum disability requirements set by the ISMGF.|$|R
25|$|The Prado Bridge {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{important}} points in the geographic landscape of the medieval territory of Entre-Douro-e-Minho. Its appearance reflects various reconstructions that occurred during the Middle Ages and modern eras, supporting its importance along the centuries. During the Middle Ages, the Roman roads continued to be used (and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> were the only access between points in existence). Within this context, the Prado Bridge was the object of attention. Between the religious center of Braga and one of the oldest towns in the country (Ponte de Lima), the Prado continued to link the north and southern territories. A legend persists that the Leonese king, in order to rendezvous with a maiden he was enamoured with, ordered that the bridge be maintained and its statute reinforced during the medieval period.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 12 August 2002, Scillonian III {{could not}} sail {{because of a}} {{technical}} fault, leaving hundreds of tourists temporarily stranded on St Mary's. The ferry had to remain docked in Penzance while engineers worked on the fault. Travellers booked in for the sailing were advised to make alternative arrangements; however British International and Skybus services struggled {{to cope with the}} massive extra demand for seats, the problem made worse by one of British International’s two helicopters being grounded. Cancellation of Scillonian IIIs sailing mainly affected day trip passengers to Scilly and visitors staying in guesthouses, as <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> could not be re-accommodated in the same guesthouse. Freight services to St Mary's were also disrupted by the cancellation, so Gry Maritha had to make a re-scheduled Monday night sailing to deliver fruit and vegetables to the Isles of Scilly.|$|E
25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> <b>they</b> continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air {{in order to get to}} their meeting points.|$|E
40|$|Irish journalism {{developed}} during the 19 th century {{at a time of}} tremendous change. While journalists were involved in the debates about nationalism, both as commentators and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> activists, <b>they</b> also developed a journalism practice that corresponded to the professional norms of journalists in Britain and the United States. It would appear that the middle-class nature of Irish journalists meant there was a dual pressure towards professionalising journalism and fighting for legislative independence.
