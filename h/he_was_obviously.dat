He may have come from Townhead of Lambroughton, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a man with strong local connections.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Abalabandhab, Dwarkanath {{raised a}} storm within the Brahmo Samaj {{regarding}} {{the issue of}} women sitting behind the screen during prayer meetings. With his strong reformist views, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> opposed {{to many of the}} conservative ideas not only in society but even in the Brahmo Samaj. That {{was the beginning of the}} split in the Brahmo Samaj of India, which ultimately led to the formation of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. Ganguly served several terms as secretary of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the date}} and the {{circumstances}} of Raymond's release are uncertain. According to William of Tyre, Raymond was set free after spending eight (solar) years in captivity, but Ibn Jubayr stated that Raymond had been held in prison for twelve (lunar) years. Ali ibn al-Athir recorded that Raymond was released after Nur ad-Din died on 15 May 1174, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> wrong, because Raymond had witnessed a royal charter in Jerusalem already on 18 April 1174. On the other hand, according to Lewis, Ali ibn al-Athir may have been right when claiming that Raymond was released because of the emerging conflict between Nur ad-Din's family and his ambitious commander, Saladin.|$|E

25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> playing with his opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E
500|$|To {{justify his}} {{presence}} at the squash court, Jim {{claims to be a}} regular player and begins a match with Robert, demonstrating his complete lack of skill at squash and resulting in multiple injuries. He makes an unsuccessful attempt to access Robert's email from his phone, and finally resorts to trying to [...] "accidentally" [...] break his phone. However, when Robert checks his messages after 5:00, the e-mail has not come through. Realizing that Dwight must have stopped the device, Jim admits that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> lying about being a squash player and prepares to leave, but Robert, apparently oblivious to Jim's statements, makes him stay and continue playing.|$|E
500|$|The {{ambulance}} crew {{left the}} hotel at approximately 11:35a.m. to take Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital and {{they arrived at}} 11:45a.m. Medical registrar Dr. Martin Seifert stated: [...] "Jimi was rushed into the [...] room. He was put on a monitor, but it [...] was flat. I pounded his heart [...] a couple of times, {{but there was no}} point, he was dead". According to Seifert, the attempt to resuscitate Hendrix lasted [...] "just a few minutes". The surgical registrar, Dr. John Bannister, commented: [...] "He was cold and he was blue. He had all the parameters of someone who had been dead for some time. We worked on him for about half an hour without any response at all." [...] Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: [...] "On admission <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 November 1604 Cobergher was {{appointed}} by the archdukes to the post of [...] "architecte et ingeniaire" [...] (architect-engineer). He moved to his final address in the Violetstreet in Brussels, where he would remain till his death. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> more appreciated by the archdukes than were the court painters Peter Paul Rubens or Jan Brueghel the Elder, since his salary amounted to 1500 guilders (increasing to 1800 guilders in 1610), while Rubens' salary was only 500 guilders. The archdukes rightly considered him [...] as an [...] "uomo universale" [...] (universal man) who had received a wide knowledge in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Faith No More {{lead singer}} Mike Patton also showed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> miming a {{performance}} by sticking his tongue {{out of the side}} of his mouth during close-up shots. Also, their 1997 performance of [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] on the show featured Robin Guy (of the band Sack Trick) on drums instead of their actual drummer. He apparently wore a [...] "Puffy" [...] mask as a joke in reference to Faith No More's actual drummer, Mike [...] "Puffy" [...] Bordin. Mike Patton can be seen giving Guy the finger during the performance, supposedly because the mask fell off (or was taken off on purpose) as soon as the performance started.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{was still}} unpopular among many Conservatives and the Establishment, who opposed his {{replacing}} Chamberlain; {{the former prime}} minister remained party leader until dying in November. Churchill probably could not have won a majority in any of the political parties in the House of Commons, and the House of Lords was completely silent when it learned of his appointment. An American visitor reported in late 1940 that, [...] "Everywhere I went in London people admired [...] energy, his courage, his singleness of purpose. People said they didn't know what Britain would do without him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> respected. But no one felt he would be Prime Minister after the war. He was simply the right man in the right job at the right time. The time being the time of a desperate war with Britain's enemies." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} factors worked against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed {{management}} in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror B-film unit, at times in small roles where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> used for [...] "name value" [...] only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine, Sol Lesser, and Sam Katzman. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors' Fund to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|After the Mexican-American War (ending in 1848), {{he served}} as {{assistant}} adjutant general of the Pacific Division, but resigned his commission in 1853; his military reputation had been damaged when he testified against his former commander, General Scott, in the court-martial for insubordination of Gideon Johnson Pillow. Hooker settled in Sonoma County, California, as a farmer and land developer, but was more devoted to gambling and liquor than to agriculture. His house still exists {{in the city of}} Sonoma. When living in Sonoma, he stood unsuccessfully for election to represent the region in the California legislature. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because, in 1858, he wrote to Secretary of War John B. Floyd to request that his name [...] "be presented to the president Buchanan as a candidate for a lieutenant colonelcy", but nothing came of his request. From 1859 to 1861, he held a commission as a colonel in the California militia.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the first}} week of Foster's {{employment}} came to an end, rumors swirled that he would be denied union membership on grounds that he did not work for seven days (his makework did not count) and because he had not completed the union's required four-year apprenticeship program. UFM officials said any refusal of Foster's application [...] "dishonors our agreement", and pickets were again threatened. Local 65 leaders proposed that Foster be admitted as fourth-year apprentice and at 90 percent pay. At a two-and-a-half hour union membership meeting on August 14, Foster's application for membership was rejected. Union officers agreed that Foster's application was in order and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> qualified, but that no further action could be taken until a regularly scheduled union executive board meeting on August 28. Foster attempted to obtain a temporary work card from the union, but union offices were inexplicably closed each time he went there. Lacking a union card, Foster was laid off on August 15. Despite the previous day's statements by union leaders, a union business agent declared on August 15 that Foster had to follow the standard four-year apprentice process before he could join the union. The earliest his application for apprentice could be accepted was the middle of September. This outraged the UFM, which said it would begin picketing and refused to meet with representatives from city hall.|$|E
2500|$|Khrushchev often {{claimed to}} possess a vast arsenal of nuclear-tipped ICBMs, and while disclaiming any {{intention}} of starting a war, maintained {{that he would be}} more than happy to turn a conventional war into a nuclear one if war did come. The U-2 spy flights, which were intended to discover if the Soviet Union really did have the nuclear arsenal that it claimed to have, only started in July 1956, and it was not until February 1959 that it firmly established that Khrushchev had vastly exaggerated his nuclear strength. In fact, the supposedly huge Soviet arsenal of ICBMs, with which Khrushchev would wipe out the cities of Britain, France, Israel, and if necessary the United States consisted only of four Semyorka missiles stationed at a swamp south of Arkhangelsk. From the viewpoint of Eisenhower, in 1956 he had no way of knowing for certain whether Khrushchev's nuclear braggadocio was for real or not. Earlier in 1956, Dulles had warned Eisenhower that Khrushchev was [...] "the most dangerous person to lead the Soviet Union since the October Revolution" [...] as Khrushchev was [...] "not a coldly calculating person, but rather one who reacted emotionally. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> intoxicated much of the time and could be expected to commit irrational acts." [...] Khrushchev later admitted in his memoirs that he was not seriously [...] "thinking of going to war" [...] in November 1956 as he claimed at the time as he lacked the necessary ICBMs to make good his threats.|$|E
