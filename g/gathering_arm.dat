Qian Yuanguan took an opportunity, when Qian Yuanxu was in the palace for a feast, to kill both him and Qian Yuanxiang. However, when he then further considered punishing officials who were close associates of Qian Yuanxu and Qian Yuanxiang, Qian Renjun urged him to be lenient, and he agreed.|$|R

The impact of communist campaigning against the treaty left its mark in Burma's decision not to join the British Commonwealth.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 104 - 105) The partisan {{movement in}} the Soviet Union during World War II began almost immediately after the German invasion because the occupiers treated the Soviet citizens brutally. The citizens responded by <b>gathering</b> <b>arms</b> and banding together to try and defeat their enemy. In the beginning they operated on their own initiative and carried out missions in the German rear. They gathered intelligence information about supply routes and schedules, and they attacked German supply convoys, trains, and German police stations. They also killed Nazi collaborators. Additionally, Stalin ordered Russian army soldiers who had been cut off from their military units to form partisan units. Then, to increase partisan successes {{and to keep the}} partisans from turning against the Soviet Union, Party members and military personnel who had been trained in sabotage and espionage activities were sent to partisan units. By 1943, the partisans were organized under Soviet leadership and operating like a branch of the military. To keep them adequately supplied for the war, artillery was flown to partisan guarded airstrips. The partisans prevented supplies and manpower from reaching the Germans, supplied the Soviet military with essential intelligence information about German planned operations, partnered with the Soviet military on some of their offensive operations and retook areas that were being controlled by German administrators. Approximately 500, 000 people worked as partisans during the war in the Soviet Union, and approximately the same number of Germans and their allies died in partisan controlled areas in the Soviet Union during WWII...|$|R

Worcester itself had no particular claim to being loyal to the King. Throughout the First Civil War it had taken the pragmatic position of declaring loyalty to whichever side had been in occupation! The epithet 'Faithful City' arose out of a cynical (and unsuccessful) claim at the Restoration for compensation from the new king.|$|R

She was married to Polycaon, son of king Lelex, of Laconia. Messene was said to have been very ambitious. After her father-in-law died, her husband's brother Myles inherited the throne to Laconia. It was not her intent to be wed to an anonymous man, so she went about <b>gathering</b> an <b>armed</b> force from both Argos and Laconia. Once their army was ready, the newly married couple invaded a nearby territory. This territory was then named Messenia, after the aggressive princess of Argos. Following the establishment of the new kingdom, they founded the city Andania, where they built their palace. Glaucus, the son of Aepytus and grandson of Cresphontes, established a hero cult of Messene. There was a heroon of her in Messenia with a statue of gold and Parian marble.
