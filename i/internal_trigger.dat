50|$|A {{crossbow}} is a bow {{mounted on}} a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it that holds the drawn bow string. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up {{through a hole in}} the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or tickler. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a nut to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal sear or trigger face, usually of metal. These roller nuts were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or {{mounted on a}} metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal. Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{carriers}} {{for drug}} and gene delivery {{have been successfully}} used in clinical applications, and developing to achieve greater efficacy. A successful polymeric carrier must not only protect the therapeutics from degradation but also increase the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties of the therapeutic agents. Furthermore, releasing the therapeutic agents from nanocarriers at the desired target sites and with the correct dosage is important to enhance patient outcomes. Numerous polymeric systems for drug and gene delivery that can release bioactive agents through response to external (e. g., light, electric or magnetic source, and ultrasound) or <b>internal</b> <b>triggers</b> (e. g., pH, enzyme, and redox) have been designed. However, release mechanism using these triggers is restrictive in terms of in vivo applications as there is limited accessibility of external stimuli to tissues or organs; and the efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>triggers</b> are variable between cell lines and even within the same tissue or organ. Some carriers are not degradable, raising the important issue of toxicity due to accumulation {{in the body and}} healthy cells. In addition, the time of release is mostly uncontrollable.

40|$|We re-examine whether substorms are {{triggered}} by solar wind fluctuations or an internal magnetospheric instability {{by comparing the}} statistical associations between substorm onsets and (1) an external trigger definition, (2) a simple <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> definition of only prior loading of solar wind energy that is {{a subset of the}} external trigger definition. Statistical associations are calculated both for observed substorm onsets and onsets generated by a Minimal Substorm Model in which substorms are purely internally triggered.

40|$|A plastic {{root system}} is a {{prerequisite}} for successful plant acclimation to variable environments. The normally functioning root system {{is the result of a}} complex interaction of root-borne signals and shoot-derived regulators. We recently demonstrated that AUX 1, a well-studied component of auxin transport, mediates shoot-supplied ammonium (SSA) inhibition of lateral root (LR) formation in Arabidopsis. By contrast, the response did not involve ABA pathways, via which several other abiotic stresses affect LR formation. We proposed that SSA regulates LR emergence by interrupting AUX 1 -mediated auxin transport from shoot to root. Here, by analyzing both ABA- and auxin-related mutants, we show that AUX 1 is also required for SSA-mediated suppression of primary root growth. Ammonium content in shoots was furthermore shown to increase linearly with shoot-, but not root-supplied, ammonium, suggesting it may represent the <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> for SSA inhibition of root development. Taken together, our data identify AUX 1 -mediated auxin transport as a key transmission step in the sensing of excessive ammonium exposure and its inhibitory effect on root development...|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{responses}} to sensory stimuli or neuronal responses related to behaviour are often extracted by averaging neuronal activity over {{large number of}} experimental trials. Such trial-averaging is carried out to reduce noise and to reduce the influence of other signals unrelated to the corresponding stimulus or behaviour. However, if the recorded neuronal responses are jittered in time {{with respect to the}} corresponding stimulus or behaviour, averaging over trials may distort the estimation of the underlying neuronal response. Here, we present an algorithm, named dTAV algorithm, for realigning the recorded neuronal activity to an arbitrary <b>internal</b> <b>trigger.</b> Using simulated data, we show that the dTAV algorithm can reduce the jitter of neuronal responses for signal to noise ratios of 0. 2 or higher, i. e. in cases where the standard deviation of the noise is up to five times larger than the neuronal response amplitude. By removing the jitter and, therefore, enabling more accurate estimation of neuronal responses, the dTAV algorithm can improve analysis and interpretation of the responses and improve the accuracy of systems relaying on asynchronous detection of events from neuronal recordings...|$|E

The goal was to measure the energy loss by charge readout in addition to drift time measurement. Due to the irregular cluster structure of the straw signals complex algorithms for pulse finding, pulse feature extraction and triggering were implemented. The algorithm can detect pile up and find pulse groups. Integration is possible over single pulses and over complete groups.

40|$|Abstract. Neuronal {{activity}} in the mammalian cortex exhibits {{a considerable amount of}} trial-by-trial variabil-ity. This may be reflected by the magnitude of the activity {{as well as by the}} response latency with respect to an external event, such as the onset of a sensory stimulus, or a behavioral event. Here we present a novel nonparametric method for estimating trial-by-trial dif-ferences in response latency from neuronal spike trains. The method makes use of the dynamic rate profile for each single trial and maximizes their total pairwise correlation by appropriately shifting all trials in time. The result is a new alignment of trials that largely eliminates the variability in response latency and provides a new <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> that is independent of experiment time. To calibrate the method, we simulated spike trains based on stochastic point processes using a parametric model for phasic response profiles. We illustrate the method by an application to simultaneous recordings from a pair of neurons in the motor cortex of a behaving monkey. It is demonstrated how the method can be used to study the temporal relation of the neuronal response to the experiment, to investigate whether neurons share the same dynamics, and to improve spike correlation analysis. Differences between this and other, previously published methods are discussed. ...|$|E

Previous studies have typically utilised an <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> to initiate reconnection, e. g. initial conditions centred on the current sheet. Numerical simulations solving the compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations were performed to {{investigate the}} reconnection onset within different atmospheric layers of the Sun, namely the corona, chromosphere and photosphere. A reconnecting state is reached for all atmospheric heights considered, with the dominant physics being highly dependent on atmospheric conditions. The coronal case achieves a sharp rise in electric field {{for a range of}} velocity drivers. For the chromosphere, we find a larger velocity amplitude is required to trigger reconnection. For the photospheric environment, the electric field is highly dependent on the inflow speed; a sharp increase in electric field is obtained only as the velocity entering the reconnection region approaches the Alfven speed. Additionally, the role of ambipolar diffusion is investigated for the chromospheric case and we find that the ambipolar diffusion alters the structure of the current density in the inflow region. The rate at which flux enters the reconnection region is controlled by the inflow velocity. This determines all aspects of the reconnection start-up process, i. e. the early onset of reconnection is dominated by the advection term in Ohms law in all atmospheric layers. A lower plasma-β enhances reconnection and creates a large change in the electric field. A high plasma-β hinders the reconnection, yielding a sharp rise in the electric field only when the velocity flowing into the reconnection region approaches the local Alfven speed...|$|E

This was a survey of benchmarking practices in higher education in Kenya, the case of public universities, whose objectives were; to document the benchmarking activities in the public universities; to establish the challenges facing the public universities in benchmarking. Cross sectional survey was used in this study to collect data from the six public universities with their respective campuses/schools in the population of interest. The respondents were senior administrators and the academic staff. Of the 53 informants who were sampled, 31 responded, thus, a response rate was of 58 percent. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and summarize the data before presenting it in the form of proportions, means, tables and graphs. This was in line with the first and second objectives, which were actually answered in relation to the benchmarking practices in the academic function of public universities in Kenya. The study found out that continuous improvement systems in Kenyan public universities are good, not excellent. The external drivers of change/continuous improvements in public universities are the customers/students as opposed to legislation, while the major <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> of change is the actual performance. The public universities effectively and successfully benchmark for continuous improvement.

The spontaneous electrical activity in ganglia was characterized by the occurrence of irregular bursts of spikes with variable duration and size. Properties of these bursts were modified by synaptic inputs arriving from the neighboring ganglia and from the two primitive brains located in the head and tail.

The accelerator comprises six modules in parallel, each of which has eight series 0. 8 -MA LTD cavities in a voltage-adder configuration. Vacuum transmission lines are used from the interior of the adder to the central vacuum chamber where the load is placed. Thus the traditional stack-flashover problem is eliminated. The machine is 3. 2  m tall and 12  m in outer diameter including supports. A prototype cavity was built and tested for more than 6000 shots intermittently at a repetition rate of 0. 1  Hz.

40|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} structures crop {{out in the}} Upper Cretaceous carbonate succession in Porto Selvaggio cove in {{the western}} Salento peninsula, Apulian foreland, southern Italy. The deformed interval is about 13 m thick and occurs between shallow-water limestones and dolostones formed in peritidal and shallow subtidal environments. It comprises well-bedded grey mudstones interlayered with dark grey laminated microbioclastic wackestones characterized by couplets of closely spaced dark and bright laminae marked by the parallel orientation of calcareous microbioclasts and thin-shelled bivalves. The low biological diversity, scarcity of burrowing biota, and presence of a well preserved fish fauna provide evidence of anoxic conditions occurring in morphological depressions within the platform, and a stagnant, stratified water body affected by weak bottom currents, indicating the sudden development of a localised and short-lived intraplatform basin. Two soft-sediment deformation horizons (slump sheets) separated by undeformed limestones with similar facies occur {{in this part of}} the succession. The lower, thicker slump sheet (1. 0 – 1. 3 m thick) contains asymmetric and box folds. Well-developed décollement surfaces (locally containing thick brecciated zones) cut the folds, forming small-scale thrust-sheets and indicating mixed plastic to brittle behaviour. The upper, thinner slump sheet (0. 25 – 0. 35 m thick) contains only asymmetric folds, indicating plastic behaviour only. The differences in deformation style are attributed to differences in facies. Measurements of fold-axis orientations in the slump sheets show that they moved in similar directions, recording the development of a local, gently dipping palaeoslope. Autogenic (<b>internal)</b> <b>trigger</b> mechanisms are ruled out by a detailed consideration of facies. The slump sheets were triggered by allogenic, tectonic effects, either the weakening of sediment by seismic activity or the tectonically induced steepening of slopes, or a combination of both. Tectonically induced steepening is consistent with localised and sudden vertical facies changes related to the creation of an intraplatform basin.
