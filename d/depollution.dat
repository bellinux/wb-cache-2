40|$|Venting {{is one of}} {{the most}} used in situ {{remediation}} methods for unsaturated soils contaiminated with volatile organic compounds (VOC). The development of mathematical models and their validation by means of experimental results allowed the identification of the main parameters which influence the soil <b>depollution</b> process. The influence of temperature on the venting <b>depollution</b> process of soils polluted with volatile organic compounds was studied in this investigation. It was found that the <b>depollution</b> efficiency is strongly influenced by the vapour pressuree of the pollutants. The conclusions, derived from the performed experimental determinations allowed characterization of the <b>depollution</b> process by using an "equilibrium" model. This model considers the existence of equilibrium between the four pollution phases (vapour, aqueous, "solid" and non-aqueous phase organic liquids) at any moment in time. In order to calculate the vapour pressure, a modified equation of the Antoine model was used in the model. Application of the mathematical model indicates that a 10 °C temperature rise leads to a two-fold increase in the vapor pressure of a compound. Comparison of the modeled and experimental curves, as well as the values of the obtained performance critterions, verified that the chosen mathematical model describes the influence of temperature on the <b>depollution</b> process very well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis short review {{presents}} some deficiencies regarding photocatalysis {{used for}} water and air <b>depollution,</b> because the environmental risks {{have to be considered}} in order to minimize negative effects of the future applications. Since photocatalysis was discovered a couple of decades ago, it was intensively studied and many applications were developed. In the environmental engineering <b>depollution</b> ex-situ and in-situ of water and air, using photocatalysis, seems to be revolutionary. Deficiencies of these processes are concerning in formation of undesirable secondary products. Some of the processes involving photocatalysis could degrade efficient by-products, but there are situations when these products seem to be more toxic than initially pollutant. One of these cases, phosgene generation during air <b>depollution,</b> is detailed in a scenario, using related researches and simple calculus.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overlapping generations model of environmental externalities with a <b>depollution</b> technology. Each agent {{concerned by the}} environmental degradation can voluntarily contribute {{in order to reduce}} it. Contributing to the environmental quality means financing <b>depollution</b> activities and uncertainty concerns its efficiency since it's not always clear or certain what effects will result from a reduction of pollution. We show that if an agent is su#ciently risk averse, voluntary contribution is a decreasing function of average efficiency of <b>depollution</b> technology. If on the contrary, the substitution e#ect is weaker than the pollution e#ect, the opposite holds. We show that precaution about environmental quality has two possible consequencies which depend on agent risk aversion. Therefore, understanding the implication of precautionary attitude, leads us to the consideration of the agents' risk aversion characterization and studying the e#ect of an increase in risk aversion implies a knowledge on prudent attitude. So, we have to conclude that precaution and risk aversion are two complementary and indissociable concepts...|$|E

40|$|The {{deregulation}} movement {{affecting the}} industrialized countries forced the governments to refocus their prescribed standards.

Furthermore, we will evaluate {{the pros and cons of}} using this system in the public administration. The subject of this research is mainly based on the <b>depollution</b> attestation adopted in 1988 by the Assemblee Nationale du Quebec to oversee industrial wastes.

40|$|International audienceAbstractTo understand, {{evaluate}} and finely predict the spatiotemporal pollutants evolution in environments, under natural attenuation or remediation (by bio- or chemical treatment), {{it is necessary}} to resort to: i) geophysical, physico-chemical and biological measurements on site, ii) laboratory treatability experiments, and iii) numerical models. In practice, that results in the use of parameters and/or empirical models for modeling on the scale of an actual site. This use permits to reproduce the controlled tests in laboratory or on site, which are used then as validation tests. However, their use for predictive calculations is problematic for the tests, where it is impossible to sweep the whole of conditions and couplings met in the system of interest. Within the framework of a predictive model, the improvement or invalidation of the empirical parameters/models must thus be done on the basis of comprehension of the subjacent mechanisms and their mutual interactions. With this purpose, {{it is necessary to}} have recourse to mechanistic and multi-scale approaches with uncertainties estimate, which makes it possible to choose in a reasoned way the dominating mechanisms and their simplified exemplification. MULTISCALEXPER project has as a principal objective to develop actions of multi-scale experimentation, utilizing numerical modeling on all the levels (from dimensioning to the interpretation of the results). These actions will be carried out using numerical tools and multi-scale pilots. More particularly, {{it is a question of}} defining a dimensioning methodology for multi-scale experiments, based on numerical approaches. This project aims at reinforcing the <b>depollution</b> techniques on: i) the small scales in order to be able to interact with academic laboratories, working at increasingly smaller scale, and especially ii) the great scales in order to be able to interact with <b>depollution</b> firms, directed in the reverse way of increasingly large scale as fast as possible. The first deliverable of the project was the critical analysis of about 15 BRGM collaborative projects, carried out in the <b>depollution</b> domain both of organic and inorganic pollutants. The projects were evaluated on the basis of a grid of techno-economic criteria and compared to the scale imitated, according to two approaches: 1) multi-scale experimentation (from a molecular scale to that of an actual site), in batch, column, plurimetric pilot, in situ demonstration, partial or total <b>depollution</b> of a site and 2) multi-scale numerical modeling. The advantages, disadvantages, redundancies and failures concerning each approach and scale were highlighted. It results very rich issues from it, showing that only scientific and technical knowledge were not enough to solve complex problems. In a way much more pragmatic, it is shown that it is necessary to innovate in approaches and scales. In particular, in porous media, the feasibility of an integrated approach on a precise <b>depollution</b> subject depends on the pollutant behavior characterization and treatability on a large scale. The work, in different media and contexts, will have to be organized to cover all the stages allowing pollutants treatability by controlled, reasoned and pragmatic implementation of the methods and scales.
