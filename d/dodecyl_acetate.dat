40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of the strongly interacting anionic/zwitterionic surfactant {{mixture of}} {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) and <b>dodecyl</b> dimethylamino <b>acetate</b> (C 12 betaine) have been studied by means of surface tension and neutron reflection. The mixed critical micelle concentrations (cmc) were used to derive the interaction parameter βM for micellization, which {{was found to be}} large and negative. It was also found to be composition dependent and therefore not to obey the first-order approximation for the activity coefficients in the pseudo-phase separation approximation. The temperature dependence of the mixed cmc gave the thermodynamic excess functions for micellization; SE was found to be positive over most of the composition range. Application of the pseudo-phase separation model to surface tension data was used to show that the interaction parameter βσ in the surface layer is similarly large and negative. However, direct measurement of the surface concentrations using neutron reflection disagree with the predictions of the pseudo-phase separation model and indicate that βσ although negative, is much smaller in magnitude. The structure of the mixed layer was determined at three compositions and found to be significantly dehydrated in comparison with layers of the single surfactants, which may explain the positive excess entropies observed for both micellization and surface mixing. It is also suggested that changes of hydration on mixing invalidate the use of the pseudo-phase separation model and may be responsible for the deviations from the first-order model observed for both micellization and surface interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} behaviour {{of several}} surfactant mixtures containing zwitterionic surfactants {{has been studied}} employing surface tension measurements and neutron reflection experiments. The mixing of surfactants at airâliquid interface could not be well understood using the pesudophase approximation and the regular solution model. By introducing the expansion of excess free energy to analysis the surface tension and neutron reflection data simultaneously, {{it is found that}} the mixing deviates strongly from ideal and the excess free energy is asymmetric. It is observed that the presence of ionic surfactant at solidâliquid interface enhanced the adsorption of zwitterionic surfactants. The configuration of the surfactant molecule in the inner layer adjacent to the surface is invoked to explain the underlying mechanism. Maxima in the adsorption just above the CMC occurred at all three compositions studied for the mixed system SDS with dodecyl dimethylammonium propanesulfonate (DSB). The neutron reflection experiments suggest that the phenomenon may result in part from the mixture and in part from ion segregation in the micelles. Structural studies on a series of <b>dodecyl</b> dimethylammonium <b>acetate</b> with different interâcharge spacer revealed that the configuration of the surfactants changes dramatically as the headgroup gets larger. Combined with the higher pKa value, it is highly possible that the carboxybetaine with longer spacer is adsorbed in its undissociated form, and the headgroup is oriented towards the air. This configuration might explain why the saturated monolayer structure is favoured over the micellization. </p...|$|R
40|$|Numerous organic {{reagents}} {{of diverse}} structural composition {{are employed in}} the froth flotation process for the beneficiation of non-metallic and sulphide ores. Alkyl xanthates are used as collectors for sulphide ores while amines and fatty acids are used for non-metallic ore beneficiation. Although these collector reagents react preferentially with the concerned minerals in the treated ore pulp, excess and unreacted concentration of these organic collectors {{end up in the}} mill process effluents. It has been known that even small concentrations of these organic reagents in water streams are toxic to water life, besides their deleterious influence on end stream processes during recycling. Bioremediation has long been recognised as an inexpensive, flexible and environmentally benign technique for waste water treatment. These organic flotation reagents are amenable to biological degradation. The major objective of this work is the degradation of solubilized collector reagents from aqueous solutions using a microbial technique. Bacillus polymyxa, a Gram-positive, neutrophilic, periflagellated heterotroph that occurs indigenously in soils and certain mineral deposits has been used in the bioremediation studies. Organic flotation reagents namely, <b>dodecyl</b> ammonium <b>acetate</b> (DAA), which is used as a collector for oxides and silicates, sodium isopropylxanthate which finds application in sulphide flotation and sodium oleate, mainly used for oxide and salt-type minerals, have been chosen for the degradation studies. Pure minerals of galena, pyrite, magnetite, quartz and calcite have been typically selected for these investigations. The growth of Bacillus polymyxa {{in the presence of the}}se organic reagents at different concentrations has been assessed and the degradation of these reagents monitored. Attempts have been made to grow the bacterium in the presence of the organic reagents, both in the absence and presence of sucrose, by adaptation technique. Electrokinetic studies on the chosen minerals namely, galena, pyrite, quartz, calcite and magnetite have been carried out both in the presence of the organic reagents and Bacillus polymyxa cells or metabolite. Biological stripping of the adsorbed collector reagents from the mineral surfaces have been examined through FTIR spectroscopy. The progress of bioremoval of the organic reagents along with the generation of newer reaction products has also been monitored through uv-visible spectroscopic technique. The results of this study highlight that Bacillus polymyxa and its metabolic products bring about the degradation of the chosen organic flotation collectors. Further, the bacteria are able to utilise the collector reagents as carbon source for their growth, in the absence of added organic carbon (sucrose). Electrokinetic studies and examination by FTIR spectroscopy reveal that consequent to interaction with Bacillus polymyxa, significant surface modification on the mineral takes place. Probable mechanisms in the biodegradation processes are illustrated. Biological metabolic products responsible for bringing about the bio-deterioration have been analysed and characterised...|$|R

50|$|B. bohemicus {{mimics the}} cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} {{of the host}} bumblebee, facilitating entry into the nest. However, this mimicry of its host is imperfect in comparison to other members of Psithyrus, likely due to its variability of host. This likely contributes to B. bohemicuss relatively low invasion success rate compared to other members of Psithyrus. B. bohemicus also produces <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> which is a known worker-repellent, to aid its safe entry into the nest. In the first 24 hours after invasion, host workers undergo {{a significant change in}} their chemical bouquets, finishing with a qualitatively similar chemical mix to the invasive queen. Two hypotheses exist for this outcome. The first is that the workers begin to produce their own chemicals in an arms-race pattern to assume reproductive roles in response to the death of their native queen, which happens under normal conditions if a queen dies. The second hypothesis is that these chemicals are in fact applied to workers’ bodies by the invasive queen as she takes over to establish herself as the reproductively dominant individual.|$|E

The animal also develops a hive mind {{and in the case of}} dogs, secretes a chemically unique hydrocarbon similar to <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> a common ant pheromone. The new chemical has an extremely high molecular weight and dissolves slowly, which might help explain its unusually strong effect on larger animals.

50|$|Unlike other ants, {{they are}} seen singly or in small groups and their colonies consist of very small numbers of individuals. They are also unusual amongst ants in that the queen-worker {{difference}} is very limited and some workers can mate and lay fertilized eggs just like the queen. These workers are termed gamergates. New colonies are founded independently by single queens, and on aging they are replaced by several gamergates. The gamergates copulate with males from their own colonies and, being inbred, {{are related to the}} original founding queen. Colonies are very small, and they never undergo fission to form new colonies. The workers limit the number of reproductives in the colony by policing new workers that try to lay eggs when an active queen or established gamergates are present. Workers use alarm pheromones which include 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol and isopentyl isopentanoate. H. saltator, like many species of ant, produces 4-methyl-3-heptanone from mandibular glands. Dufour's gland secretions have been found to include a complex mixture of linear hydrocarbons from C15 to C25, with (Z)-9-tricosene being the main constituent, along with other minor constituents like tetradecyl propionate and traces of tetradecyl acetate and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Both the secretions from the postpharyngeal glands and the cuticular wax include methyl esters of common fatty acids.|$|E

Only the anosmics without smell since birth (congenital) reliably detected octyl acetate, {{and only one}} congenital anosmic detected decyl and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Anosmics who lost smell from head trauma proved to be selectively less sensitive. As expected, odor thresholds lay well below pungency thresholds. Eye irritation thresholds for selected acetates came close to nasal pungency thresholds. All three types of thresholds decreased logarithmically with carbon chain length, as previously seen with homologous alcohols and as seen in narcotic and toxic phenomena.

40|$|The Journal of Chemical Ecology, {{particularly}} {{in its early}} years was devoted almost exclusively to research on pheromones. In the 1970 s, considerable advances were being made in understanding the mechanisms underlying pheromone-mediated behavior, {{particularly in}} laboratory environments (e. g. R. J. Bartell at CSIRO Australia), as well as the chemical characterization of pheromones and recognizing the importance of minor components. However, there was little ecologically-based research at that time on the impacts of modifying pheromone-mediated behavior on the population dynamics of target pests, particularly in terms of validating the quantitative contributions of mating disruption or mass trapping to pest abundance within and between seasons. Among several reasons for this was that few sex pheromones of lepidopteran pests had been characterized and synthesised. However, in 1969, Wendell Roelofs published the identity of the main component of the female sex pheromone of a major moth pest with pan-continental distribution, the oriental fruit moth (OFM: Cydia (Grapholitha) molesta (Busck)), as cis- 8 dodecenyl acetate, recognizing from field assays that there were probably also uncharacterized secondary components. This breakthrough enabled the group at CSIRO Australia to begin larger scale field work, although there were initially challenges in getting sufficient quantities of synthetic pheromone. As an aside, there was evidence from early CSIRO field tests that the far cheaper saturated analogue, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> inhibited males from being attracted to live females or synthetic pheromone sources, but when extremely high background doses were released in a larger field trial, trap captures of males actually went up—all reflecting the lack of understanding of underlying mechanisms.

40|$|Animals often {{respond to}} danger by raising alarm to inform others. Alarm signals come in many {{different}} forms, such as visual or mechanical display, sound or odour. Some animals produce vocal alarm signals that vary {{with the level of}} danger. For chemical alarm signals, virtually nothing is known about such context-dependent signalling due to a general notion that alarm pheromones have fixed compositions. Here, we show that larvae of the Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) produce an alarm pheromone whose composition varies with the level of danger they face: the presence of a relatively harmless predator or a very dangerous predator, that is either actually attacking or not. The frequency of alarm pheromone excretion increases with the level of danger. Moreover, the composition of excreted alarm pheromone varies in the relationship between total and relative amount of the putative two components, decyl acetate (DAc) and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (DDAc). When pheromone is excreted with a predator present but not attacking, the percentage DDAc increases with the total amount of pheromone. When a predator does attack, however, the relationship between percentage DDAc and total amount of pheromone is reversed. Taken together, the alarm signal of thrips larvae appears to be context dependent, which to our knowledge is the first report of context-dependent composition of an alarm pheromone...|$|E

Increasing aliphatic chain length by two methylene groups increased half lives by a factor of approximately 7. 5 at 27 1 C. Half lives of saturated aliphatic acetates decreased with increase in temperature by 79. 2 %, 85. 5 % and 95 % for <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> tetradecyl acetate and hexadecyl acetate, respectively, between 22 and 34 1 C.

The present study sought to specify the particular cut-off homolog for sensory eye irritation in an acetate and n-alcohol series. A 1, 900 ml glass vessel system and a three-alternative forced-choice procedure served to test nonyl, decyl, and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and 1 -nonanol, 1 -decanol, and 1 -undecanol. Flowrate to the eye ranged from 2 to 8 L/min and time of exposure from 3 to 24 sec. Decyl acetate and 1 -undecanol were the shortest homologs that failed to produce eye irritation under all conditions, producing a cut-off effect. Increasing the vapor concentration of decyl acetate and 1 -undecanol by 3 and 8 times, respectively, via heating them to 37 °C made either or both VOCs detectable to only half of the 12 subjects tested, even though the higher vapor concentration was well above a predicted eye irritation threshold. When eye irritation thresholds for homologous acetates and n-alcohols were plotted {{as a function of the}} longest unfolded length of the molecule, the values for decyl acetate and 1 -undecanol fell within a restricted range of 18 to 19 Å. The outcome suggests that the basis for the cut-off is biological, i. e., the molecule lacks a key size or structure to trigger transduction, rather than physical, i. e., the vapor concentration is too low to precipitate detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Western {{flower thrips}} Frankliniella occidentalis {{produces}} conspicuous anal droplets that {{function as a}} direct defense against various predators. These droplets also function in pheromonal communication in that they contain a mixture of decyl acetate and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> which acts as an alarm. Exposure of thrips to synthetic pheromone is known to promote takeoff or refuge seeking, but {{the effect of the}} natural pheromone has not yet been studied. Here, we not only studied the response to natural pheromone, but also tested the new hypothesis that the alarm pheromone primes a defensive response in thrips. This test was carried out by measuring the reaction time to a simulated predator attack after exposure to synthetic or natural alarm pheromone (against a control with no pheromone at all). The reaction was quantified in terms of the time it takes a thrips larva to produce a droplet after attack. We found that thrips larvae produce droplets of alarm pheromone faster when cues associated with danger are present. There {{were no significant differences in}} reaction times of responses to synthetic pheromone, natural pheromone, or odors from a patch with a predator attacking a thrips larva. This implies that the synthetic pheromone mimics the natural pheromone, and that other cues emanating from the predator play a minor role.

40|$|In this work, {{three-phase}} liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) {{based on}} a supported liquid membrane (SLM) sustained in {{the wall of a}} hollow fiber was investigated with special focus on optimization of the experimental procedures in terms of recovery and repeatability. Recovery data for doxepin, amitriptyline, clomipramine, and mianserin were in the range of 67. 8 - 79. 8 %. Within-day repeatability data for the four basic drugs were in the range of 4. 1 - 7. 7 %. No single factor was found to be responsible for these variations, and the variability was caused by several factors related to the LPME extractions {{as well as to the}} final HPLC determination. Although the volume of the SLM varied within 0. 4 - 3. 1 % RSD depending on the preparation procedure, and the volume of the acceptor solution varied within 4. 8 % RSD, both recoveries and repeatability were found to be relative insensitive to these variations. Thus, the handling of microliters of liquid in LPME was not a very critical factor, and the preparation of the SLM was accomplished in several different ways with comparable performance. Reuse of hollow fibers was found to suffer from matrix effects due to built-up of analytes in the SLM, whereas washing of the hollow fibers in acetone was beneficial in terms of recovery, especially for the extraction of the most hydrophobic substances.

40|$|The Guatemalan potato moth, Tecia (Scrobipalpopsis) solanivora, is {{a serious}} potato pest in Central America and {{adjacent}} South American countries. Recently, it has been introduced to the Canary Islands, Spain. Insecticide treatments are not sufficiently effective against eggs and larvae of Guatemalan potato moth, which are protected from sprays in soil crevices and in galleries inside potato tubers, respectively. Deregulation of insecticides and restrictions {{in the use of}} the few available insecticides, parallel to a public demand for reduction of pesticide use in potato production, have increased the interest in biological control techniques. Behaviour-modifying chemicals, including sex pheromones, which target the adult life stage, are a particularly promising alternative to insecticides for control of Guatemalan potato moth. The aim of this study was to study T. solanivora sex pheromone and to investigate the feasibility of pheromone-mediated mating disruption as environmentally safe control technique. Chemical analysis of female pheromone gland extracts confirmed two previously identified compounds (E) - 3 -dodecenyl acetate (E 3 - 12 Ac) and (Z) - 3 -dodecenyl acetate (Z 3 - 12 Ac), plus an additional, saturated compound, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (12 Ac). These three compounds elicited significant male antennal responses by GC-EAD. Field trapping studies showed that a 100 : 1 : 20 -blend of these compounds formulated at 1000 μg on rubber septa, captured more males than the main compound alone. This trap lure can accordingly be used in field traps for detection and population monitoring. During two years, potato fields were treated with a 100 : 56 : 100 -blend of the three pheromone compounds formulated in polyethylene tube dispensers. Male attraction to E 3 - 12 Ac and Z 3 - 12 Ac is optimal at a 100 : 1 blend ratio, and only few males were attracted to traps baited with a 100 : 50 -blend. Mating disruption pheromone dispensers, containing these two compounds in a 100 : 56 ratio, did not attract males in the wind tunnel or in the field. The application rate of the 100 : 56 : 100 -blend of the three pheromone compounds was 28 g/ha in the first, and 86 g/ha in the second year. In both years, T. solanivora male attraction to synthetic pheromone traps were almost completely suppressed, indicating that sexual communication was disrupted. During the second year, additional tests confirmed that the pheromone treatment prevented mate-finding and mating. Attraction to traps baited with live calling females was reduced by 89 % in the pheromone treatment, during two months. In addition, matings in small field cages were significantly reduced. Visual observations showed that few males were observed in the pheromone-treated, as compared to the control field. At harvest, potato infestation was significantly lower in the treated field, as compared to control. Future studies will aim at the optimization of dispenser formulation, and area-wide implementation of the mating disruption technique for control of Guatemalan potato moth...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{developments}} in mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography (GC) and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as analytical techniques, and specific applications of these developments and traditional MS and GC-MS {{to the analysis of}} organic samples. The majority of this work has been published in the refereed scientific literature. A detailed theoretical study was undertaken into the relationships between chromatographic resolution in combined GC-MS and carrier gas flow rate. The influence that the type of GC-MS interface has on optimum flow rate requirements was quantified. A simple equation relating column length, column 'hold-up' time and volumetric flow rates in directly coupled capillary GC-MS was derived, facilitating the setting of the appropriate optimum gas flow in this mode. Average linear gas velocities and flow rates required to deliver optimum performance for a variety of column diameters, carrier gases and types of GC-MS interface were reported, together with the 'hold-up' times and inlet pressures necessary to deliver these values. The dependence between carrier gas flow rates, average linear velocities and temperature programming was determined for a number of GC-MS interface and flow control combinations. Discrimination caused by the 'open-split' interface in GC-MS was examined, and a numerical relationship was established between GC oven temperature and effluent yield in temperature programmed analyses. A GC-MS screening procedure for a large group of target analytes was created using a 'bench-top' quadrupole mass spectrometer, enabling automatic detection at trace levels of genuine or potential 'positives' from crude extracts. Two representative ions of the target substance had to occur in the correct ratio and at a specific and automatically adjusted retention time for a 'positive' report. For maximum sensitivity a number of time windows were created, and selected ion monitoring of the two characteristic ions for each target compound was carried out. Although the protocol was developed for screening extracts of biological fluids for drugs, it could be applied to screening for target compounds from any matrix. The technique of 'Selected Reaction Monitoring' of fragmentations within the first field-free region of a double-focussing instrument of Nier-Johnson geometry was developed, and applied to the quantitative determination of drugs and drug metabolites from body fluid extracts using stable isotope labelled internal standards. This method, an aspect of the now widely adopted 'Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry' (MS/MS) techniques, greatly increased the specificity of the detection of target compounds. Warfarin from human blood and N-hydroxy phenacetin from human urine were quantified by this technique. These two examples {{were among the first to}} use a conventional geometry mass spectrometer in this way for the simultaneous monitoring of daughter ions from different parents from the first field-free region of the spectrometer. Conventional low and high resolution MS and GC-MS were applied to the analysis of essential oils, wasp secretions and plant gums and waxes. The essential oils of six hop cultivars were analysed in detail, particularly with respect to the levels of selinene isomers. Commercial extracts of Boronia megastigma flowers were analysed by GC-MS; (Z) -heptadec- 8 -ene and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were identified as major components, together with the new oxygenated sesquiterpene 'sesquicineole' in some clones, and some fifty other volatile components. A library of several hundred reference mass spectra was compiled to enable analyses on a range of essential oils to be undertaken. This was made available to the MS community via the U. S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) database. A collection of 'Kovats' GC retention indices, important corroborative evidence for the MS identification of essential oil related compounds, was obtained from a diverse range of literature sources for 400 mono- and sesquiterpenes. This collection of data was published as a review article. Based on MS evidence in conjunction with microchemical reactions and subsequent comparison with authentic standards, (E,E) - 2, 8 -dimethy 1 - 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]- undecane, (E,E) - 2 -ethy 1 - 7 -methy 1 - 1, 6 -dioxaspiro[4. 5]- decane, (Z,E) - 2, 8 -dimethy 1 - 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]undecane and 2 -methyl- 6 -penty 1 - 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-pyran were identified in the mandibular gland secretions of parasitic wasps. The structures of three new cycloartenone related triterpenes from Gardenia species were determined primarily by MS from first principles; these were 9, 19 -cyclolanostan- 3, 24 -dione, 9, 19 - cyclolanost- 24 -en- 3, 23 -dione, and 9, 19 -cyclolanostan- 3, 23 -dione...|$|E
