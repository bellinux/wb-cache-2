5|$|The {{division}} was developed around {{the nucleus of}} an <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> battalion which had briefly seen combat against the Yugoslav Partisans in eastern Bosnia {{as part of the}} 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). Composed of Muslim Albanians with mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it was given the title Skanderbeg after medieval Albanian lord George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, who defended the region of Albania against the Ottoman Empire {{for more than two decades}} in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{campaign}} was criticized for high civilian casualties, including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11June, Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence. In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> militias in the Republic of Macedonia. , 4,882KFOR soldiers, representing 31countries, continue {{to operate in the}} area.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, nearly 30,000 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> Muslims were {{expelled}} from the coastal region of Epirus in northwestern Greece, an area known among Albanians as Chameria.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} formed by <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> living in the Stockholm region with the goal to uniting <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> in a team that would later compete in the higher tiers of Swedish football. It {{was also the first}} {{gathering}} point of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> in the Swedish capital since this ethnic group lacked any kind of union or club whatsoever.|$|R

25|$|Several {{months after}} the end of the conflict, some armed provocations persisted. Small bombings and shootings occurred. The most serious provocations {{happened}} when three Macedonian police officers were killed in an ambush by <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> gunmen on 12 November 2001.|$|E
25|$|During the Kosovo {{crisis of}} 1999, 600 Belgian paratroopers participated in Operation Allied Harbour, a NATO {{operation}} {{to protect and}} provide assistance to the huge number of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> refugees in Albania and Macedonia. That same year, 1,100 Belgian soldiers left for Kosovo {{to participate in the}} Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force.|$|E
50|$|Before the 2014 World Cup, a {{significant}} presence of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> had been noted in several national teams. On 5 March 2014, 54 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> were called up by seven different national teams: Albania (19), Kosovo (22), Switzerland (5), Macedonia national football team (4), Finland (2), Germany (1) and Montenegro (1).|$|R

50|$|On March 10, several acts of {{violence}} were recorded in Skopje and Tetovo. In Skopje, a group of youngsters, <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians,</b> beat a 66-year-old. In addition, a wooden bridge over the Vardar River was burned. In Tetovo, <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> beat a 16-year-old girl. Also, a policeman was physically assaulted. Five people were arrested.|$|R
25|$|On 9 May 2015 8 Macedonian police {{officers}} and 14 gunmen {{were killed in the}} fighting in an <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> part of the town of Kumanovo. Those named were members of Kosovo Liberation Army. In an announcement released by NLA’s spokesperson from Gostivar NLA has taken responsibility for the attacks on the Macedonian police.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of March, NLA forces reappeared in the hills above Tetovo, a key {{northwest}} Macedonian town with an <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> majority. The insurgents fired down on Macedonian positions using rifles, machine guns and mortars. At that point the NLA controlled at least seven villages {{to the north and}} west of Tetovo, all of which were up in the mountains and easily defensible.|$|E
25|$|Kosovo's {{status was}} a key issue in the {{political}} violence that presaged the Kosovo War of 1999. The <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> Kosovo Liberation Army sought to obtain independence for Kosovo, launching attacks on Serbian and Yugoslav security forces in Kosovo. The Serbian and Yugoslav governments strongly opposed this and instituted an increasingly severe military crackdown on Kosovo Albanian separatism, which eventually led to NATO launching a campaign of air strikes.|$|E

25|$|In November 1913 the Albanian pro-Ottoman {{forces had}} offered {{the throne of}} Albania to the Ottoman war {{minister}} of Albanian origin, Izzet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire sent agents to encourage a revolt, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. Izzet Pasha sent major Beqir Grebenali, another <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian,</b> {{to be one of}} his chief representatives in Albania. The Provisional Government of Albania under control of Ismail Qemali captured and executed major Beqir Grebenali.|$|E
25|$|Inter-ethnic {{tensions}} {{continued to}} worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, employing {{a mix of}} intimidation and political manoeuvring, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> population. Kosovo Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with {{the ultimate goal of}} achieving the independence of Kosovo.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to lack of}} evidence, Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and {{released}} from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened {{the question as to}} whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court. Stojanović's <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> wife and their two children have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians consider her a traitor for marrying a Serb. As of 2011, no one has been found guilty of participation in the Račak massacre and no known investigations are currently being held.|$|E

25|$|The 2001 {{insurgency}} in the Republic of Macedonia was an armed conflict which {{began when the}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> National Liberation Army (NLA) militant group attacked the security forces of the Republic of Macedonia {{at the beginning of}} February 2001, and ended with the Ohrid Agreement. There were also claims that the group ultimately wished to see Albanian-majority areas secede from the country, though high-ranking NLA members have denied this. The conflict lasted throughout most of the year, although overall casualties remained limited to several dozen individuals on either side, according to sources {{from both sides of the}} conflict. With it, the Yugoslav Wars had reached previously peaceful Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|The Macedonian {{security}} forces resumed their {{assault on the}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> insurgents for a third day, despite international pressure for a truce. A government spokesman {{announced that he was}} confident that the rebels would be defeated within four or five days. During the third day of the battle, the police claimed to control two thirds of the village, and were attacking the village centre where severe resistance was encountered. In the advance towards the village centre, {{security forces}} bombarded every new NLA point with artillery and tanks shells, and only afterwards sent in the police. This tactic was designed to exhaust the insurgents who, according to intelligence sources, had only limited supplies.|$|E

The Ottoman Empire sent agents to encourage a revolt, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. Izzet Pasha sent major Beqir Grebenali, another <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian,</b> {{to be one of}} his chief representatives in Albania. The Provisional Government of Albania under control of Ismail Qemali captured and executed major Beqir Grebenali. Such provocative and damaging display of independence of Qemali's government angered Great Powers and International Commission of Control forced Qemali to step aside and leave Albania. At that time the Commission was not able to force Essad Pasha to leave Albania, because it did not have enough authority.|$|E
50|$|The Ghegs {{predominantly}} live in {{the mountainous}} north, north of the Shkumbin river. This territory is {{sometimes referred to as}} Ghegeria. Little more than half of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> from Albania are Ghegs. Except for a small Tosk population around lakes Prespa and Ohrid in Macedonia, all <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> in the Balkans who live outside of Albania (Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro) are Ghegs.|$|R

50|$|A {{referendum}} {{on the status of}} the Albanians in Macedonia, declared illegal by the Macedonian government, was held in January 1992. 74% out of 92% of those eligible to vote, voted for the autonomy of the Albanians. On March 31, 1992, about 40,000 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> demonstrated on the streets of Skopje, asking that Macedonia be recognized as a country lest the rights of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> were recognized.|$|R
25|$|Alleged {{war crimes}} {{included}} incidents {{such as a}} three-day operation by Macedonian police against the <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> village of Ljuboten, from 10–12 August 2001, which left ten civilians dead and resulted in the arrest {{of more than one}} hundred ethnic-Albanian men, many of whom were severely beaten and tortured while in police custody. According to the Macedonian government, there was an insurgent presence in the village; however, a Human Rights Watch investigation on the ground in Ljuboten found no direct evidence of this. These events led to the trial of the then-Macedonian Minister of Internal Affairs, Ljube Boškoski, in the International War Crime Tribunal in The Hague. He was acquitted in 2008, but his co-defendant Johan Tarculovski was found guilty; both verdicts were upheld in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{ended on}} 24 July 2001 {{after a night}} of fighting. The next day Tetovo was quiet while <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> insurgents built up defences with sandbags. Across the {{graveyard}} Macedonian security forces were stationing armoured personnel carriers. After the battle there was a line dividing Tetovo with the city stadium being the"border". Although there were individual armed provocations until the end of 2001, the positions held by both sides inside the city of Tetovo, after the battle of 24 July, did not change. The biggest incident after the clashes on 24 July, happened on 7 August when the NLA made another attempt {{to take control of the}} city. The attack failed when the special units of the police launched a counter-strike and forced the insurgents back to their former positions.|$|E
25|$|In July 1990, the Kosovo Albanians {{proclaimed the}} {{existence}} of the Republic of Kosova, and declared it a sovereign and independent state in September 1992. In May 1992, Ibrahim Rugova was elected its president in an election in which only Kosovo Albanians participated. During its lifetime, the Republic of Kosova was only officially recognised by Albania. By the mid-1990s, the Kosovo Albanian population was growing restless, as the status of Kosovo was not resolved as part of the Dayton Agreement of November 1995, which ended the Bosnian War. By 1996, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanian</b> guerrilla paramilitary group that sought the separation of Kosovo and the eventual creation of a Greater Albania, had prevailed over the Rugova's non-violent resistance movement and launched attacks against the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police in Kosovo, resulting in the Kosovo War.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} between Kosovo-Albanians and Serbs have been hostile since {{the rise of}} nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer {{relations between}} each other.|$|R
50|$|The city of Tuzi lies in {{the east}} end of Gruda. Of Tuzi's 3,789 residents, more than 2,000 are <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians,</b> making it, {{according}} to the 2003 census, the heaviest concentration of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> in Malësia. Over the last 30 years there has been a minor influx from the surrounding villages of Albanians who are looking to take advantage of Tuzi's higher standard of living and better educational system.|$|R
