In very dilute solutions, or when the acid or base is very weak, the classical equation breaks down. Tizard’s deduction (Trans. Chem. Soc. 97, p. 2477, 1910) that the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution of a weak salt is constant, whatever the dilution, is, for the same reason, in error when the concentration is very low, or when hydrolysis is nearly complete. In the classical treatment it is assumed that, on the hydrolysis of a weak salt (B. A.) the concentration of free undissociated acid, and of free undissociated base in solution are equal, the ionisation of these two components being regarded as negligible, wherein lies the fallacy. The existence of the above erroneous assumption in the classical treatment has also been pointed out by E. W. Hullett (in a thesis presented last year – as yet unpublished).

The investigated items of RIPH consisted <b>of</b> the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> (DH), the compositions of amino acid, the nutritional parameters and the molecular weight distributions (MWD). The analysis of amino acid compositions of RIPH showed that essential amino acids such as isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and histidine took a high portion. The final Radix Isatidis protein hydrolysate digests (FRIPHD) contained the free amino acids of about 29. 4 %. Results from {{this study showed that}} RIPH is a good source of natural antioxidants that the formed peptides can resist physiological digestion in GI digestive system...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to characterise the performance of polymer stabilisers, partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), used in suspension polymerisation processes. The stabilisers are ranked by their ability to stabilise the dispersion characterised by the median coalescence time of a single drop with its homophase at a planar liquid/liquid interface. Results show that the stability of the dispersion relates closely to the molecular properties of the PVAcs. Other conditions being equal, PVAcs with higher molecular weights or lower <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> can better stabilise a liquid-liquid dispersion. The stability of the dispersion also depends strongly on where the PVAc resides. The presence of a PVAc in the dispersed phase significantly reduces stability. Consistent with results reported in the literature, considerable scatter has been observed on the coalescence times of identical drops under the same conditions. An explanation for the scatter is also proposed in the paper, based on the classical Reynolds model for film thinning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
