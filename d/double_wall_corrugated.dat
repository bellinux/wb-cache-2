A HDPE <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> pipes was tested and numerically verified to evaluate the performance of a damaged underground pipe in Malaysia. The numerical tool, LUSAS, used by them produced ten times higher results over the experimental result. In this current project, more advanced numerical tool has been applied to verify the experimental result and found the results which are almost exact with the experimental result. In this study, four damaged sample of 600 mm length and six undamaged sample of 200 mm length of HDPE <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> pipes both collected for tests to be carried out in the laboratory. The damaged pipe samples are for the investigation of their physical properties and the undamaged samples for the estimation of physical and mechanical properties of the pipe material. Physical and mechanical properties of the HDPE <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> pipes implied that the material used for the pipes as cable ducting systems did not comply with the code specifications. The HDPE <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> pipe was damaged due to the excessive backfill load.

40|$|Resistance to deteriorations (especially corrosion) {{and initial}} price are {{important}} features in selecting the proper pipe materials for sewers. Among {{different types of}} pipe material used in Malaysia sewers, concrete and <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> high-density polyethylene (DWC-HDPE) pipes are more common. Laboratory tests were conducted using cylindrical concrete samples coated by polyurethane and epoxy materials to investigate their ability to protect concrete pipe against corrosion. Secondly, the cured concrete pipe price was compared to sewer construction costs. Economic analyses were carried out to compare the prices of cured concrete and DWC-HDPE pipe in various diameters. The results revealed that the coatings act as a barrier against the aggressive environment. Besides, their ability was proved to prolong concrete service life. In addition, {{the results showed that}} using the coatings to prevent or delay concrete networks' deterioration (against corrosion) was at least 2 times more economical compared to sewer reconstruction. Furthermore, it was concluded that DWC-HDPE pipe larger than 600 mm is not economical to be used for sewers due to well performance of designed coatings on extending the concrete pipe service life. Finally, mathematical models were developed to assist engineers or designers to accurately select the proper pipe based on desired variables...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{characterization}} of metallic studs used to mount lightweight <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> systems is studied both experimentally and numerically.

Different experimental setups have been investigated to determine the equivalent translational and rotational spring values.

40|$|The Double-Wall, "Whipple" Shield [1] {{has been}} the subject of many {{hypervelocity}} impact studies and has proven to be an effective shield system for Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) impacts for spacecraft. The US modules of the International Space Station (ISS), with their "bumper shields" offset from their pressure holding rear walls provide good examples of effective on-orbit use of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield. The concentric cylinder shield configuration with its large radius of curvature relative to separation distance is easily and effectively represented for testing and analysis as a system of two parallel plates. The parallel plate <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> configuration has been heavily tested and characterized for shield performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. The <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield and principally similar Stuffed Whipple Shield are very common shield types for MMOD protection. However, in some locations with many spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall. As represented in Figure 1, there is an included angle between the two walls. And, with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective included angle constantly changes. This complicates assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls when using software tools such as NASA's BumperII.

40|$|The finite {{layer method}} (FLM) is {{presented}} as a discretisation technique for the computation of noise transmission through <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> It combines a finite element method (FEM) discretisation in the direction perpendicular to the wall with trigonometric functions in the two in-plane directions. It is used for solving the Helmholtz equation at the cavity inside the <b>double</b> <b>wall,</b> while the wall leaves are modelled with the thin plate equation and solved with modal analysis. Other approaches to this problem are described here (and adapted where needed) in order to compare them with the FLM. They range from impedance models of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> behaviour to different numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz equation in the cavity. For the examples simulated in this work (impact noise and airborne sound transmission), the former are less accurate than the latter at low frequencies. The main advantage of FLM over the other discretisation techniques is the possibility of extending it to multilayered structures without changing the interpolation functions and with an affordable computational cost. This potential is illustrated with a calculation of the noise transmission through a multilayered structure: a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> partially filled with absorbing material.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the transmission of}} sound through lightweight parallel plates, (plasterboard <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> partitions and timber floors). Statistical energy {{analysis was used to}} assess the importance of individual transmission paths and to determine the overall performance. Several different theoretical models were developed, the choice depending on the frequency range of interest and method of attachment of the plates, whether point or line, to the structural frame. It was found that for a line connected <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> there was very good agreement between the measured and predicted results, where the dominant transmission path was through the frame and the cavity path was weak. The transition frequency where the coupling changes from a line to a point connection is when the first half wavelength is able to fit between the spacings of the nails. For point connected <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> where the transmission through the frame was weaker than for line connection, the cavity path was dominant unless there was absorption present. When the cavity was sufficiently deep, such that it behaved more like a room, the agreement between the measured and predicted results was good. As the cavity depth decreases the plates of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> are closer together and the agreement between the measured and predicted results were not as good. Detailed experiments were carried out to determine the transmission into the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> cavities and isolated cavities. It was found that the transmission into an isolated cavity could be predicted well. However, for transmission into <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> cavities the existing theories could not predict transmission accurately when the cavity depth was small. Extensive parametric surveys were undertaken to analyse changes to the sound transmission through these structures when the material or design parameters are altered. The SEA models are able to identify the dominant mechanisms of transmission and will be a useful design tool in the design of lightweight partitions and timber floors.
