40|$|Purpose Theoretical {{background}} In {{order to}} constantly {{meet the new}} production goals and sharpen competitive advantage, focusing on improvement continuously is becoming more important. Achieving continuous improvement through small increments is a ‘world class’ practice (Schonberger, 2010). Perhaps the Japanese Kaizen {{is one of the}} best known improvement methods to offer a cumulative character (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008), provide on-going improvement and sustained incremental innovation (Bessant and Francis, 1999). Managerial problem The importance of Kaizen is exemplified by many existing studies and its implementation steps have been well studied (Ma et al., 2010). Although it appears simple on the surface to implement and as a tool for any organisation, Kaizen has been proved to be easier said than done, and difficult to sustain it in the long-term (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008). Prior studies have suggested that the successful implementaion of Kaizen needs to be supported by shop floor management (Handyside, 1997) and relay on a practice that can constantly bring issues up (Medinilla, 2014). The shop floor management contains many tools to support improvement (Figure 1). There are four building blocks: 5 S practice (sorting, streamlining, systematic cleaning, standardisation and sustaining), waste removal, standard operations, and visual management. Quality Control Circle programmes (QCCs) is an effective practice to collect improvement and implement improvement ideas (Ma et al., 2010). Figure 1 the building block shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> (Bateman and Brander, 2000, p 242) Research objectives (a) to define the roles of shop floor management and QCCs in Kaizen (b) to provide evidence of the linkage between the 4 building block shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> and QCCs (c) to provide evidence of the relationship between QCCs and long-term Kaizen (Figure 2) Methodology A survey is used in this study. In total, 371 valid samples are collected. The questionnaire is developed based on previous research to measure the implementation of the shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> (Soriano-Meier, 2002, Rahman, 2001, Terziovski and Sohal, 2000), the QCCs (Lillrank and Kano, 1989) and the improvement outcomes (Doolen et al., 2008, Farris et al., 2009). The study conducted canonical correlation analyses (CCA) to investigate and illustrates the relationships (Figure 3 and 4). CCA is a technique to test the significance of the correlations between one set of multiple dependent variables and a second set of multiple independent variables. It can also determine which variables are the most important (canonical loading > 0. 30) in a given pair of canonical variates. Findings The Table 1 shows that the canonical correlation between the 4 shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> and QCCs implementing measures was statistically significant. The results also indicated that the 5 S Practice and Standard Operations were significantly and positively correlated with QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation. These may appear to disagree with some of the previous studies (Bateman and Brander, 2000), as not all of the four building block tools support the QCCs implementation. The Table 2 shows that there are two significant canonical correlations between the QCCs implementing measures and improvement outcomes. For the first canonical pair, QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation were significantly and positively correlated with Shop Floor Performance and Improvement Knowledge. Where for the second canonical pair, QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation were also significantly and positively correlated with Shop Floor Performance but negatively correlated with Improvement Knowledge. These findings are in line with some previous studies in showing that QCCs could involve short-term holistic shop floor changes and enhance improvement participants’ problem-solving capabilities (Liker and Hoseus, 2008, Rapp and Eklund, 2002), but necessarily affect their senses of future improvement participations (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008). Contributions This study has three theoretical contributions: a) developing generic models for examining the relationships between shop floor management and Kaizen; b) providing evidence to determine the significance/goodness of fit of the models; and c) indicating that shop floor management implementation could provide a framework to maintain shop floor orders and discipline, hence, lead to the continuous improvement. Practical implications are also threefold: a) the shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> should be implemented regularly not only to eliminate waste and reduce variations in the standard operations, but also to initiate long-term improvement; b) it is feasible to apply QCCs to collect improvement ideas/ information to support Kaizen; however, c) more efforts may be needed to motivate employees to participate in future improvement activities...|$|R

40|$|Japanese Kaizen {{consists}} of two practices, Quality Control Circles (QCCs) and Teians (individual suggestion schemes). These are used in combination with shop <b>floor</b> management <b>tools</b> to achieve sustained improvement. 5 S (sorting, streamlining, systematic cleaning, standardisation and sustaining), waste removal, visual management and standard operations are the four building blocks for shop floor management. However, {{there is a lack}} of empirical studies that have explained the relationship between these tools in detail.

The model included the four tools with paths to the QCCs and Teians constructs. The results showed that only three of the four direct paths to Teians were significant (5 S, waste removal, and visual management). The explanation is that these three tools increased employees’ skills and experience which helped them to identify small-scaled problems and develop solutions within their work area.

Methods A cross-sectional study with type 2 diabetes patients aged &# 8805; 60 years, seen at a public healthcare organization {{in the city of}} Sao Paulo (SP). After the development of the Portuguese version, we evaluated the psychometrics properties and the association with sociodemographic and clinical variables. The regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic data, functional health literacy, duration of disease, use of insulin, and glycemic control. Results We evaluated 129 type 2 diabetic patients, with mean age of 75. 9 (± 6. 2) years, mean scholling of 5. 2 (± 4. 4) years, mean glycosylated hemoglobin of 7. 2 % (± 1. 4), and mean score on Spoken Knowledge in Low Literacy Patients with Diabetes of 42. 1 % (± 25. 8). In the regression model, the variables independently associated to Spoken Knowledge in Low Literacy Patients with Diabetes were schooling (B= 0. 193; p= 0. 003), use of insulin (B= 1. 326; p= 0. 004), duration of diabetes (B= 0. 053; p= 0. 022) and health literacy (B= 0. 108; p= 0. 021).

40|$|Chatter in {{machining}} process {{is one of}} the common failures of a production line. For a cantilever tool, such as a boring bar, the rule of thumb requires the overhang length of the tool to be less than 4 times the diameter. The reason is because longer overhang will induce severe tool vibration in the form of chatter during machining. When a longer overhang than 4 times diameter is necessary for performing special machining operations, damping methods are needed to suppress tool chatter. One of the methods is the constrained layer damping method. Materials, such viscoelastic material, are applied in the vibration node regions of the structure to absorb the concentrated vibration strain energy and transform the mechanical energy to heat. With a cantilever tool clamped in a tool holder, the clamping interface is usually the vibration node region. The friction in the joint interface with low normal pressure became another source of damping and can be used for tool chatter suppression in mechanical structures. Joint interfaces are well known to possess normal pressure dependent stiffness and damping. The normal pressure’s effect on the structures frequency response function had been observed by H. Åkesson [1] et al, and L. Mi [2] et al. However, the direct effect of the joint interface normal pressure on {{machining process}} stability hasn’t been investigated. In this paper, a cantilever tool with 6. 5 overhang length to diameter ratio is investigated. The direct effect of the tool clamping interface’s normal pressure on the machining process stability is studied. Three different levels of clamping normal pressure are tested with an internal turning process. The machining results indicate another adaptable solution on shop <b>floor</b> for suppressing <b>tool</b> chatter. QC 20130521 POPJIMXPRE...|$|R

40|$|Ergonomic {{injuries}} {{are not the}} result of acute events. An ergonomic injury develops gradually from continued actions combining force, motion repetition, posture, and duration. Because these injuries accrue over time, {{it is often difficult to}} determine their causes. Lacking a clear causal link, it is difficult to justify investments that are intended to prevent ergonomic injuries. A large computer manufacturer, Dell Inc, is targeting significant reductions in their factory injury rates. This thesis describes the evaluation of two desktop computer manufacturing facilities. As part of this work, OSHA logs from 2002 were analyzed, injury costs were collected, factory workers were surveyed, and biomaterials associated with ergonomic injuries were studied. The analysis of the OSHA logs determined that 70 % of factory injuries were ergonomic in nature and that a majority of the ergonomic injuries occurred as a result of work in the computer assembly (build) area. The costs associated with ergonomic injuries were computed on a cost per box (CPB) basis, a common metric used throughout Dell factories to determine financial impact. In order to evaluate, improve, and monitor the ergonomic factors on the factory <b>floor,</b> an evaluation <b>tool</b> for product and process design was developed. This tool incorporates risk factors of force, motion repetition, and posture while determining ergonomic scores for products and process steps. Tool validation was achieved by comparing ergonomic scores with worker product preferences, as revealed by an employee survey. Currently, the ergonomic evaluation tool is being used by the Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Department at Dell. A greater understanding of the causes behind ergonomic injuries, combined(cont.) with use of the evaluation tool, is contributing to Dell's efforts to continuously reduce the occurrence of ergonomic injuries and associated costs. by Sara Beth Mortenson Schiveley.

40|$|Leaf litter {{represents}} an important link between tree community composition, forest productivity and biomass, and ecosystem processes. In forests, the {{spatial distribution of}} trees and species-specific differences in leaf litter production and quality are likely to cause spatial heterogeneity in nutrient returns to the forest floor and, therefore, in the redistribution of soil nutrients. Using mapped trees and leaf litter data for 12 tree species in a subtropical forest with a well-documented history of land use, we: (1) parameterized spatially explicit models of leaf litter biomass and nutrient deposition; (2) assessed variation in leaf litter inputs across forest areas with different land use legacies; and (3) determined {{the degree to which}} the quantity and quality of leaf litter inputs and soil physical characteristics are associated with spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrient ratios (C:N and N:P). The models captured the effects of tree size and location on spatial variation in leaf litterfall (R 2 = 0. 31 – 0. 79). For all 12 focal species, most of the leaf litter fell less than 5 m away from the source trees, generating fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in leaf litter inputs. Secondary forest species, which dominate areas in earlier successional stages, had lower leaf litter C:N ratios and produced less litter biomass than old-growth specialists. In contrast, P content and N:P ratios did not vary consistently among successional groups. Interspecific variation in leaf litter quality translated into differences in the quantity and quality (C:N) of total leaf litter biomass inputs and among areas with different land use histories. Spatial variation in leaf litter C:N inputs was the major factor associated with heterogeneity in soil C:N ratios relative to soil physical characteristics. In contrast, spatial variation soil N:P was more strongly associated with spatial variation in topography than heterogeneity in leaf litter inputs. The modeling approach presented here can be used to generate prediction surfaces for leaf litter deposition and quality onto the forest <b>floor,</b> a useful <b>tool</b> for understanding soil–vegetation feedbacks. A better understanding of the role of leaf litter inputs from secondary vegetation in restoring soil nutrient stocks will also assist in managing expanding secondary forests in tropical regions...|$|R
40|$|Channel coding {{is a key}} {{component}} of artificial communication systems, allowing reliable communication using unreliable channels. In the last decade, iteratively decoded channel codes have become or clearly will become standards {{in a wide range of}} applications where large amounts of information must be communicated using unreliable media. Of the class of iteratively decoded codes, Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are arguably the simplest class to describe, and indeed were described more than four decades ago in 1963 by Robert Gallager. The current understanding of LDPC codes has progressed in several significant ways beyond what had been expressed by 1963 by Gallager. Importantly, irregular LDPC codes, whose parity check matrices do not have constant row and column sums, have been shown to significantly outperform their regular counterparts explicitly considered by Gallager. By 1999, researchers had defined a class of irregular ensembles, each characterized by a pair of polynomials. Along with this new class of ensemble, they defined an analytical technique, density evolution, that accurately predicted the channel coding performance of a typical code under iterative message-passing decoding. The pair of polynomials could be effectively be designed by optimizing the coefficients of the polynomial for density evolution threshold threshold. This thesis concerns a different class of ensembles, namely protograph ensembles. Protograph ensembles are characterized by a template graph called, intuitively, a protograph. The Tanner-graph representation of a code in the ensemble is a random lift of the protograph. Protograph-based codes have significant advantages over unstructured irregular codes in regard to implementation of their encoders and decoders. In the decoder, this structure can be used in at least two distinct ways to organize the computations defined by any message-passing algorithm. If, in addition to the protograph structure, circulant structure is imposed on each "section" of the matrix then a quasi-cyclic code results, bestowing even mores advantages, especially in the possible implementation of the encoder. A central difficulty in using protograph ensembles is finding a suitable protograph. Since graphs are discrete objects, there is no obvious correspondence to any optimization model using vectors of real numbers. Instead, the technique of simulated annealing has been applied with a remarkable degree of success. For example, on the AWGN channel, given a constraint on the node degrees, protograph ensembles can be found that achieve a threshold only half as far (measured in dB) from the Shannon limit as unstructured irregular ensembles. This simultaneously illustrates an inherent performance advantage of protograph codes over unstructured codes as well as the efficacy of simulated annealing as an optimization technique. A persistent problem which appears to be common in all codes optimized for density evolution threshold is that of error floors. On a superficial level, this is explained by the maxim that "There's no such thing as a free lunch. " In some contexts, such as in codes designed for the erasure channel, the phenomenon can be explained on a much deeper level, though it is not clear why the phenomenon should persist so universally. Still, even without a detailed understanding the cause of this problem, there are techniques that can mitigate error <b>floors.</b> An important <b>tool</b> toward this end is weight enumerators, which are discussed in chapter 3. Codeword and stopping set enumerators can be efficiently computed if a certain (non-concave) function can be efficiently maximized. Protographs that are selected on the basis of their enumerators have shown some success in reducing error floors...|$|R
