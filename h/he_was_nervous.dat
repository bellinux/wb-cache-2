25|$|On 26 January 2011, Uganda's most {{prominent}} gay activist, David Kato, was found bludgeoned {{to death in}} what authorities in Uganda characterised as a robbery. His photograph had been published in Rolling Stone. Kato had spoken at a United Nations-sponsored conference on the bill in December 2009, although his words were barely audible because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous.</b> Information in US embassy cables revealed that Ugandan human rights activists and anti-homosexuality bill supporters vocally mocked him during his presentation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} May, the Union {{forces had}} {{successfully}} advanced to within several miles of Richmond, but progress was slow. McClellan had planned for massive siege operations and brought immense stores of equipment and siege mortars but poor weather and inadequate roads kept his advance to a crawl. And McClellan was by nature a cautious general; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about attacking a force he believed was twice his in size. In fact, his imagination and his intelligence operations failed him; the proportions were roughly the reverse. During Johnston's slow retreat up the Peninsula, his forces practiced deceptive operations. In particular, the division under John B. Magruder, who was an amateur actor before the war, was able to fool McClellan by ostentatiously marching small numbers of troops past the same position multiple times, appearing to be a larger force.|$|E
500|$|The final rider {{to set off}} was {{the race}} leader Tony Gallopin (...) [...] Gallopin was 36 seconds ahead of Porte {{overnight}} and expressed hope {{that he would be}} able to defend his lead and take overall victory. Immediately after he set off, however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> and uncomfortable on his bike. (Gallopin, like most of the riders, was riding a conventional road bike with aero bars attached.) At the intermediate time check, he was already 58 seconds behind Porte; he lost another 41 seconds in the second part of the stage. His time of 22' 02" [...] meant he finished 29th on the stage and lost the yellow jersey. He dropped to sixth place overall.|$|E

Chris Turner attended high school at the Chaminade College Preparatory School, {{where he was a}} three-year letterwinner and starting quarterback in football and pitcher in baseball. As a sophomore, he was on the junior varsity football team until midseason when the varsity quarterback suffered an injury against Valencia High School, a regional powerhouse. Turner described the incident as the last time that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> during a game and said, [...] "It got pretty ugly to be honest. Ever since then, I've always thought to myself, 'It can't get worse than that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Band Wagon, which {{featured}} {{the music and}} lyrics of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, included an extensive dance sequence at the end, the [...] "Girl Hunt Ballet" [...] featuring Astaire and Charisse, which was a spoof of hard-boiled Mickey Spillane novels. Kidd was hired to stage the film's dances at Astaire's request, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about the ballet. Kidd said that he made Astaire comfortable by pretending {{that he was just}} making up the steps spontaneously. The film also featured [...] "Shine on Your Shoes", set in a 42nd Street penny arcade and featuring Astaire and LeRoy Daniels, a real-life shoe-shiner, and [...] "Dancing in the Dark" [...] with Charisse, set in Central Park.|$|E
500|$|Thunder II stands [...] {{tall and}} weighs over [...] [...] Nicknamed [...] "Dos" [...] by Judge, Thunder II has been {{described}} as somewhat timid with a more subdued personality than his predecessor. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> of the white markings on the football field and would try to jump over them. [...] He was also afraid of the cheerleaders' pom-poms. [...] For desensitization training, Judge and the rest of Thunder's team would haul him to the football field at a local high school to work with people carrying pom-poms and to run across a marked field. His handlers used operant conditioning with positive reinforcement, associating pom-poms with a carrot treat. [...] Eventually, he began turning to his handlers anticipating a treat whenever he saw a cheerleader with pom-poms.|$|E

500|$|In 1964 Richardson was {{the voice}} of General Haig in the twenty-six-part BBC {{documentary}} series The Great War. In 1967 he played Lord Emsworth on BBC television in dramatisations of PGWodehouse's Blandings Castle stories, with his wife playing Emsworth's bossy sister Constance, and Stanley Holloway as the butler, Beach. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about acting in a television series: [...] "I'm sixty-four and that's a bit old to be taking on a new medium." [...] The performances divided critical opinion. The Times thought the stars [...] "a sheer delight... situation comedy is joy in their hands". The reviewers in The Guardian and The Observer thought the three too theatrical to be effective on the small screen. [...] For television he recorded studio versions of two plays in which he had appeared on stage: Johnson Over Jordan (1965) and Twelfth Night (1968).|$|E
500|$|Before the {{recording}} process began, Rise Against wrote songs for the album above an antique store in Chicago, {{an environment that}} McIlrath described as [...] "roach-infested". Revolutions per Minute was recorded at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, from November to December 2002. Stevenson and Jason Livermore produced the album; the former also severed as the engineer and mixer, while Livermore mastered the album. McIlrath commented that Stevenson was the perfect person to produce the album, as he not only understood the nuances of the band, but was also their [...] "musical soul mate". Revolutions per Minute was the first album that McIlrath played guitar on. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about playing the guitar, as {{no one had ever}} scrutinized his ability, and described the process as [...] "playing blindly into the wind and hoping it was good enough".|$|E
500|$|Ray Park as Snake Eyes [...] A mysterious ninja {{commando}} {{who took}} a vow of silence, {{a departure from the}} character's traditional difficulty in speaking due to grievous vocal wounds, a close member of the Arashikage ninja clan, and Storm Shadow's rival. Park specifically practiced wushu for the role, as well as studying the character's comic book poses. Park was already familiar with the character, but knew very little of the surrounding saga of G.I. Joe versus Cobra, so he read the comics to further understand the character. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about wearing the mask, which covered his entire head quite tightly, so he requested to practice wearing it at home. He found the full costume, including the visor, very heavy to wear and akin to a rubber band; he had to put effort into moving in it.|$|E

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] was {{recorded}} at The Hit Factory studios, New York, and was mastered and mixed at Sterling Sound Studios, New York. Babyface recalled that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about recording with Madonna, since {{he feared that}} Madonna was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] in the studio, and that would ultimately be time consuming for the whole process. However, {{it was one of}} the fastest recording and mixing. The song was backed by a full orchestra and was also the first time that Babyface had worked with live strings. He recalled that using strings in the song was [...] " [...] suggestion, and it was Nellee Hooper who actually [...] She had worked with them before but for me it was a new experience". Along with Hooper, Jessie Leavey, Craig Armstrong and Susie Katiyama also worked on the strings and conducting.|$|E
500|$|From September 1936 to February 1937 Gielgud played Hamlet in North America, {{opening in}} Toronto {{before moving to}} New York and Boston. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about {{starring}} on Broadway for the first time, particularly as it became known that the popular actor Leslie Howard was to appear there in a rival production of the play. When Gielgud opened at the Empire Theatre in October the reviews were mixed, but, as the actor wrote to his mother, the audience response was extraordinary. [...] "They stay {{at the end and}} shout every night and the stage door is beset by fans." [...] Howard's production opened in November; it was, in Gielgud's words, a débâcle, and the [...] "battle of the Hamlets" [...] heralded in the New York press was over almost as soon as it had begun. Howard's version closed within a month; the run of Gielgud's production beat Broadway records for the play.|$|E
500|$|Mason {{has said}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I {{did have to}} stand up in front a group of people and tell them , I was gay. That was a little intimidating". The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is a difficult thing to do. Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport. The Australian gay and lesbian newspaper, SX News said [...] "Chris is the captain of the school basketball team, but once word he's gay gets out to the other teams it turns nasty for him".|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Billboard gave the album a four-star review, {{describing}} it as a [...] "swingy trio set. It's quiet piano with a fine feeling for time."

500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> and upset {{that he had}} made people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E
500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} to {{show people}} he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nervous</b> and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] he told himself. Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
