5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium foil {{is used in}} {{cladding}} titanium {{to steel}} because it is compatible with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor.</b> When it seems as if Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers {{a message}} from her mother after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving her closure. Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley {{that he plans to}} {{overload}} the Anesidoras <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> and destroy the station, thus ensuring that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E
5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: The Flood. During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, the Pillar of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a {{last line of defense}} against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. At the request of the installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating the Pillar of Autumns <b>fusion</b> <b>reactor</b> core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E
40|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{the feasibility of}} fusion power are examined, taking into account fuel cycles and breeding reactions, energy balance and reactor conditions, approaches to fusion, magnetic confinement, magneto hydro dynamic instabilities, micro instabilities, and the main technological problems which have to be solved. Basic processes and balances in <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors</b> are considered along with {{some aspects of the}} neutronics in <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> the physics of neutral beam heating, plasma heating by relativistic electrons, radiofrequency heating of fusion plasmas, adiabatic compression and ignition of <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> dynamics and control of <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> and aspects of thermal efficiency and waste heat. Attention is also given to fission-fusion hybrid systems, inertial-confinement fusion systems, the radiological aspects of <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> design considerations of <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> and a comparative study of the approaches to fusion power. The nuclear fuel cycle, also called nuclear fuel chain, is the progression of nuclear fuel through a series of differing stages. It consists of steps in the front end, which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the service period in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the back end, which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either reprocess or dispose of spent nuclear fuel. If spent fuel is not reprocessed, the fuel cycle is referred to as an open fuel cycle (or a once-through fuel cycle); if the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is referred to as a closed fuel cycle. ...|$|R

25|$|Nuclear fusion {{has many}} {{potential}} attractions.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{radioactive}} waste issue for <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors,</b> proposing an innovative solution (the "zero-waste" option), which could be a clear advantage of fusion power versus fission, in view of its ultimate safety and public acceptance. Its goal is the Clearance (declassification to non-radioactive materials) of all reactor components, after a sufficient period of interim decay, according to the recommendations recently issued by IAEA. Even if feasible in theory, a zero-waste option for <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors</b> using the Deuterium-Tritium fuel cycle {{will be difficult to}} obtain in practice: a relevant amount of radioactive materials from reactor decommissioning - even if recyclable within the nuclear industry - should be disposed of as low-level waste. As a further step towards the zero-waste option, the features of <b>fusion</b> <b>reactors</b> based on alternative advanced fuel cycles have been examined, to assess whether that goal could be reached for such devices. <b>Fusion</b> <b>reactors</b> with advanced Deuterium-Helium- 3 (DHe) fuel cycle have quite outstanding environmental advantages. Compact ignition tokamaks can be designed in order to achieve DHe ignition. Ignitor, a compact ignition experiment aimed at studying DT plasmas, may also be used in that direction. The extrapolation of Ignitor technologies towards a larger and more powerful experiment using advanced fuel cycles (Candor) is described. Results show that Candor does reach the zero-waste option. A <b>fusion</b> power <b>reactor</b> based on the DHe cycle could be the ultimate correct response to the environmental requirements for future nuclear power plants...|$|R
