With {{the development of the}} lip pressure method, however (James 1962), an accurate method was derived which could measure the flow when a geothermal well discharges to the atmosphere at sonic velocity. Fortunately most discharges from wells do in fact attain such velocities, {{and as long as the}} enthalpy of the mixture is known, the flow can be determined. Where the enthalpy is unknown some other measurement has also to be made in order to solve the two factors of flow and enthalpy. By discharging the whole mixture into a silencer, the water portion can be estimated by means of a weir, and this provides the second measurement (described in James 1966) required to solve both unknowns. With the hoped-for commercial success of the total energy turbine in the near future, it will be necessary to have a means of measuring the steam-water flow into the machine. As long as the enthalpy of the flowing fluid is known, there should be no intrinsic difficulty in obtaining this, as the nozzles themselves act as metering devices due to the phenomena of sonic velocity at the throat. High gas concentrations in the steam phase, together with high chemical content in the water phase, require the use of “corrections” which will have to be determined from field tests to confirm theory. Clean steam-water mixtures appear to present no difficulties. 7 refs...|$|R

40|$|Early in 1976, JPL {{conducted}} a survey of California utilities to ascertain {{their views on the}} probable rate of geothermal development in the State of California in the immediate future (Reference 1). At the time the survey was conducted, the only firm utility plans for geothermal generating capacity were for the Geysers dry steam field in Northern California; experimental work on utilization of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>fields</b> of the Imperial Valley was in its early stages. All of the utilities contacted indicated a willingness to consider geothermal energy as an alternative to gas- and oil-fired plants, but most emphasized that their prime reliance would be on nuclear power to meet future demand growth. Over the ten-year period 1976 - 1986, they foresaw a maximum of 2500 MW of geothermal capacity coming on-line, and, of this, 2150 NW was at The Geysers (see Figure 1). Since that survey was conducted, a number of new factors have entered the utility planning picture. Most significant has been the hardening of attitudes in the State against the installation of nuclear plants, and the emphasis on seeking alternative energy sources. Two major nuclear projects, Sundesert and San Joaquin, have been abandoned, and the passage of stiff regulatory laws governing nuclear installations has made approval of Dew nuclear projects in the State highly improbable for the foreseeable future. In addition, the State has moved to simplify and accelerate the approval procedure for geothermal plants in particular, and has published regulations intended to reduce the time required for obtaining approval for Notice of Intent (NOI) (to construct an electric generating plant) and for Application for Certification (AFC) (of the proposed generating plant) from the California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (CERCDC) to one year. Previously, this NOI/AFC approval process had been taking two to four years to complete, and was cited by utilities as a major deterrent to commitment to geothermal plants. Other factors entering the planning equation include the implementation of the Federal Geothermal Loan Guaranty Program, authorized by the Geothermal Research and Development Act of 1974 (PL 93 - 410), but not yet implemented when the survey was taken; and the additional experience provided-by two-and-one-half years of working with the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> resources of the Imperial In view of the changed environment, JPL was requested by the U.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the optimal extraction of energy from a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> geothermal <b>field.</b> In view of the relative "commercial" availability of the many energy sources alternative to geothermal, it is possible that a socially "best" extraction policy may not include producing geothermal energy as fast as the current technology will permit. Rather, a truly "optimal" policy will depend on, among other things, the costs and value of geothermal energy in the future and the analogous values of other energy sources. Hence, a general approach to this problem would make the policy contingent on pertinent information on alternative sources. A good example of this approach is given in Manne's (1976) Energy Technology Assessment Model, where he points out that "Each energy source has its own cost parameters and introduction date, but is interdependent with other components of the energy sector.

40|$|In a {{presentation}} to the First Stanford Geothermal Workshop last year, we outlined the basic philosophy, assumptions and general approach to finding an optimal rate of energy extraction from a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> geothermal <b>field.</b> In this paper, we present the explicit relationships governing the physical processes and economic factors of our model, {{as well as the}} modifications to the model that have been necessary to accommodate the more specific articulation of these relationships. The conceptual modifications of the earlier model are subtle, but of great importance in making our work more useful for geothermal resource management. We adopt the hydro-thermal model developed by Gringarten and Sauty, and assume that the value of geothermal energy is known as a function of time and the quantity of extracted energy. We note however that our optimization model can be modified to accommodate other hydrothermal models such as that of Kasameyer and Schroeder, which combines fractured and porous media flow. In view of the increase in the attractiveness of geothermal energy for space heating, we also assume that the extracted energy is used for generation of steam to be used for this purpose. However, we are well aware that the hot brine, depending on the parameters of a particular field, may be more economically utilized for some other purpose (e. g., electric power generation, direct utilization of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> for domestic and industrial use, mineral extraction and desalinization).
