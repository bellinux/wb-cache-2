40|$|This thesis work {{features}} {{the exploration of}} the capabilities and limitations of devices based on MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) grown IIInitride materials under three principal applications: photovoltaics, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and terahertz emitters. InGaN solar cells covering the deep UV to the red ranges of the solar spectrum were fabricated. The increase in indium composition in the alloys to absorb longer wavelengths resulted in considerable leakage and series resistance caused by a combination of surface electron accumulation and electrically active line defects. A combination of thermal annealing, improved ohmic contact metal selection, electrochemical anodization, and grain coarsening resulted in improved performance. Higher sheet densities and sheet current with minimal leakage was obtained in an AlGaN/GaN HEMT by optimizing the design to include a GaN cap as a tunneling barrier and an AlN interbarrier to increase 2 DEG confinement. Furthermore, a novel technique using a 325 nm, surface sensitive laser to perform micro-Raman thermal mapping on HEMTs was developed. The technique utilized higher order A 1 (LO) phonons for higher thermal sensitivity. Lastly, progress was made toward GaN THz emitter development by achieving low series resistance operation through improved metal contact selection and ultra high <b>Ge</b> <b>donor</b> doping via MBE...|$|E
40|$|Germanium (Ge) is a group-IV {{indirect}} {{band gap}} semiconductor, and therefore bulk Ge cannot emit light efficiently. However, the {{direct band gap}} energy {{is close to the}} indirect one, and significant engineering efforts are being made to convert Ge into an efficient gain material monolithically integrated on a Si chip. In this article, we will review the engineering challenges of developing Ge light sources fabricated using nano-fabrication technologies compatible with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) processes. In particular, we review recent progress in applying high-tensile strain to Ge to reduce the direct band gap. Another important technique is doping <b>Ge</b> with <b>donor</b> impurities to fill the indirect band gap valleys in the conduction band. Realization of carrier confinement structures and suitable optical cavities will be discussed.

40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) and photo-EPR {{investigations of}} as-grown, post-growth annealed and electron irradiated zinc germanium diphosphide (ZnGeP 2) crystals allowed {{the determination of}} native acceptor- and donor-related defect levels in the ZnGeP 2 bandgap. From the photoinduced generation of the VZn EPR spectrum for electron-irradiated samples with the Fermi-level above the recharging level it is inferred that the VZn / acceptor state is located at 1. 0270. 03 eV below the conduction band. Observation of the recharging process in as-grown and post-growth annealed samples yields the localization of the <b>Ge</b> anti-site <b>donor</b> level GeZn +/++ at Eopt EV þ 1 : 7070 : 03 eV.

40|$|Germanium (Ge) is a group-IV {{semiconductor}} promissing {{for both}} advanced electronics and photonics applications integrated on Silicon (Si) chips. The high electron mobility is favourable for the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, while the quasi-indirect band gap character {{is useful for}} developing light sources for Si photonics. In this talk, we will review the current developments of Ge light sources fabricated using nano-fabrication technologies compatible with CMOS processes. In particular, we review recent progress in applying high-tensile strain to Ge to reduce the direct band gap. By making a freestanding beam using Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) processes, extremely high-tensile strain exceeding a few % can be applicable to Ge, converting indirect to direct band gap characters. Another important process is doping <b>Ge</b> with <b>donor</b> impurities to fill the indirect band gap valleys in the conduction band. Realization of carrier confinement structures and suitable optical cavities will also be discussed.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{photoluminescence}} (PL) measurements performed on high quality single crystal ZnO implanted with radioactive 73 Ga and 73 As, {{both of which}} decay to stable 73 Ge, are presented. Identical effects are observed in the two cases, with a sharp line at 3. 3225 (5) eV found to grow in intensity {{in accordance with the}} growth rate of the Ge daughter atom populations. On the strength of the well-established result that Ga occupies Zn sites, we conclude from the identical outcomes for 73 Ga and 73 As implantations that implanted As also preferentially occupies Zn sites. This result supports the findings of others that As preferentially occupies the Zn rather than the O site in ZnO. The thermal quenching energy of the 3. 3225 (5) eV line is found to be only 2. 9 (1) meV in contrast to its large spectral shift of 53. 4 (1) meV with respect to the lowest energy free exciton. The PL is attributed to exciton recombination at neutral <b>Ge</b> double <b>donors</b> on Zn sites involving transitions that leave the donor in an excited state...|$|R

The measurement of TEES spectra in the temperature range 90 – 400 K were performed at different heating rates. The level´s positions and their capture cross- sections {{were obtained by}} using the heating rate method. It was found out that near midgap levels in samples doped with shallow donors (Cl, In) have a relatively low value of capture cross-section (~ 10 - 15 - 10 - 17 cm 2) and are hole traps.

In the low concentration range, phonon scattering by isolated P donors is very weak in contrast with that by Group-V <b>donors</b> in <b>Ge</b> and Li <b>donor</b> in Si. This {{is due to the}} large valley orbit splitting of the P donor ground state. For samples with donor concentrations higher than 4. 7 x 10 ^ 17 cm- 3, thermal résistance becomes larger than that predicted by a simple theory on the basis of phonon scattering by a single donor center. In this concentration range, thermal conductivity has the temperature dependence Tn (n ≃ 2) at low temperatures (T ≲ 10 K) ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{review of}} {{experimental}} heat pulse techniques with interpretations of some typical data is given. Several heat pulse generators are described including thin films utilizing pulsed currents, tunnel junctions and superconducting films {{in which the}} down-conversion of high frequency phonons occurs. The black body radiation model will be reviewed and related to {{the temperature of the}} pulsed current generator and the resulting phonon propagation. A brief review of heat pulse detectors will be given in order to characterize their properties as a function of temperature and magnetic field. Results of heat pulse experiments will be presented by interpreting several portions of some detected heat pulse signals including [1] the ballistic region and the relation between the energy and phase velocities [2], the second sound regime (if any) and its relation to normal and umklapp scattering rates [3], the scattered or diffusive portions and their relation to crystal defects and phonon polarization. Of the specific examples of scattering to be discussed, emphasis will be on phonon scattering in <b>Ge</b> due to <b>donor</b> impurities...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature magneto-photoluminescence {{is a very}} {{powerful}} technique to characterize high purity GaAs and InP grown by various epitaxial techniques. These III-V compound semiconductor materials are used {{in a wide variety of}} electronic, optoelectronic and microwave devices. The large binding energy differences of acceptors in GaAs and InP make possible the identification of those impurities by low-temperature photoluminescence without the use of any magnetic field. However, the sensitivity and resolution provided by this technique rema 1 ns inadequate to resolve the minute binding energy differences of donors in GaAs and InP. To achieve higher sensitivity and resolution needed for the identification of donors, a magneto-photoluminescence system 1 s installed along with a tunable dye laser, which provides resonant excitation. Donors 1 n high purity GaAs are identified from the magnetic splittings of "two-electron" satellites of donor bound exciton transitions 1 n a high magnetic field and at liquid helium temperature. This technique 1 s successfully used to identify donors 1 n n-type GaAs as well as 1 n p-type GaAs in which donors cannot be identified by any other technique. The technique is also employed to identify donors in high purity InP. The amphoteric incorporation of Si and <b>Ge</b> impurities as <b>donors</b> and acceptors in (100), (311) A and (3 ll) B GaAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy is studied spectroscopically. The hydrogen passivation of C acceptors in high purity GaAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) 1 s investigated using photoluminescence. Si acceptors ~n MBE GaAs are also found to be passivated by hydrogenation. The instabilities in the passivation of acceptor impurities are observed for the exposure of those samples to light. Very high purity MOCVD InP samples with extremely high mobility are characterized by both electrical and optical techniques. It is determined that C is not typically incorporated as a residual acceptor ~n high purity MOCVD InP. Finally, GaAs on Si, single quantum well, and multiple quantum well heterostructures, which are fabricated from III-V semiconductors, are also measured by low-temperature photoluminescence.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{advances in}} Si/SiO 2 -based microelectronic processing witnessed {{over the past}} several decades can largely be attributed to relatively material-independent device scaling. However, with physical and economic limitations to the continued scaling of such devices appearing on the horizon, it is likely that near-term advances will come from the integration of novel and previously underrepresented materials. One of the most promising ways to enhance performance comes from the integration of judiciously chosen lattice-mismatched materials with Si. However, the integration of such structures typically poses significant technical challenges. The work contained in this thesis seeks to address several of these important issues, primarily through the use of relaxed, graded SiGe buffers on Si (i. e. Vx[Si 1 -xGex]/Si). Several new phenomena in relaxed graded SiGe buffers are developed in this thesis. A rise in threading dislocation density was observed in high-Ge content relaxed graded SiGe layers grown at relatively high temperatures, which was attributed to dislocation nucleation. This observation is contrary to conventional graded buffer theory in which high growth temperatures are expected to result in reduced threading dislocation densities (TDDs). (cont.) Additionally, a coupling effect between the effective strain and the growth rate was observed, as evidenced by increased TDD values at reduced growth rates. This observation is attributed to reduced growth rates allowing more time for the surface to evolve (i. e. roughen) during growth, thereby trapping mobile dislocations and necessitating the nucleation of additional dislocations to continue relaxing the structure. Also detailed in this thesis is the creation of two novel CMOS-compatible platforms for high-power applications: strained-silicon on silicon (SSOS) and strained-silicon on silicon-germanium on silicon (SGOS). SSOS substrate has an epitaxially-defined, tensilely strained silicon (-Si) layer directly on bulk silicon wafer without an intermediate SiGe or oxide layer. SSOS is a homochemical heterojunction, i. e. a heterojunction defined by strain state only and not by an accompanying compositional change, and therefore in principle SSOS may ease metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) -Si fabrication as SiGe is absent from the structure. SGOS has an epitaxially-defined SiGe layer between the strained silicon channel and the Si substrate, which is likely necessary to prevent excessive off-state leakage in MOS devices due to overlap of the source-drain contacts and the interfacial misfit array. (cont.) The thesis concludes with a study of utilizing buried -Si layers for improving the fabrication of SSOI substrate via the hydrogen induced layer exfoliation process. Previous work involving tensile -Si. 4 Geo. 6 layers in relaxed Ge/Vx[SiixGex/Si demonstrated that significant hydrogen gettering via the formation of strain-relieving platelets occurred within the tensile -Sio. 4 Ge. 6 layers, leading to an overall increase in layer transfer efficiency for GOI substrate fabrication. Buried tensile -Si layers in relaxed SilGex for SSOI fabrication, however, demonstrate markedly different hydrogen gettering behavior that is dependent on a combination of both the degree of tensile strain as well the amount of damage present in the adjacent Si. xGex alloy. It was determined that a tensile strain level of approximately 1. 6 % in Si (corresponding to a Sio. 6 <b>Ge.</b> 4 -based <b>donor</b> structure) was needed to create sufficient engineered damage to overcome the implantation damage in the adjacent Sio. 6 Ge. 4 layers and result in enhanced layer exfoliation. Lastly, an advanced Sio. 6 Geo. 4 -based structure which incorporated -Si layers as transfer, hydrogen gettering, and etchstop layers was demonstrated. Such a structure may prove useful for the reuse of significant portions of the original SSOI donor structure, thereby potentially speeding commercial adoption of the SSOI platform. by David Michael Isaacson.
