Of her signing, Beat head coach James Galanis said, [...] "She {{is a fantastic}} midfielder and someone who is fully focused on the game.

[...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E

In his diary Darwin called this [...] "the most memorable event which, {{for a long}} period, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> good fortune to enjoy." [...] His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage. Their discussion is not recorded, but a few months earlier, on 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his Principles of Geology as a work which would bring [...] "a complete revolution in [...] subject, by altering entirely {{the point of view}} in which it must thenceforward be contemplated." [...] and opening a way for bold speculation on [...] "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." [...] Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal [...] "an inadequate conception of the Creator", and by analogy with other intermediate causes [...] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".|$|E

I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's such a wonderful character to play. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer said: [...] "Barbara has contributed so much to EastEnders over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap." [...] Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy's final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the EastEnders website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the EastEnders theme tune known as [...] "Julia's Theme", called [...] "Peggy's Theme". Tribute was then paid to her in a clip programme, Peggy Mitchell: Queen of the Vic. [...] Peggy's final episode attracted 10.1 million viewers, and was the second most-watched programme in the week of 6–12 September.|$|E

Tomkins was booed by England supporters from opposing clubs within the Headingley crowd at Leeds, an incident which was criticised as [...] "disgraceful" [...] by Jamie Peacock, the England captain and Leeds forward, however Wigan head coach Michael Maguire claimed Tomkins {{had not been}} affected by the abuse. Following the completion of the rugby league domestic season, Tomkins was included in a pre-Four Nations test against France. In England's opening match of the 2011 Four Nations against Wales, he scored four tries, which {{for the second time in}} his international career equalled the record for the most tries by a player representing England. After playing against Australia at Wembley Stadium in a match which England ended the losing side, Tomkins scored a try against New Zealand. England's victory over the Kiwis meant that for the second time in three years, Tomkins featured for England in a Four Nations final against Australia, although they ended runners-up to Australia after losing 8–30. Playing fullback, Tomkins had an unhappy night under the high ball at Elland Road. A week after the final, he played at right wing and scored a try for the Barbarians, a British-based invitational rugby union side, against the Australian Wallabies, although the Barbarians lost 11–60. The match was Tomkins's first match of professional rugby union; Tomkins admitted that prior to training with the Barbarians he did not know what numbers were allocated to which position in rugby union. On his first experience of the sport, Tomkins was quoted by the BBC as saying, [...] "I am glad <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance to play but I am still a rugby league player." ...|$|E
