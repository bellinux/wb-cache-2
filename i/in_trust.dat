40|$|<b>Trust</b> <b>in</b> {{supervisor}} and <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization are argued to be distinct but related constructs, {{each with its}} own set of antecedents and outcomes. Empirical field results supported the proposition. Although <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> {{supervisor and}} <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization were positively and significantly correlated, <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> supervisor was more strongly associated with proximal variables (ability, benevolence, and integrity of supervisor), whereas <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization was more strongly correlated with global variables (perceived organizational support and justice). This conclusion held despite the inclusion of proximal variables in the regression on <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization and the inclusion of global variables in the regression on <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> supervisor. In addition to the differential antecedents of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> supervisor and <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization, the outcomes for both variables were different. <b>Trust</b> <b>in</b> supervisor was related to increased innovative behavior and satisfaction with supervisor, and <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization was related to higher organizational commitment and lower intention to leave. Therefore, the authors provide clear preliminary data on the distinctiveness of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> supervisor and <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> organization. One implication of this set of results is that organizations should adopt a more holistic approach <b>in</b> building <b>trust,</b> which can be achieved by focusing on the various constituents of the organization and the various levels (e. g., the supervisor level and the organizational level) ...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{determine}} the position of <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> media <b>in</b> relation to <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> other political institutions in Croatia. The main assumption is that institutional trust is a multidimensional phenomenon, which is as such evaluated by citizens who are able to distinguish different institutions and evaluate them according to individual performance. Furthermore, the article aims to define the determinants of each underlying dimension of institutional trust. The study draws from data gathered within the project <b>Trust</b> <b>in</b> Media 2009, on a nationally representative sample for Croatia (n= 1000). First, dimensions of trust were defined by the method of principal components (Varimax). The results confirmed the multidimensionality of institutional trust. Five dimensions (sub-scales) of institutional trust were extracted: <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> party and business elite, <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> state institutions, <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> cultural elite, <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> EU and <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> media. Results did not confirm the hypothesis on <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> media as a completely independent dimension of institutional trust. Second, inter-correlation and regression analysis was applied in order to determine <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> different dimensions of institutional trust. Frequency of media use proved to be the best predictor of institutional trust. Fre-quency of television viewing has a positive effect on <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> state institutions, while there was no evidence of the effect of reading daily newspapers on trust...|$|R
