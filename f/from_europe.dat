Our findings were that, stereotypical discrimination by employers was the cause for higher unemployment rate among immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> and OECD countries and perceived low skills by employers was the cause for lower earnings among immigrants <b>from</b> outside <b>Europe</b> and the OECD countries...|$|R
