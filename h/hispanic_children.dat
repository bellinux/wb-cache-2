2500|$|Milwaukee {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Polish centers, with 58,000 immigrants by 1902 and 90,000 by 1920. Most came from Germany, and became blue-collar workers in the industrial districts in Milwaukee's south side. They supported numerous civic and cultural organization and 14 newspapers and magazines. The first Polish Catholic parochial school opened in 1868 at the parish of St. Stanislaus. The children would no longer have to attend Protestant-oriented public schools, or German language Catholic schools. The Germans controlled the Catholic Church in Milwaukee, and encouraged Polish-speaking priests and Polish-oriented schools. Starting in 1896, Michał Kruszka began a campaign to introduce Polish language curricula into Milwaukee public schools. His efforts were panned as anti-religious, and thwarted by Catholic and Polish leaders. By the early 20th century, 19 parishes were operating schools, with the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and to a lesser extent the Sisters of Saint Joseph, providing the teaching force. The Polish community rejected proposals to teach Polish in the city's public schools, fearing it would undermine their parochial schools. The Americanization movement in World War I made English the dominant language. In the 1920s, morning lessons were taught in Polish, covering the Bible, Catechism, Church history, Polish language and the history of Poland; all the other courses were taught in English in the afternoon. Efforts to create a Polish high school were unsuccessful until a small one opened in 1934. Those students who went on attended heavily Polish public high school. By 1940, the teachers students and parents preferred English. Elderly priests still taught religion classes in Polish as late as the 1940s. The last traces of Polish culture came in traditional Christmas carols, which are still sung. Enrollments fell during the Great Depression, as parents and teachers were less interested in the Polish language, and were hard-pressed to pay tuition. With the return of prosperity in World War II, enrollments increased again, peaking about 1960. After 1960, [...] and were replaced by lay teachers. Increasingly, the original families have moved to the suburbs, and the schools now served black and <b>Hispanic</b> <b>children.</b> Some schools have been closed, or consolidated with historically German language parochial schools.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether childhood health disparities are best understood as effects of race, socioeconomic status (SES), or synergistic effects of the two. Methods. Data from the National Health Interview Survey 1994 of US children aged 0 to 18 years (n= 33911) were used. SES was measured as parental education. Child health measures included overall health, limitations, and chronic and acute childhood conditions. Results. For overall health, activity and school limitations, and chronic circulatory conditions, the likelihood of poor outcomes increased as parental education decreased. These relationships were stronger among White and Black children, and weaker or nonexistent among <b>Hispanic</b> and Asian <b>children.</b> However, <b>Hispanic</b> and Asian <b>children</b> exhibited an opposite relationship for acute respiratory illness, whereby children with more educated parents had higher rates of illness. Conclusions. The traditional finding of fewer years of parent education being associated with poorer health in offspring is most prominent among White and Black children and least evident among <b>Hispanic</b> and Asian <b>children.</b> These findings suggest that lifestyle characteristics (e. g., cultural norms for health behaviors) of low-SES <b>Hispanic</b> and Asian <b>children</b> may buffer them from health problems. Future interventions that seek to bolster these characteristics among other low-SES children may be important for reducing childhood health disparities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} large wave of low-English Hispanic {{immigration to the}} United States since 1970 has lowered native demand for public schooling. Our analysis focuses on California – where many of these immigrants settled – accounts for possible endogeneity of immigrant inflows using established settlement patterns, and uses relative outflows of the school-aged population to identify relocation in response to immigration-induced changes in school quality. We find that between 1970 and 2000, the average metropolitan school district in California lost five non-Hispanic students – three to relocation to another school district and two to private school within district – for every ten additional low-English Hispanic arrivals in its public schools. Districts that initially had fewer public schools lost more non-Hispanics to relocation, while private school flight was concentrated in districts with an initial presence of private schools. Our estimates suggest that the decline over this period in non-Hispanic public enrollment share in the average low-English <b>Hispanic</b> <b>child’s</b> school district would have been 25 percent smaller {{in the absence of}} flight...|$|R
