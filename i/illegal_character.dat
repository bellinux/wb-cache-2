5000|$|On March 5, 2011, Cotto {{returned}} to IWA {{in a live}} event alongside Abbad and the WWC Women's Champion La Morena. The tag team was dissolved {{in the middle of}} a feud, due to an injury to his partner. Cotto continued to feud for the tag team championships, but once the opportunity took place, he was removed, in order to introduce Savio Vega's student, Diego de Jesús. He was subsequently fired as part of a storyline, returning masked under his El <b>Illegal</b> <b>character.</b> He continued wrestling unmasked in the independent circuit, even challenging for the Extreme Wrestling Organization's heavyweight title under his common character, in a contest that ended in a double disqualification. Cotto went on to pursue a feud with the Intercontinental and Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Chris Angel. He was initially awarded the Intercontinental belt and Angel's undefeated record, but the result was revoked due to external interference from a second masked [...] "Illegal" [...] and an unclean pin. In a rematch, he won the Championship in a two on one contest, pinning Phillip Davian following an attack from a third masked wrestler. Zona 101 reunited on December 10, 2011, in Caribbean Wrestling Federation, an independent promotion based in the south region of Puerto Rico, where he teamed with one half of the CWF Tag Team Champions. The following week, the team was booked over Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez. On December 17, 2011, Cotto won the EWO World Heavyweight Championship, only to be interrupted by IWA president Miguel Pérez. This was in response to a previous confrontation between both, that occurred following a benefit card where Cotto wrestled and defeated Mesias. After defending the title at Tierra de Nadie 2012, Pérez once again reclaimed his contract. This was followed by confrontations in IWA's Histeria Boricua and Kaos & Odissey, which expanded to include EWO's CEO, Richard Rondón, as well. On February 25, 2012, following more intervention from the IWA, Cotto issued a challenge to end the conflict, an unification match for the EWO World Heavyweight Championship and IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. On March 1, 2012, the challenge was accepted by Pérez and Rondón in a backstage segment. At Clash of the Titans, Cotto lost the EWO World Championship, losing to a masked wrestler only known as [...] "Bonecrusher", whom he had defeated to win this belt and had since gained the IWA Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. In this match, a new angle was launched that involved him being involved in [...] "friendly" [...] confrontations with the other members of his stable, which was continued in the next event, Payback.|$|E
40|$|In Experiments 3 and 4, event-related {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} {{to verify the}} findings of the first two behavioral experiments. Similarly, Experiment 3 employed the lexical decision task and Experiment 4 used the position decision task. First, results revealed that a series of ERP components (P 150, P 200, and N 400) were found {{to be related to the}} effect of position-specific radical frequency when the lexical decision task was used (Experiment 3). However, when replacing the lexical decision task with the position decision task but keeping <b>illegal</b> <b>characters</b> as fillers, the effect of position-specific radical frequency became quite weak, which was only associated with P 200 (Experiment 4 a). Moreover, when using the position decision task but replacing <b>illegal</b> <b>characters</b> with geometric figures as fillers, there were no effects of position-specific radical frequency any more (Experiment 4 b). Second, the task was found to influence the time course for effects of position-free radical frequency, which was reflected by P 200 in the lexical decision task (Experiment 3) and by N 400 in the position decision task (Experiments 4 a and 4 b). Finally, simple character frequency could play a role in processing compound characters in which simple characters were used as radicals, but such effect was significant only in the position decision task and it was reflected by a change in N 400 (Experiments 4 a and 4 b). These findings indicate that position-specific radicals could play a role in character recognition, but this effect appears to be constrained by the task and/or the composition of materials. In contrast, effects of position-free radicals keep stable across different tasks and composition of materials. In addition, the findings also suggest that simple character information could exert influence on compound character processing, but only when characters are processed implicitly (e. g., in the position decision task). Implications of this research and future directions are discussed. This research was designed to examine the processing of different kinds of radical frequency information, i. e. frequency as a position-free radical, frequency as a position-specific radical, and frequency as a stand alone character. Whether the task or the composition of materials could influence the processing of such information was also examined. The first two were behavioral experiments and results indicated that effect of the position-free radical frequency was stable across the lexical decision task (Experiment 1) and the position decision task (Experiment 2). Effect of the position-specific radical frequency emerged only when the lexical decision task was available (Experiment 1). Wu, Yan. Adviser: Hsuan Chih Chen.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated age of acquisition (AoA) {{effects on}} early orthographic processing during Chinese character recognition. In Experiment 1, we measured {{the accuracy of}} identification of brief masked characters, accuracy was higher for early compared to late acquired characters. In Experiment 2, the visual duration threshold (VDT) was measured for both early and late acquired Chinese characters. The results showed that early acquired characters were successfully identified at shorter display durations than late acquired characters. Significant AoA effects were also found in Experiment 3, using a lexical decision task requiring mainly orthographic processing (discriminating real Chinese <b>characters</b> from orthographically <b>illegal</b> and unpronounceable <b>characters).</b> In summary, three experiments provide converging empirical evidence, for AoA effects on the early orthographic processing stages of Chinese character recognition. These results suggest that AoA effects during word identification go beyond the phonological or semantic processing stages. These results aslo provide cross-linguistic evidence for an AoA effect on early perceptual processing during identification. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a model of}} black market for foreign currency {{that focuses on the}} interaction of portfolio decisions and the determinants of the net flows of black foreign currency. The model explicitly incorporates foreign exchange restrictions as well as the demands arising from smuggling. Furthermore, this study analyzes the short run and the long run reactions of the black exchange rate to changes in the law enforcement efforts and the penalties levied on illegal trading. The relationship between political risk, a factor ignored in the literature, and movements in the black market exchange rate is also investigated. Time series tests such as cointegration and error correction are used to analyze data from various developing countries, such as Brazil and India, to test predictions of the model. ^ We find that foreign exchange restrictions are important and need to be considered before any predictions about the movement of the black market exchange rate can be made. We provide theoretical and empirical justification to elucidate the importance of the <b>illegal</b> <b>character</b> of the black market for currency. Empirical results using unique data set provide evidence that the authorities act in a way to restrict foreign exchange and encourage the acquisition of foreign exchange. Changes in political risk, a factor ignored in the literature, is shown to affect the movement in the black exchange rate.

5000|$|The {{character}} of Darryl was written as a [...] "villain" [...] archetype. The character is remembered heavily for his antagonistic characteristics. His most prominent storyline {{was when he}} locked major character Chris Warner in a barn, so as he would miss his wedding day, a storyline often recollected on by actors and producers. However the character also went through numerous other storylines, including the very first episode where Darryl fathered a child, only to push responsibility onto his teenage brother. The {{character of}} Darryl {{was said to be}} introduced to further develop the character of Marj and make her less comic relief. The character's evil nature was so great, producer Steven Zanoski {{thought it was a great}} precedent for villains to follow.

The need for accuracy is discussed in terms of both tackling terrorism, serious crime and other law enforcement investigations alongside the need to protect citizens from unwarranted infringement of their privacy as a result of ANPR misreads. The causes of inaccurate ANPR read data are examined in more detail and recommendations made as to how improvements could be introduced to minimise the risk of misreads and ???missed??? reads. This paper recommends future parameters of measurement and provides examples of gaps between the current standards and existing legislation. Laboratory and field testing was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of the factors that affect the performance of ANPR systems.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether there}} is a frame difference in online news coverage of the controversial 2014 Crimean referendum by The New York Times and the Russian newspaper, Kommersant. The research is grounded in framing theory and literature on the attribution of news sources. The study is conducted in two languages and it seeks to examine how media systems, perspectives on the issue, journalistic standards, as well as cultural backgrounds and historical ties influenced framing of the event. Sample online articles from each newspaper were selected and a quantitative content analysis was performed in order to identify the main themes, frames and source attribution patterns in media news coverage about the referendum. The pattern to quote official sources for providing justification and legitimacy to news stories has influenced the coverage in both newspapers: both The New York Times as well as Kommersant heavily relied on their respective government officials and experts. However, The New York Times provided a greater diversity of opinions supporting the values of a libertarian media system. Politics was the dominant theme of the referendum-related articles in both newspapers, however, Kommersant and The New York Times touched on economy and military themes with different frequencies. A comparison between themes in two periods (before and after the referendum) has not shown a meaningful difference for both newspapers. Kommersant’s online coverage was less critical of Russian policies and frequently utilized a set of the For-referendum frames, rarely touching upon Russian military activities on the peninsula. However, the frame depicting breach of international law appeared with the same frequency as the For-referendum frames, showing that Kommersant tried to maintain independence under the Russian neo-authoritarian media system. The New York Times focused on the illegitimate character of Crimean annexation and exposed every move of Russian troops, which is in line with U. S. foreign policy aims. However, the American publications did not hide the cultural and historical ties between Crimea and Russia and frequently mentioned the <b>illegal</b> <b>character</b> pertaining to Ukrainian protests and a temporary government...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{cigarette}} smuggling is now {{high on the}} agenda of governments and international organizations. It has been estimated that a third of internationally exported cigarettes are lost to smuggling. Total revenue lost by governments due to cigarette smuggling is estimated at US$ 25 – 30 000 million annually. • Studies of the impact of smuggling show that when smuggled cigarettes account for a high percentage of the total sold, the average price for all cigarettes, taxed and untaxed, will fall, increasing sales of cigarettes overall. • The cigarette companies often blame organized crime for the massive amount of cigarette smuggling worldwide, but much of the organized criminal smuggling that accounts {{for the vast majority of}} cigarette smuggling worldwide has occurred with the knowledge of the major cigarette companies themselves, and would not occur without the cigarette companies’ compliance. • In the Middle East, the two main target markets for international tobacco companies are the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. Both the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq represent huge possibilities for international cigarette companies. Indeed, tobacco trade journals, internal tobacco industry documents and documents filed in legal actions make the importance placed on both countries by the entire tobacco industry very clear. • According to trade journals, Cyprus is an important distribution point for American cigarettes going to the Islamic Republic of Iran through traders in Oman. At the same time, some of these cigarettes are sold to traders in Turkey who take them into Iraq. Beirut’s imported cigarettes are distributed to traders and merchants in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It appears that the major customers for cigarettes distributed from Lebanon are the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. From Beirut to Dubai or Oman and then on to the Islamic Republic of Iran is the path of some of the American cigarettes destined for Lebanon. Trucks now carry cargo through the Syrian Arab Republic to reach the open-air markets in Iraq. • In their legal action against several international tobacco companies, the European Union (EU) filed in January 2002 documents on cigarette smuggling into Iraq showing that since the early 1990 s, American tobacco companies have distributed their products from the United States into Iraq. For example, cigarettes produced in the United States have been shipped to and through ports in the EU to companies in Cyprus for years. Indeed, since 1996, approximately 50 billion cigarettes have been sent by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) (and its successor, Japan Tobacco) to Cyprus. Approximately half of these shipments were exported from Cyprus to Turkey in transit. Many of these shipments were destined for Iraq. • On 30 October 2002, the EU and ten Member States launched another lawsuit against RJR. The new EU lawsuit goes far beyond any previous allegations, accusing RJR of direct complicity in facilitating not only money laundering schemes but also other criminal enterprises. Allegations on cigarette smuggling into Iraq were even more detailed. • The EU allegations on smuggling in Iraq are in line with the well known methods of the cigarette smuggling scheme: – Exports of billion of cigarettes from major tobacco manufacturers. – Complex transport routes in order to complicate investigations. – Off-loading and re-loading of containers and removing marks and numbers from products to prevent their being traced. – Frequently switched bank accounts to cover up actions. – Operations led from Switzerland, a country protected by bank secrecy and business privacy laws. – Offshore companies located in Liechtenstein. – Use of tax-free harbours such as Mersin in Turkey. • Internal tobacco industry documents describe in great detail the monitoring of smuggling operations and the <b>illegal</b> <b>character</b> of the transit (smuggling) trade in Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic. Several documents stipulate that it is unwise for the tobacco companies to have direct links with the transit trade. • The objective of each company is to sell more products and make higher profits. Penetrating new markets and increasing the market share of its products is part of the strategy to achieve this objective. An obstacle for multinational tobacco companies are trade restrictions and/or embargoes. Some markets are closed to foreign companies or allow imported cigarettes only under certain strict conditions. Where there are high tariffs or a state monopoly, international cigarettes will be smuggled into the country, weakening the position of the state monopoly and delivering the market into the hands of the multinationals. • While illegal imports may be an option in order to penetrate a market, the ultimate goal in the long term is to obtain official imports or production. The strategy of the international tobacco companies in the Islamic Republic of Iran became a success story in 2002, when the state tobacco authority signed an import and production deal with four cigarette companies in a bid to cut down cigarette smuggling. It is a clear example of how successful this strategy of international tobacco companies can be. The stages of the strategy are: 1. Penetrate the market through illegal imports. 2. Weaken the state monopoly by reducing the market share of domestic brands and legal sales. 3. Convince the authorities to privatize or to open the market. 4. Authorize the legal import and/or production of foreign brands. 5. Stop fuelling the illegal market and take over the market in a legal way. • If tobacco smuggling is to be tackled successfully it will require international collaboration. The likeliest mechanism for achieving this is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In the text of the FCTC, article 15 deals with illicit trade of tobacco products, including markings, monitoring, data collection, cooperation, penalties, confiscation and licensing. • Manufacturers should be required to have covert and overt markings on all packages of tobacco products that would identify manufacturer, date and location of manufacture, and another identifier that would show the chain of custody—wholesaler, exporter, distributor and end market. The onus should be placed on the manufacturer (through record keeping, and tracing and tracking systems) to prove that the cigarettes that leave the factory arrive in their intended end market. • The way to combat smuggling is not to reduce taxes, but rather to control the supply of illegal cigarettes...|$|E
