25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in color and texture in step with other changes. The first printing's table of illustrations lists Thrór's map as the <b>front</b> <b>endpaper,</b> {{in accordance with the}} text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the <b>front</b> <b>endpaper,</b> in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text. This mess was not fully straightened out until the second edition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{endpapers}} or end-papers {{of a book}} (also {{known as}} endsheets) are the pages that consist of a double-size sheet folded, with one half pasted against an inside cover (the pastedown), and the other serving as the first free page (the flyleaf). Thus, the front endpapers precede the title page and the text, whereas the back endpapers follow the text. Booksellers sometimes refer to the <b>front</b> <b>endpaper</b> as FEP.|$|E

Fallows notes that the original choirbook source for the fragments was 29 x 21 cm. and that, when folded, nearly matches the size of the Drexel fragment, save for a 2 millimeter sliver.

5000|$|The purported oldest {{surviving}} anthropodermic binding {{appears to}} date from {{later in the}} 18th century. The Charles E. Young Research Library at UCLA owns a copy of Relation des mouvemens de la ville de Messine, printed in 1676, with the following note {{believed to have been}} written by James Westfall Thompson: 'The binding is human skin. The book is from the library of Armand Jerome Bignon (1711-1772), librarian of Louis XV.' This binding was analysed in 2017 by the PMF-MALDI process (See Identification, below), and is in fact sheepskin. The catalog entry has been updated to read: [...] "a manuscript note on the <b>front</b> <b>endpaper</b> of the volume, possibly in the hand of former owner James Westfall Thompson, states that the book was allegedly bound in human skin, although recent lab testing on a binding sample has now definitively shown that claim to be false." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the inside}} of the cover page, {{extending}} to the facing page is the <b>front</b> <b>endpaper</b> sometimes referred as FEP. The free half of the end paper is called a flyleaf. Traditionally, in hand-bound books, the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book. In modern publishing it can be either plain, as in many text-oriented books, or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as picture books, other children's literature, some arts and craft and hobbyist books, novelty/gift-market and coffee table books, and graphic novels. These books have an audience and traditions of their own where the graphic design and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important.The spine is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a bookshelf. It is customary for it to have printed text on it. In texts published and/or printed in the United States and the United Kingdom, the spine text, when vertical, runs from the top to the bottom, such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top. In books from continental Europe, vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up, though this convention has been changing lately. The spine usually contains all, or some, of four elements (besides decoration, if any), and in the following order: (1) author, editor, or compiler; (2) title; (3) publisher; and (4) publisher logo.|$|E
