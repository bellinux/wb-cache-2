5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Sh≈çichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 <b>formal</b> <b>adoption</b> of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E

50|$|Emar (modern Tell Meskene) is {{an archaeological}} site in Aleppo Governorate, {{northern}} Syria. It {{sits in the}} great bend of the mid-Euphrates, now on the shoreline of the man-made Lake Assad {{near the town of}} Maskanah.

In these texts, dating from the 14th century BC to the fall of Emar in 1187 BC, and in excavations in several campaigns since the 1970s, Emar emerges as an important Bronze Age trade center, occupying a liminal position between the power centers of Upper Mesopotamia and Anatolia-Syria. Unlike other cities, the tablets preserved at Emar, most of them in Akkadian and of the thirteenth century BC, are not royal or official, but record private transactions, judicial records, dealings in real estate, marriages, last wills, <b>formal</b> <b>adoptions.</b> In the house of a priest, a library contained literary and lexical texts in the Mesopotamian tradition, and ritual texts for local cults.|$|R
25|$|Bermuda, uniquely among British {{overseas}} territories, {{uses the}} Red Ensign as its land flag {{as well as}} at sea. The flag has apparently been flown unofficially since Bermuda's arms were granted in 1910. There appears to be no <b>formal</b> <b>adoption</b> of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 Foreign & Commonwealth Office circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship Sea Venture one mile off the coast of Bermuda in 1609. The ship struck a reef after being caught in a hurricane. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda's land flag due to Canadian influence. (In the early 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag). Bermuda's 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s. Bermuda (civil) Government vessels and maritime services use the defaced blue ensign, which is flown both from vessels and from shore facilities.|$|E

In this paper we use data on Thai listed firms to test whether firms with higher levels of good governance policy adoption are less likely to violate listing rules and laws put in place to protect shareholders. Our results suggest that Thai firms on average substantively, as opposed to symbolically, implement recommended governance policies, as violations occur less frequently among firms with higher levels of formal good governance policy adoption. However, we do find that the negative relation between <b>formal</b> policy <b>adoption</b> and subsequent violations is significantly weaker among smaller firms, less profitable firms and ‚Äútalk-only ‚Äù firms that issue policy statements about good governance while lagging in the adoption of policies related to shareholders rights and the Board of Directors...|$|R

50|$|<b>Formal</b> steps towards <b>adoption</b> of the West Syrian Rite came in 1772, when bishops {{visiting from}} Antioch consecrated Mar Thoma VI as Mar Dionysius I and {{established}} a systematic church hierarchy. Amid visits by a church prelate in 1846 and the Patriarch himself in 1875, the church fully adopted West Syrian practice. Following the splits within the Malankara Church in the 19th century and its final breakup in the 20th century, the churches that developed from it have retained the Malankara Rite. Today the rite is essentially West Syrian in character with some local variations, which sometimes retain elements now archaic in the wider West Syrian tradition. For example, the Malankara Rite includes the observance of the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts on weekdays during Great Lent and on the Friday of Passion Week. Since the 20th century Syriac has largely been replaced as the liturgical language by Malayalam.|$|R
40|$|Summary Objective: To {{provide a}} {{quantitative}} {{profile of the}} indications and use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in a developing country oncology-based institution. In addition, to describe the patients' and treatment characteristics, {{and to provide a}} temporal analysis. Method: SBRT patients treated from 2007 to 2015 were retrospectively evaluated by two independently investigators. Data were stratified and compared in two periods: first experience (FE) (May 2007 to April 2011), and following experience (FollowE) (May 2011 to April 2015). The following parameters were compared between the groups: total number of treated patients and lesions, treatment site, additional image fusion used, <b>formal</b> protocol <b>adoption,</b> and SBRT planning technique. Results: One hundred and seventy-six (176) patients with 191 lesions were treated: 34 (18 %) lesions in the FE and 157 (82 %) lesions in FollowE. The majority of lesions were metastases (60. 3 %), and lung (60. 2 %) was the most common treatment site, followed by spine (31 %), and others (8. 8 %). An average of 1. 4 (¬± 0. 6) additional imaging exams for delineation was performed. Conformal 3 D radiotherapy planning technique was used in 64. 4 %, and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the remaining 35. 6 % (p= 0. 0001). Higher rates of curative treatments were observed in FE, as well as more lung lesions, patients &# 8805; 70 years, 3 D conformal, number of additional images and ECOG 0, and all presented p< 0. 05.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{energy prices}} {{have led to}} a renewed {{interest}} in development of electric vehicles. At the same time, many customers may view an electric vehicle as an inferior alternative to the gasoline-powered car, due to limited range, length of time required to recharge the car, and limited availability of the related infrastructure. Further, commercially available and well-tested hybrid vehicle technology provides substantial fuel economy without requiring additional infrastructure investment; moreover, hybrid cars do not suffer from the range issue. This paper offers a first <b>formal</b> model of <b>adoption</b> of electric vehicles. We show that, depending on the values of the model's parameters, a situation can arise where some of the commuters purchase an electric vehicle as their second car, in addition to purchasing a regular gasoline-powered car. At the same time, improvements in fuel economy similar to development of a hybrid vehicle technology can lead to wide-spread adoption of a hybrid vehicle as household's only car. This paper will provide a framework model to analyze the question of electric vehicle adoption, which will be expanded in future research...|$|R
40|$|Scholarly {{study of}} the European Community (EC) has {{concentrated}} on the macrolevel process of regional integration {{to the neglect of}} its 'internal' policy processes. A newly emerging literature on EC public policy is beginning to address this imbalance, but it is largely focused on the development of policy outputs culminating in the adoption of policies by the Council of Ministers, rather than the long-term outcomes of policy at the national and subnational levels. This paper develops a multitheoretical framework and applies it to a case {{study of the}} implementation of the Directive on bathing water in the United Kingdom and France to reveal the sort of intriguing questions and puzzles which emerge in the 'postdecisional' phase of the EC policy process. The study draws comparisons between implementation in the two countries, showing that policy 'making' and retuning continued long after the <b>formal</b> point of <b>adoption.</b> As in national systems, policy implementation and the interpretation and evaluation of policy outcomes in the EC are just as much part of the political process as agenda setting and policy framing. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a large natural field {{experiment}} {{to identify the}} effects of formal savings on interhousehold transfers in villages, and the spillover impacts of service-expansion on de facto ineligibles residing in the same community. Despite widespread interest in microfinance, spillover effects on the very poor of expanding formal financial services remain largely unexplored. This study helps fill this gap by examining evidence from an experiment which uses an information intervention that mimics naturally-occurring institutions to increase <b>formal</b> service <b>adoption.</b> It also contributes to an emerging literature on the indirect impacts of policy interventions in developing countries, often evaluated {{solely on the basis}} of how they impact direct participants and beneficiaries. In developing regions, households vulnerable to extreme poverty often rely on local safety nets based on transfers from relatives and friends, which help them smooth consumption across food-deficits and household shocks. To date, little is known about how these pre-existing practices are affected as community members begin adopting newly available formal financial services. Using a panel dataset of over 2, 000 households collected during a rapid expansion of formal savings services in Central Malawi, this paper shows that experimentally boosting use of formal savings in rural areas sharply increases inter-household transfers during peak periods of hunger. The impact on transfer receipts is strongest among the poorest households, a de facto financial services-ineligible group, among whom the effects are also linked to significant changes in welfare. The strong impacts of formal savings expansion on non service-users suggests that formal finance can have much greater immediate-term effects than would be suggested by focusing exclusively on impacts experienced by service-users. The findings also highlight the sensitivity of traditional safety nets and welfare outcomes among the highly vulnerable in villages to expansion of formal financial markets. microfinance, formal savings, indirect effects, safety nets, poverty, food security...|$|R
