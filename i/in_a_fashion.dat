5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} {{a clear distinction}} between the real world and the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into the real world.|$|E

5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|Flocks in Australia {{have always}} been largely range bands on fenced land, and are aimed at {{production}} of medium to superfine wool for clothing and other products as well as meat. New Zealand flocks are kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to English ones, in fenced holdings without shepherds. Although wool was once the primary income source for New Zealand sheep owners (especially during the New Zealand wool boom), today it has shifted to meat production for export.|$|E
5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and {{discipline of the}} soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts {{go out to the}} families of the fallen soldiers.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E
5|$|Lappius Maximus {{received}} the governorship {{of the province}} of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had {{played a part in}} uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.|$|E
5|$|Nine Inch Nails {{frontman}} Trent Reznor {{announced in}} 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, Interscope Records, and {{would no longer}} be working with the company. He also revealed that the band would likely distribute its next album independently, possibly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to Saul Williams' 2007 album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, which Reznor produced.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|The wargames {{from which}} Dungeons & Dragons evolved used {{miniature}} figures to represent combatants. D initially continued {{the use of}} miniatures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to its direct precursors. The original D set of 1974 required {{the use of the}} Chainmail miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.|$|E

5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in germline cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.|$|E
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|At Rahul Arora's (Samir Soni) fashion show, Meghna meets supermodel Shonali Gujral (Kangana Ranaut) and is {{ridiculed}} by the show's choreographer, Christine, {{and told}} to have her portfolio photographed by Kartik (Rohit Roy). To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna shoots a lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Meghna's lingerie photos appear {{on the cover of}} a magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav. Meghna is noticed by Anisha Roy (Kitu Gidwani), an executive at Panache, a major modeling agency. Anisha introduces her to her superior, Abhijit Sarin (Arbaaz Khan), who is impressed by Meghna's ambition and confidence. Panache's top model is Shonali, but her drug abuse becomes problematic. Abhijit includes Meghna <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> show organised by Vinay Khosla, but is replaced after a misunderstanding. Abhijit consoles her, and decides to replace Shonali with Meghna as Panache's new top model.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{aboriginal}} peoples had {{systems of}} governance organised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> {{similar to the}} Occidental concept of monarchy; European explorers often referred to hereditary leaders of tribes as kings. The present monarchy of Canada {{has its roots in}} the French and English monarchies, under the authority of which the area was colonised in the 16th-18th centuries, and later the British monarchy. The country became a self-governing confederation on 1 July 1867, recognised as a kingdom in its own right, but did not have full legislative autonomy from the British Crown until the passage of the Statute of Westminster on 11 December 1931, retaining the then reigning monarch, George V, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of Canada. The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor General of Canada, Julie Payette, and in each of the provinces by a lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
