40|$|Objectives: Analysis of {{the effect}} of edelfosine, <b>ilmofosine</b> and {{miltefosine}} on Leishmania amazonensis and of potential targets of these lysophospholipid analogues. Methods: Quantification and ultrastructural analysis {{of the effect}} of lysophospholipid analogues on promastigote forms and on infected peritoneal macrophages, and flow cytometry analysis of treated promastigotes labelled with propidium iodide and rhodamine 123 (Rh 123). Results: The lysophospholipid analogues presented potent antiproliferative activity with IC 50 / 3 days of 1. 9 – 3. 4 mM for promastigotes and 4. 2 – 9. 0 mM for intracellular amastigotes. Treatment with these ana-logues in Schneider medium for 1 day led to a dose-dependent decrease in Rh 123 fluorescence, an effect more accentuated in edelfosine-treated parasites, suggesting interference with the potential of the mitochondrial membrane. In both forms of L. amazonensis, edelfosine induced extensive mito-chondrial damage, multinucleation and, in promastigotes, also led to plasma membrane alterations, formation of autophagic structures and membranous arrangements inside the flagellar pocket. Conclusions: The alkylglycerophosphocholines edelfosine and <b>ilmofosine</b> were more active than the alkylphosphocholine miltefosine against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonen-sis, and ultrastructural and flow cytometry data indicate the mitochondrion as a target of edelfosine...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} stress {{proteins}} induced in protozoa Leishmania donovani after treatment with edelfosine, miltefosine and <b>ilmofosine.</b> We studied the morphological and structural modifications caused in the promastigote {{forms of the}} parasite after treatment with the three alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALPs). A resistant strain of L. donovani to miltefosine was obtained and the morphological modifications were observed. The stress proteins induction was studied in promastigote forms and also in amastigote-like forms obtained in vitro. The proteins synthesized with the three alkyl-lysophospholipids were compared to those obtained by heat shock. The axenic amastigote forms synthesized a pattern of different proteins for those observed in the promastigote forms. The morphological alterations were observed under electronic microscopy. The membrane and mitochondria were the organs most affected by the three ALPs. We noted an apparition of vacuoles and vesicles in the treated promastigotes. In the resistant strain, we noted myelin bodies in the treated and untreated parasites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The anti-proliferative {{action of}} three alkyl-lysophospholipid derivatives, {{edelfosine}} (ET-OCH), miltefosine (Hexadecylphosphocholine), and <b>ilmofosine</b> (BM 14. 440) {{has been studied}} on the promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania donovani. The effect of the three drugs has previously been studied, but the action mode was not clearly elucidated. In this study {{the effect on the}} intracellular amastigote forms was evaluated by two different methods: the traditional method, counting the amastigotes within the macrophages stained with Giemsa; and by a new method, staining the nuclear macrophages and amastigotes with ethidium bromide and counting the different population by flow cytometry. This new method, based on the flow cytometry, shows an advantage for evaluating the anti-proliferative effects in intracellular parasites. The ED 50 were calculated for the drug activity after 72 hr, and for the three alkyl-lysophospholipid derivatives it were in the range of 26. 73 – 33. 31 mM against promastigotes and in the range of 16. 46 – 23. 16 against amastigotes. Also, studying the effect against macrophages J 774 A 1, the ED 50 were in the range of 24. 28 – 26. 38 mM. The effect of the alkyl-lysophospholipids in the macromolecular biosynthesis of the Leishmania donovani, was studied comparing th...|$|E
40|$|Activated T-cells {{constitute}} {{a target for}} treatment of autoimmune diseases. We {{have found that the}} antitumour ether phospholipid 1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-rac-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (ET- 18 -OCH 3; edelfosine) induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in human mitogen-activated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, but not in resting T-cells. T-lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin- 2 or with concanavalin A. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation through cell cycle and TUNEL analyses, as well as through visualization of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in agarose gels. The ET- 18 -OCH 3 -mediated apoptotic response in activated T-lymphocytes was less intense than in human leukaemic T cell lines, such as Jurkat cells and Peer cells; namely about 25 % apoptosis in activated T-cells versus about 46 – 61 % apoptosis in T leukaemic cells after 24 h treatment with 10 μM ET- 18 -OCH 3. The ET- 18 -OCH 3 thioether analogue BM 41. 440 (<b>ilmofosine)</b> showed a similar apoptotic capacity to that found with ET- 18 -OCH 3 in activated T-cells, whereas the phospholipid analogue hexadecylphosphocholine (miltefosine) failed to promote this response. The uptake of [3 H]-ET- 18 -OCH 3 was much larger in activated T-cells than in resting lymphocytes. Using a cytofluorimetric approach we have found that ET- 18 -OCH 3 induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species in activated T-cells, but not in resting lymphocytes. ET- 18 -OCH 3 induced an increase in Fas (APO- 1 /CD 95) ligand mRNA expression in activated T-cells, and incubation with a blocking anti-Fas (APO- 1 /CD 95) antibody partially inhibited the ET- 18 -OCH 3 -induced apoptosis of activated T-lymphocytes. These results demonstrate that mitogen-activated T-cells, unlike resting lymphocytes, are able to take up significant amounts of ET- 18 -OCH 3, and are susceptible to undergo apoptosis by the ether lipid via, in part, the Fas (APO- 1 /CD 95) receptor/ligand system. This ET- 18 -OCH 3 apoptotic action can be of importance in the therapeutic action of this ether lipid in certain autoimmune diseases.
