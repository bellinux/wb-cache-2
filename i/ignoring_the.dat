5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed.

5|$|In April 1997, Harper {{suggested}} that the Reform Party was drifting toward social conservatism and <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> principles of economic conservatism. The Liberal Party lost seats but managed to retain a narrow majority government in the 1997 federal election, while Reform made only modest gains.|$|E

We leave these questions for our future work.|$|R
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be based solely on the alternating segmental and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E
5|$|To {{the left}} of the elder Potocki, the seated primate of Poland, Michał Jerzy Poniatowski, is engaged in a {{conversation}} with the chancellor Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski, both <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> disruption.

5|$|Vito Zani {{pointed out}} in 2012 that the face of San Faustino is unfinished; it has been brought {{to a level of}} {{definition}} close to the sanding surface. These parts were not ground flat, but worked with a chisel directly, thereby <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> canonical technical process, and providing further evidence of the virtuosity of Gasparo Cairano in sculpting heads.|$|E

5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four {{other women in the}} locale. <b>Ignoring</b> <b>the</b> protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> {{threat posed by}} the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even {{trying to take the}} major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for the prosthetic makeup designs by Canonero, {{with whom they}} had worked on The Cotton Club (1984). The rogues gallery makeup designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception of}} Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own designs, <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> rather overweight character of the strip. His makeup took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|E

The Puyallup tribe of Washington were [...] "primarily a piscatory people".

Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side—the baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death.

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest.

Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> other individuals.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 1954 Sauk-Prairie Star editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin {{urged the}} recall of McCarthy in a front-page {{editorial}} that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's-own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.|$|E

As a result of the Gonzalez incident, and other controversies relating to the security of the White House, including the 2011 White House shooting, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
