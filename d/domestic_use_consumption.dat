40|$|Sustainability science {{explores the}} {{interactions}} between human activities on the Earth’s life support systems. Unless we understand these interactions, {{we will not be}} able to design a path towards sustainable development. In this report we focus our attention on water as key resource for human health and ecosystem health and as archetypal resource for which sustainability assessment is needed in order to preserve quality and quantity of the resource for present and future generations. A holistic approach to sustainability assessment of water requires different methodologies able to capture the magnitude of socio-economic drivers related to water consumption: both from production sectors (such as industries and agriculture) and from consumers (<b>domestic</b> <b>use,</b> <b>consumption</b> pattern). The present report aims at presenting different methodologies for depicting sustainability of water use in a life cycle thinking perspective. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E

40|$|Cholera is a {{water and}} food-borne {{infectious}} disease {{that continues to}} be a major public health problem in most Asian countries. However, reports concerning the incidence and spread of cholera in these countries are infrequently made available to the international community. Cholera is endemic in Sarawak, Malaysia. We report here the epidemiologic and demographic data obtained from nine divisions of Sarawak for the ten years from 1994 to 2003 and discuss factors associated with the emergence and spread of cholera and its control. In ten years, 1672 cholera patients were recorded. High incidence of cholera was observed during the unusually strong El Niño years of 1997 to 1998 when a very severe and prolonged drought occurred in Sarawak. Cholera is endemic in the squatter towns and coastal areas especially those along the Sarawak river estuaries. The disease subsequently spread to the rural settlements due to movement of people from the towns to the rural areas. During the dry seasons when tributary gravity fed tap waters cease to flow, rural communities rely on river water for <b>domestic</b> <b>use</b> for <b>consumption,</b> washing clothes and household utensils. Consequently, these practices facilitated the spread of water borne diseases such as cholera. The epidemiologic and demographic data were categorized according to ethnic group, gender, occupation, and age of the patients. Large outbreak...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to test the hypothesis: `Off-the-shelf {{domestic}} electricity meters can be utilised to assist in monitoring the wellbeing of elderly people` Many {{studies have shown that}} it is, in theory, possible to <b>use</b> <b>domestic</b> electricity <b>consumption</b> to determine `activities of daily living` but the availability of systems for actual use is very limited. This work followed the Design Science Research Methodology to create a Java application running on the Google App Engine cloud service that interfaced with both electricity meters and voice and text services. The system was implemented and tested over a three month period with one older person and their carer. Results demonstrated that the technology readily succeeds in meeting the study`s initial objectives. The need for more sophisticated decision logic was apparent and a method to determine whether a home is currently occupied is likely to improve the ability to create more timely alerts. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} ability of asset pricing models that do not <b>use</b> <b>consumption</b> data, and models that <b>use</b> <b>consumption</b> data {{as a proxy for}} true consumption, to explain the time-series and {{cross-sectional}} variation of expected returns of portfolios of stocks. Although some parameter restrictions are rejected by models that do not <b>use</b> <b>consumption</b> data, we find that they provide economically meaningful estimates of the representative agent's preference parameters and fit the data slightly better than models which <b>use</b> <b>consumption</b> data to proxy true consumption. Models without consumption data are also not rejected when they are augmented to account for the 'size' effect. Asset Pricing Models; Consumption; Size Effect...|$|R

In 2006, more than three quarters (76.8%) was used for agriculture, while public supply only used up 13.9%, the remainder being used by thermal power station (5.4%) and industry (3.8%).
