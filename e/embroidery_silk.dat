Only a little terrier came barking out into the dismal paved hall. Into every room they looked, the old woman asseverating denials that it was of no use, they might see for themselves, {{that no one had}} been there for years past. Full of emptiness, indeed, with faded grimy family portraits on the walls, moth-eaten carpets and cushions, high-backed chairs with worm-holes; and yet, somehow, there was one room that did look as if it had recently been sat in. Two little stools were drawn up close to a chair; the terrier poked and smelt about uneasily as though in search of some one, and dragged out from under a couch a child's ball which he began to worry. On the carpet, too, were some fragments of bright fresh <b>embroidery</b> <b>silk,</b> which the practiced eye of the constable noticed. [...] "This here was not left ten or a dozen years ago," [...] said he; and, extracting the ball from the fangs of the dog, [...] "No, and this ball ain't ten year old, neither.

50|$|Historic blackwork {{embroidery}} is rare to find well-preserved, as the iron-based dye {{used was}} corrosive to the thread, {{and there are}} currently no conservation techniques that can stop the decay.

50|$|Chinese {{embroidery}} has a {{long history}} since the Neolithic age. Because of the quality of silk fibre, most Chinese fine embroideries are made in silk.

Currently the earliest real sample of <b>silk</b> <b>embroidery</b> discovered in China is from a tomb in Mashan in Hubei province identified with the Zhanguo period (5th-3rd centuries BC). After the opening of Silk Route in the Han Dynasty, the silk production and trade flourished. In the 14th century, the Chinese <b>silk</b> <b>embroidery</b> production reached its high peak. Several major <b>silk</b> <b>embroidery</b> styles had been developed, like Song Jin (宋锦 Song embroidery) in Suzhou, Yun Jin (云锦 Cloud embroidery) in Nanjing and Shu Jin (蜀锦 Shu embroidery) in Sichuan.|$|R
