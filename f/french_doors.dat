5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} in double brick, {{and it is this}} unreinforced masonry construction that was unable to cope with the earthquake forces. Upstairs, windows were round-headed. Downstairs, many of the openings were <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second-floor balcony {{is framed}} on either end by pilasters {{decorated}} with candelabra. Each wall is angled inward by two bays, {{with one of}} the bays behind the balustrade. It is reached via <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> which are framed by slit windows on either side. Pilasters decorated with candelabra are set between the four windows and the doors. A circular escutcheon framed with fruit-and-drapery swags tops each bay and the <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> while fruit-and-drapery swags link the pilaters over the slit windows.|$|E
25|$|The {{third floor}} balcony is reached through <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> (framed with slit windows) as well. It {{features}} a low balustrade of turned granite interrupted by pedestals, which {{are decorated with}} variegated marble panels. The placement of the pedestals mimics the pillars and pilasters below. The two bay windows {{on either side of}} the balcony feature the same torches, swag, putti, panels, and molding similar to the rest of the third floor. Above the <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> is a large oval estucheon with fruit-and-drapery swag which mimics the estucheon over the doors to the loggia. A standing putto over each slit window supports the swag.|$|E

25|$|A garden door is any {{door that}} opens to a {{backyard}} or garden. This term {{is often used}} specifically for French windows, double <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> (with lites instead of panels), {{in place of a}} sliding glass door. The term also may refer to what is known as patio doors.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is reached by three limestone steps. The architrave {{of the entrance}} loggia is topped by a fruit-and-swag draped escutcheon. Smooth, variegated marble double-columns, topped by composite capitals, stand above the architrave. The entrance originally featured <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> but were replaced by black enameled doors decorative by bas-relief wreaths.|$|E
25|$|The shape, size, {{and style}} of windows and doors {{throughout}} the Washington Harbour complex were highly variable. Windows were single in some places, and horizontal ribbons in others. Wraparound windows often adorned corners, and sliding glass or <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> were sometimes used in place of windows. Windowsills, too, varied in color, height, material, shape, and style.|$|E
50|$|The western {{verandah}} has a stone paved floor, with timber posts {{supporting a}} skillion awning. A centrally positioned multi-paned <b>French</b> <b>door</b> with battered reveals and external timber shutters opens onto the verandah. A multi-paned casement window with external timber shutters is positioned above the <b>French</b> <b>door</b> and opens above the awning level. A plaque commemorating {{the construction of}} the building is hung on {{the southern end of the}} western wall, and the name 'Wiseman's Cottage' is located centrally hung from the verandah top- plate.|$|R
50|$|When Sathish agrees, Vijay {{explains}} {{his plan to}} murder Latha the following evening. His plan consists of taking Anand to a party while leaving Latha at home and hiding the latchkey outside {{the front door of}} their house. Sathish will then sneak in when Latha is asleep and hide behind the curtains in front of the <b>French</b> <b>door</b> to the gardens. At 10:50, Vijay will telephone the house from the party so that when she answers the phone, Sathish can kill Latha. He will then leave the <b>French</b> <b>door</b> open and exit through the front door, hiding the key again while leaving signs that suggests a burglary has gone wrong.|$|R
50|$|East of {{the blind}} middle bay is a one-story bay window with stone facing {{covering}} most of the brick. Its central facet has another, more deeply recessed <b>French</b> <b>door</b> with alternating long and short panes topped by a similar transom; the flanking facets have similar windows, shorter and narrower. Beneath them the brick is exposed. Another balustraded balcony rises above a damaged cornice; a <b>French</b> <b>door,</b> no longer present, provides access. In the middle bay is an elliptical window {{identical to the one}} in the second story of the west facade; the west bay has an intact casement with elongated middle and transom. Two dormers pierce the mansard on the attic level.|$|R
25|$|The builder L.H. Tiffany {{duplicated}} part of Charles A. Platt's {{original design}} {{for one of}} the gallery rooms. The Goodman Gallery is lower {{than the rest of the}} gallery, with steps leading down into it. Two sets of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> lead out to a balcony that once overlooked a lily pond. The entire Goodman Gallery is supported by 10â€“12 foot high stone piers. The Goodman Gallery primarily was constructed to allow space to exhibit drawings, sketches, and watercolors.|$|E
25|$|<b>French</b> <b>doors</b> {{are derived}} from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.|$|E
25|$|The central corps de logis {{is entirely}} {{taken up with}} the ballroom as it {{appeared}} on White's plans which, with the Louis XIV furniture removed, could serve as Newport's largest ballroom at 40 by 80 feet. Its scheme of single and paired Corinthian pilasters alternating with arch-headed windows and recessed doorways echoes the articulation of the exterior. This is reached through the <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> on either side, to a plain terrace dropping by broad stairs to the lawn facing the ocean, or to a planted terrace garden with a central fountain.|$|E
50|$|Frigidaire also {{produces}} {{a wide variety}} of refrigerators and freezers for the consumer market. Their model line-up includes refrigerator freezer units of several different types. The selection they offer includes traditional Top Freezer models, as well as more modern Side-By-Side and <b>French</b> <b>Door</b> styles.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{elevation}} has a <b>French</b> <b>door</b> as its entrance and a rectangular {{window in the}} gable apex. Inside, the rooms feature unpainted wooden trim and high ceilings. In the rear is a one-story gabled barn. It is considered a contributing resource to the NRHP listing.|$|R
50|$|The {{main house}} has a {{verandah}} on three sides, the rear verandah being enclosed. The front facade has a central doorway with a multi-paned <b>French</b> <b>door</b> on either side, opening onto the front verandah which has a sandstone step onto the footpath. The southern side abuts Meredith Lane.|$|R
25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
25|$|The Gregory Terrace Entry Building is a two-storey timber {{building}} with a brick extension, which forms part of the perimeter wall of the Showgrounds. The timber building has a gabled-hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheet. It has undergone changes, in particular at the ground floor level, which is now used as a space to park cars. The northwest external wall has been removed and replaced with three steel posts. The {{area in which the}} cars are parked has a pressed metal ceiling. At the first floor level the northwest veranda has been enclosed and extended and the roofline has been altered. The first level contained one large room, which has been subdivided with partitions. This room has six sets of <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> which open onto the enclosed veranda and six windows on the Gregory Terrace elevation. The room retains its pressed metal ceiling and fittings such as a row of coat hooks.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 1838 {{structure was}} relatively small; only two storeys tall with a full-height, central, curved bay, and an accordingly curved pediment on top, the villa {{was designed by}} Thomas McKay (who had also designed and built Earnscliffe) in a Regency style, inspired {{by the work of}} architect Sir John Soane, who had himself designed a never realised government house for the then capital of Upper Canada, York, in 1818. Unlike the present arrangement, the rooms of the McKay villa for entertaining, sleeping, and service were dispersed throughout the two floors of the structure, with the main parlour located on the second level, in an oval room behind the curved, south bay, which National Capital Commission Chief Architect David Scarlett said in 2014 was made in such a shape so as to display the advanced abilities of McKay's stonemasons. The main entrance to the house was on the west side and opened into a hall with stairs to the upper floor directly ahead. Along the south front were a library, a dining room, and a boudoir, all with <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> opening onto a narrow balcony; the dining room was served by three of these doors, one of which now opens into the Tent Room's antechamber, one into the Long Gallery, and one that still opens to the outside. The French door originally opening from the boudoir is today the window of the Pauline Vanier Room.|$|E
50|$|In mid 2015 Keurig debuted the K200, {{a smaller}} Keurig 2.0 model that can brew single cups or four-cup carafes {{and comes in}} a variety of colors. General Electric {{announced}} that its new CafÃ© <b>French</b> <b>Door</b> refrigerator, due out in late 2015, will have a Keurig coffee machine built into the door.|$|R
50|$|Extensions to the {{building}} were carried out in 1982, when {{the building}} was occupied by Cleary and Lee Solicitors. Extensions included placing a second entrance, a <b>French</b> <b>door</b> bordered by Doric pilasters, {{on the western side}} of the main entry. Part of the fence along Russell Street was demolished, following extensions {{to the building}}, to provide for a parking area.|$|R
50|$|Above {{the main}} door is a double <b>French</b> <b>door</b> with transom windows which opens onto {{the second floor of}} the veranda. The door is flanked by two windows that match the lower windows. A hipped roof tops the main block of the house and is pierced by three dormer windows. Two large brick {{chimneys}} sit to either side of the main part of the house.|$|R
500|$|The {{building}} {{has had some}} modifications and additions, made principally during the Lowell ownership period. [...] Additions housing more modern services and a library {{were added to the}} west side of the house, and first-floor windows in the front parlor and dining room were replaced with <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b> [...] A one-story porch with balustraded roof deck was added on the north side of the house, and a terrace was installed on the south side. [...] The Lowells decorated the house in a Victorian style; Harvard restored the building interior to an 18th-century style when it took over the property.|$|E
500|$|The Ellwood House {{living room}} {{did not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The {{original}} living room space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In the living room, a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's living room was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> from both {{the living room and}} sunroom. The living room was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The living room features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme. The large, Caen stone [...] fireplace was carved in Chicago in 1911. The sunroom was designed in the late 19th century and early 20th century Arts and Crafts style causing it to stand {{in stark contrast to the}} living room. The room was originally furnished with Mission style furniture to complement the oak woodwork.|$|E
500|$|Asher {{produced}} {{and directed the}} episode. A high school student who was granted the role of assistant director at one point screamed [...] "Quiet on the set!", a memory that Sargent later recalled fondly. For the scene in which Samantha casts a spell that makes Mr. Brockway see everyone as having black skin, the white actors, including Sargent and White, appeared in blackface. The name of Mr. Brockway's toy company is never mentioned. Samantha's statement {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "We're having integrated turkey: white meat and dark", was repeated in Spike Lee's 1986 film She's Gotta Have It. The final shot of the episode, which zooms out from the scene of Samantha and Darrin kissing to reveal the <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> at the back of their house as [...] "Silent Night" [...] plays in the background, is the only shot in any episode of Bewitched to depict the interior of the house from the perspective of the backyard. [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is the only episode of the series in which Lisa appears. Seven years before acting together in [...] "Sisters at Heart", Montgomery and Baer appeared together in an episode of the CBS television series Rawhide called [...] "Incident at El Crucero", which aired when the pilot episode of Bewitched was in pre-production. In 1970, Montgomery appeared on The Merv Griffin Show to promote [...] "Sisters at Heart", thereby making one of the only three talk show appearances of her career. After Griffin left the network, CBS wiped all episodes of The Merv Griffin Show produced between 1969 and 1972, but a copy of the episode featuring Montgomery's promotion of [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] was later discovered when it became known that relevant kinescopes and master tapes had survived.|$|E
50|$|In March 2015, it {{launched}} the K-Mug pod, a recyclable pod which brews large travel mug-sized portions. In mid 2015 Keurig debuted the K200, a smaller Keurig 2.0 model that can brew single cups or four-cup carafes {{and comes in}} a variety of colors. General Electric announced that its new CafÃ© <b>French</b> <b>Door</b> refrigerator, due out in late 2015, will have a Keurig coffee machine built into the door.|$|R
50|$|The two {{northern}} bays of {{the east}} (front) facade are given over to the main entrance portico. Four clusters of paired round fluted Ionic columns, with the two on the sides having a third, topped by a classical entablature and frieze, support a flat roof with iron balustrade. A Palladian-style window, with <b>French</b> <b>door,</b> opens on to the balcony. Above it on the third story is a blind bay.|$|R

2500|$|The lobby was {{converted}} into a chapel {{with the addition of}} <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> and stained-glass windows.|$|E
2500|$|The downstairs {{consisted}} of a parlor, dining room, central hallway, and two bedrooms. [...] Both the parlor and the front bedroom had <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> that opened onto the porch. [...] The upstairs had four small bedrooms, each with a dormer. [...] Classical wood columns supported the porch roof, and a white picket fence surrounded the house. [...] A detached brick kitchen was in the rear, and {{on either side of}} the house were [...] garden plots. [...] Williams estimated that the house cost $7,472.|$|E
2500|$|Access to {{the main}} {{entrance}} to the house from the front street, and leading to the second level of the north elevation, is by way of either of two semi-circular stairways which run from the covered carriage entrance on the ground level of the north elevation. [...] This leads to double <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> which open into a large vestibule reception area with a ceramic tile floor. The view from this room reveals an open courtyard patio with a fountain. [...] The formal living room is located {{to the left of}} the vestibule. The living room is the only room with a parquet floor.|$|E
50|$|On {{the west}} side the main block gives way to a stone-faced section {{centered}} on a two-story trapezoidal bay window, topped by a balustraded balcony accessed from a clerestory. The first story of the bay has a narrow <b>French</b> <b>door</b> {{at the top of}} stone steps flanked by two similar windows, all topped with a transom of three panes per window. On the facets and either side of the bay are similar single-pane windows with four-pane transoms.|$|R
50|$|The thief, {{carrying}} an automatic pistol, entered the salon through a <b>french</b> <b>door,</b> {{which might have}} been forced or left open, and picked up a sack containing 72 jewels, 34 of which have been described as exceptional, in a suitcase. The heist has been called the biggest heist ever in France, and possibly the biggest heist of all time. The theft was at the same hotel where Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film To Catch a Thief was set.|$|R
50|$|Fenestration is regular in placement, {{with one}} window per bay on each story, and treatment, with all windows in quoined stone {{surrounds}} and splayed stones with a keystone atop the lintel. Otherwise it is irregular, with each opening set differently. The southern pavilion has a wooden <b>French</b> <b>door</b> {{topped with a}} two-light transom. A small step protrudes at floor level. The side quoining continues up to the mid-facade water table, enclosing a slightly raised stone panel with a carved foliate design.|$|R
