5|$|After these {{experimental}} killings, Nebe {{thought of}} remodelling a vehicle with a hermetically sealed cabin for killing. The carbon monoxide from the vehicle's exhaust would be channelled into the sealed cabin {{in which the}} victims stood. He discussed {{the technical aspects of}} the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> a specialist from Kripo's Technology Institute and together they brought the proposal before Heydrich, who adopted it.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2017, Israeli {{start-up}} Corephotonics sued Apple. They {{claimed that}} the technology behind the dual-camera systems in Apple's iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus infringed four patents owned by them (Corephotonics). Corephotonics said that they approached Apple over a possible partnership, but Apple's lead negotiator apparently declined the <b>idea,</b> <b>with</b> Apple going ahead and launching the iPhone 7 Plus in late 2016, and then the 8 Plus in late 2017.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{game was}} prototyped {{in a single}} night, but the team spent over half a year iterating through {{variations}} on the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> visual themes such as sushi and chess.

5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> each successive phrase of text.|$|E
5|$|Any large {{project was}} further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi {{served as a}} major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was {{captured}} and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi had been planning {{a trip to the}} United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.|$|E
5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E
5|$|The episode's script {{went through}} several {{different}} versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The decision to kill off the character of Catherine Black {{was based on a}} suggestion by Chris Carter, the series' creator. Morgan and Wong discussed the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> actress Megan Gallagher, who felt that it was an interesting decision to have Catherine give her life after seeing Frank Black sacrifice so much for their family throughout the previous episodes. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only {{significant}} other fourth move is 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position. Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E

5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the team {{intended}} to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as , was released in 2005, {{four years after the}} game's initial release. The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With {{the release of}} a new generation of hardware including a new Xbox console, Elites release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (<b>IDEA)</b> <b>with</b> Black Element Software and Altar Games. The organization aimed at supporting other independent game development studios with services including marketing support and negotiation with publishers.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this <b>idea,</b> <b>with</b> fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the <b>idea</b> <b>with</b> coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E
