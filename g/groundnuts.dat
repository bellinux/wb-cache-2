He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and <b>groundnuts.</b> He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, <b>groundnuts,</b> palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, <b>groundnuts,</b> and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, <b>groundnuts,</b> coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara <b>groundnuts</b> known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, <b>groundnuts,</b> vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{requirements}} and utilization of mineral nitrogen (N) by sorghum and <b>groundnut</b> were compared. At the maximum N use level, sorghum genotypes showed greater N use efficiency (120 kg biomass/kg N harvested) than <b>groundnut</b> genotypes (36 kg biomass/kg N harvested). Using a non-nodulating <b>groundnut</b> genotype (Non-nod) or sorghum as controls for soil N uptake, {{the amounts of}} N 2 fixed by the nodulated <b>groundnut</b> genotypes were estimated to be 183 – 190 kg N/ha. Nitrogen fertilization increased harvest index and percentage N translocated to seeds in sorghum genotypes, but decreased harvest index and had variable effects on percentage N translocated to seed in <b>groundnut</b> genotypes. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and nitrate content in the leaves of two sorghum genotypes, one nodulating, and ‘Non-nod’ <b>groundnut</b> genotypes were also compared. The concentration of nitrate was lower in sorghum than in <b>groundnut</b> leaves, but NRA was higher in sorghum. It is suggested that either NRA in the <b>groundnut</b> leaves has relatively lower affinity for the substrate (higher Km, the Michaelis-Menton constant) or higher nitrate {{is required for the}} induction of nitrate reductase in <b>groundnut</b> than in sorghum. This implies that <b>groundnut</b> is a poor utilizer of fertilizer nitrogen...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} <b>groundnut</b> production in Bangladesh in the 1990 s and 2000 s, both at the district and national level. Production performance was {{measured in terms of}} growth and variability. Annual compound rate of growth was estimated to know the growth performance. Cuddy-Della Valle index was used to estimate variability. Analysis showed that both area and production of <b>groundnut</b> at the national level declined in the 1990 s but production increased afterwards. In the late 2000 s, <b>groundnut</b> production increased by 31 % although area under <b>groundnut</b> was same as in the late 1990 s. Increase in <b>groundnut</b> yield (by 373 kg/ha or 32 %) contributed towards increase in <b>groundnut</b> production in the late 2000 s. In the late 2000 s (TE 2009 / 10), top five <b>groundnut</b> producing districts (Noakhali, Dhaka, Faridpur, Kishoreganj and Pabna) accounted for 59 percent of area and 55 percent of production. In the 2000 s, Bangladesh achieved high annual growth (5. 0 % or more) in <b>groundnut</b> production at the national level and in nine districts (Faridpur, Tangail, Barisal, Jessore, Kushtia, Dinajpur, Pabna, Rangpur and Chittagong H. T.). On the other hand, variability in <b>groundnut</b> production in the 2000 s increased insignificantly at the national level while three districts (Sylhet, Mymensingh and Tangail) experienced statistically significant increase in variability in <b>groundnut</b> production. Increase in variability in <b>groundnut</b> production was mainly due to the increased variability in area under <b>groundnut</b> indicating that the crop was expanded to less suitable areas. The study concludes that <b>groundnut</b> breeders should focus more on yield increase rather than on reduction in variability in yield. Increase in yield potential through research is expected to have higher production and profit to the farmers and thereby, encourage farmers to allocate more area under <b>groundnut</b> cultivation...|$|R
