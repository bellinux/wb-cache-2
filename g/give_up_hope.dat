5|$|Though Wiggins did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for {{a return}} to baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E

25|$|Aizawl {{had a dream}} run in the Federation Cup {{before they}} made it to their first ever final. In the quarter final encounter, they were first up at home against the {{recently}} crowned I-League champions Bengaluru FC. Bengaluru FC opened the scoring in the 15th minute thanks to a strike from midfield general Eugeneson Lyngdoh. Aizawl however did not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> and drew level terms in the 38th minute from an Alfred Jaryan strike. In the final minutes of regulation time, it was striker Joel Sunday who gave Aizawl the illusive winning goal. This result meant that although Bengaluru FC had an away goal in their kitty, it was Aizawl who walked the stronger, being a goal to the good before the return leg quarter final encounter.|$|E

Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you're supposed to love your enemy. That really impressed me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] The way that I view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing.

Only one man responded to the ads, a Croatian-American named Anthony Francis Lucas. Lucas signed agreements with the Gladys City Company and also with Higgins in 1899, and in June of the following year, he began to drill. The first well Lucas made with his light equipment collapsed after reaching [...] This failure exhausted the partners' finances, so Lucas turned to John H. Galey and James M. Guffey in Pittsburgh for backing. The terms set forth by Guffey (who held and controlled the funds) limited Lucas’ percentage cut to a small amount, and eliminated Higgins and cut him completely from the deal.|$|E

However, disaster strikes when Altares is caught in the gravity {{of a black hole}} that has formed from a collapsed star. The photon drive is unable to provide the faster-than-light speeds necessary to break free; nevertheless, Anna urges the crew not to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope,</b> for she suspects that the object may be a gateway to another universe. Her theory is proven correct when, sustaining the various space-time distortions at the event horizon, Altares safely emerges from the black hole – intact, albeit with no way of returning to Earth. As the vessel and its intrepid crew approach a planet, the narrator concludes, [...] "One thing is sure – this is not the final word. Not the end, but the beginning. A new universe, a new hope? Only time will tell." ...|$|E

[...] Her father refused to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> that Charlotte would agree to marry the Prince of Orange. [...] However, Charlotte wrote, [...] "No arguments, no threats, shall ever bend me to marry this detested Dutchman." [...] Faced with the united {{opposition}} of the Royal Family, George finally gave in and dropped the idea of marriage to the Prince of Orange, who became engaged to Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia that summer. [...] Charlotte contacted Leopold through intermediaries, and found him receptive, but with Napoleon renewing the conflict on the Continent, Leopold was with his regiment fighting. [...] In July, shortly before returning to Weymouth, Charlotte formally requested her father's permission to marry Leopold. [...] The Prince Regent replied that with the unsettled political situation on the Continent, he could not consider such a request. [...] To Charlotte's frustration, Leopold did not come to Britain after the restoration of peace, even though he was stationed in Paris, which she deemed to be only a short journey from Weymouth or London.|$|E

She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, my memories of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human and someday my memories will grow dimmer. I don't want to lose my memories of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living told me that it helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully. Even when her time was limited, she didn't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> and lived diligently, and I wanted to let people know of Jin-young's passionate life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began to}} write again in 1847. His first work in this period was Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits which {{was made up of}} three parts. It {{included}} Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. These questions are asked, What {{does it mean to be}} a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains that these are not [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote [...] discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.
