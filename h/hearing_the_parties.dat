2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{in most cases}} was the so-called rolprocedure (after the rol (roll of paper or parchment) on which the particulars of the cases were entered during the rolzitting (audience), which took place weekly on Monday before two councillors, taking turns, in the Rolzaal of the Binnenhof at The Hague where the Hof sat since 1511). A case was initiated by a petition for a mandement van dagvaarding (writ of civil summons) by an impetrant (plaintiff). This was executed by a deurwaarder (bailiff) to summon the gedaagde (defendant) to appear on a specific date at the audience, where the sollicitor of the plaintiff handed over a conclusie van eis ( [...] comparable to a complaint) as the first pleading. These were followed by further written pleadings: conclusie van antwoord (counter-plea), conclusie van repliek (reply), and conclusie van dupliek (rejoinder) on successive audiences. These four pleadings could be augmented by other documents of all kinds after special petitions (rekest civiel) from the parties had obtained leave to do this. At a certain point {{there were no more}} documents to exchange and parties would enter a final pleidooi (closing argument) and ask for justice in a conclusie in rechte. If the parties contradicted each other on the facts the court could order an enqueste (evidentiary hearing) before a commissaris (one of the councillors appointed as commissioner). In such a <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> and witnesses would be interrogated under oath. Finally, the case would be summed up in the rapport by another councillor, the rapporteur, for the full court to deliberate. The court decided by majority vote. Minority opinions were not published. In case the vote was a draw the complaint was rejected. The final verdict (dictum) was read at an audience (not before all fees were paid) and the written verdict with the opinion on which it was based were handed to the triumfant party.|$|E

He sometimes cuts the tension in his courtroom-even tension he himself has fostered-with wisecracks or taunting remarks. Mathis has bantered directly at audience members on occasion, resulting in audience laughter. He also calls attention to peculiarities or juicy details exposed {{throughout the course of}} the proceedings as a means of making the cases more interesting to the viewers. He also uses a high pitched voice to suggest that certain litigants have not recognized the obvious.|$|E

The court also formed a high-level committee under chairmanship of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Uttar Pradesh {{to report on}} the directions issued in the judgment. The members filed a review petition against the judgment passed by the Tribunal, following which the court gave a direction on 7 July 2015 that This Application is disposed of with an observation that upon filing of the report by High Power Committee; constituted under the Judgment of the Tribunal, the Tribunal will pass further directions after <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> in regard to all matters as mentioned in the Judgment including Environmental Clearance and Forest Clearance. The Tribunal through its order dated 21 September 2015 issued a show cause notice to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Uttar Pradesh for not submitting the report within the deadline. In one of the article published by Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan on its portal in December, 2015 states that the petitioners are unsatisfied with the report submitted by the committee and alleged that the State government is violating the judgment passed by the Tribunal in its 7 May 2015 order.|$|E
50|$|Legal {{representation}} is not permitted, except when special permission is granted {{in cases where}} the dispute raises complex questions of law. The written procedure is simplified.

They provide each party with fair and impartial assistance, so as to render the substantive law effective and ensure that it is carried out. Where circumstances allow, the judges endeavour to bring <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> to an agreement. When judgment is rendered, it is a reasoned decision and cannot be appealed. Judges in this division also decide tax-related summary appeals.|$|R

50|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an order}} {{made by the}} court to stop a public body from acting in an unlawful way.

If an interim injunction is granted pending final hearing, {{it is possible that}} the side which benefits from the injunction will be asked to give an undertaking that if the other side is successful at <b>the</b> final <b>hearing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> which had <b>the</b> benefit of the interim protection can compensate <b>the</b> other <b>party</b> for its losses.

60|$|Once out of <b>hearing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{broke into}} hurried comment and {{criticism}} of the scene they had just witnessed, and particularly of the fair actress who had played so important a part, averring their emphatic intention of wresting the facts from Yuba Bill at once, and cross-examining him closely; but oddly enough, reaching the coach and that redoubted individual, {{no one seemed to}} care to take the initiative, and they all scrambled hurriedly to their seats without a word. How far Yuba Bill's irritability and imperious haste contributed to this, or a fear that he might in turn catechise them kept them silent, no one knew.

5000|$|The writ of audita querela defendentis (Law Latin for [...] "the {{complaint}} {{the defendant}} been heard"), later shortened to audita querela, (Law Latin for [...] "the complaint been heard") was first authorized by Parliament in 1336, {{during the reign}} of Edward III, and may have existed as early as 1282. The writ would issue from the Court of Chancery, directed towards either the King's Bench or the Court of Common Pleas, and would direct <b>the</b> court to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> and [...] "do speedy justice to the debtor". In the Middle Ages, the writ became a general remedy for victims of forgery and similar issues, which development led to the importation of the writ to the United States. The writ was used to vacate a judgment rendered against a debtor where that debtor had paid the debt or the debt had otherwise been discharged. This was to ensure that a creditor could not collect the same debt twice.|$|R
