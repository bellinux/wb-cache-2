50|$|Monoammonium phosphate, ABC <b>Dry</b> <b>Chemical,</b> ABE Powder, tri-class, or {{multi-purpose}} <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> is a <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> {{extinguishing agent}} used on class A, class B, and class C fires. It uses a specially fluidized and siliconized monoammonium phosphate powder. ABC <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> {{is usually a}} mix of monoammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfate, the former being the active one. The mix between the two agents is usually 40-60%, 60-40%, or 90-10% depending on local standards worldwide. The USGS uses a similar mixture, called Phos Chek G75F.|$|R
25|$|Foam-compatible, {{which is}} a sodium {{bicarbonate}} (BC) based <b>dry</b> <b>chemical,</b> was developed for use with protein foams for fighting class B fires. Most <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the foam blanket created by protein (animal) based foams. Foam compatible type uses silicone as a waterproofing agent, which does not harm foam. Effectiveness is identical to regular <b>dry</b> <b>chemical,</b> and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are blue). This agent is generally no longer used since most modern <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> are considered compatible with synthetic foams such as AFFF.|$|R
40|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{discussed}} here {{are seen as}} having a greater weight effectiveness than the halons in current use for controlling fuel-leak fires, especially {{in the presence of}} high airflow rates. The commercial <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> K 2 CO 3, KHCO 3, and KC 2 N 2 H 3 O 3 are found to be more effective than CF 2 ClBr and CF 3 Br in delaying the hot-surface reignition of fuel-leak fires after initial extinguishment. Experimental <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> formulations of potassium dawsonite, KAl(OH) 2 CO 3, and of KCl and KI are seen as being even more weight effective than the above-mentioned commercial <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals.</b> It is noted, however, that the suitability and effectiveness of <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> in controlling engine nacele fires has not yet been demonstrated in test aircraft...|$|R
25|$|Potassium {{chloride}} {{was once}} {{used as a}} fire extinguishing agent, used in portable and wheeled fire extinguishers. Known as Super-K <b>dry</b> <b>chemical,</b> it was more effective than sodium bicarbonate-based <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> and was compatible with protein foam.

It is the only <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> fire suppression agent recognized by the U.S. National Fire Protection Association for firefighting at airport crash rescue sites. It is about twice as effective in fire suppression as sodium bicarbonate.|$|R

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>dust</b> palliatives {{have been}} used for decades to reduce the harmful or impeding effects of {{airborne}} dust on vehicle maneuvers. Improvements in the efficiency of these products have derived from increasing market potential as environmental regulations have tightened for air quality compliance. The research described herein was dedicated to quantifying the performance of traditional, newly developed, and experimental <b>chemical</b> <b>dust</b> palliatives. Data were analyzed from four field test locations to determine the effectiveness and durability of these dust palliatives. Two field tests were conducted in Yuma, AZ to evaluate performance under rotary-wing aircraft landings in an arid environment. Additional testing in an arid environment was conducted in Douglas, AZ for mitigating dust on unpaved roads. A final test was conducted at Ft. Leonard Wood, MO {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>dust</b> palliatives in a temperate climate. A particulate monitoring system was used to quantify the amount of dust generated from treated soil on test sections when controlled traffic was applied during each field test. Additional soil testing aided researchers in understanding the phenomenon of dust generation and the interaction of <b>chemical</b> <b>dust</b> palliative with the soil. Results from these tests were used to develop a decision-aid for selecting and applying products for dust mitigation...|$|R

50|$|Compared to gaseous suppressants, which emit only gas, and <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> {{suppression}} agents, {{which are}} powder-like particles {{of a large}} size (25-150 micrometres), condensed aerosols are defined by the National Fire Protection Association as releasing finely-divided solids of less than 10 micrometres in diameter. The solid particulates have a considerably smaller mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) than those of <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> suppression agents, remain airborne significantly longer, and leave much less residue within the protected area. Whereas <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> systems must be directly aimed at the flame, condensed aerosols are flooding agents and therefore effective regardless of the location and height of the fire. Wet chemical systems, such as the kind generally found in foam extinguishers, must, similarly to <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> systems, be sprayed directionally onto the fire. The condensed aerosol agent can be delivered by means of mechanical operation, electric operation, or combined electro-mechanical operation.|$|R

It has about 4-5 times more effectiveness against class B fires than carbon dioxide, and more than twice that of sodium bicarbonate. Some fire extinguishers are capable of operation in temperatures down to −54 °C or up to +49 °C. <b>Dry</b> <b>chemical</b> works by directly inhibiting the chemical chain reaction which forms one of the four sides of the fire tetrahedron (heat + oxygen + fuel + chemical chain reaction = fire).
