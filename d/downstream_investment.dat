40|$|This paper {{examines}} innovating firms’ {{incentives to}} engage in defensive patenting. It first establishes a “truce equilibrium” in patent enforcement: when litigation is costly, the equal strength of two symmetric parties’ patent portfolios deters any patent disputes along the equilibrium path. This equilibrium behavior generates two benefits of defensive patenting, namely, to prevent licensing outlays and to protect <b>downstream</b> <b>investments.</b> In addition, firms can use patents to coordinate non-contractible investment decisions. Depending on the joint interests, they can either reach a license in order to guarantee high investment incentives, or agree not to grant a license so that investments are deterred by the litigation threat. On the other hand, the strategic patenting concern may generate a bandwagon of patent accumulation, where firms rush to the patent office to get a patent, but the subsequent investment performance {{is the same as}} when there is no patent at all. The paper also argues that defensive patenting may weaken the effectiveness of patents as an appropriation scheme. This offers an explanation that the “pro-patent” policy shift in the United States since the 1980 s may actually have undermined the incentive power of the patent system. ...|$|R

Regulatory directives and resolutions, {{as well as a}} number of key policy decisions and new business strategies, will further define how the new structures come together. Within this context, it will be the behaviour of the incumbent monopoly, and of new players, that will determine industry dynamics. Public interest in Mexican energy reform has focused on the opening of the upstream to international industry. This is understandable given the expectation of important investment flows and the continuing decline of oil production. However, it is still too early to forecast the magnitude of capital flows associated with Round 1 upstream auctions and farmouts, or the time profile of incremental production and eventual government oil revenues. Recent government medium-term oil revenue projections to 2020 are based on questionable assumptions and unwarranted optimism, even if Round 1 is successful.

40|$|This paper explores how a {{principal}} with time-inconsistent preferences invests optimally in technology or capital. If the current principal prefers her future self to save more, she can increase current investments complementary to future savings and decrease {{investments in the}} strategic substitutes, for example. To characterize the principal's choices they are compared to a market equilibrium where the investors are private agents. Each investing agent applies the same discount factors as do the principal and he obtains full property rights to the future returns. With geometric discounting, {{there would be no}} need to regulate (subsidize/tax) these agents. With time-inconsistent preferences, however, the current principal benefits from subsidizing investments in green capital (complementary to future savings) and tax investments in substitute capital such as brown technology and even adaptation technology. The paper can thus compare policies for different types of investments at the same level in the production hierarchy, but investments at different levels are also compared. With quasi-hyperbolic discounting, the optimal subsidy is unrelated to this level. With discount rates that are strictly decreasing in relative time, however, upstream <b>investments</b> (needed for <b>downstream</b> <b>investments)</b> will optimally be subsidized at a higher rate. When applied to environmental policy, the paper provides a new rationale for subsidizing green (and taxing brown) technology unrelated to the traditional motivation emphasizing public good aspects...|$|R

We consider an industry where the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm 8 ̆ 5 rst chooses {{the size of a}} network, while several downstream rms then compete in selling goods and services that use this network as a necessary input. We contrast the (socially) optimal allocation with several equilibrium situations, depending on whether the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm owns zero, one or two downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms. The 8 ̆ 5 rst situation corresponds to ownership unbundling between upstream and downstream parts of the market. As for the other two cases, we equate legal unbundling with the following two assumptions. First, each downstream 8 ̆ 5 rm maximizes its own pro 8 ̆ 5 t, without taking into account any impact on the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rms pro 8 ̆ 5 t. Second, the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm is not allowed to discriminate between downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms by charging di¤erent access charges for the use of its network. On the other hand, we assume that the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm chooses its network size in order to maximize its total pro 8 ̆ 5 t, including the pro 8 ̆ 5 t of its downstream subsidiaries. Our main results are as follows. Because the investment in the network is not protected, at the time at which it is made, by a contract, the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm will {{not take into account the}} interests of its clients when choosing its size. This e¤ect can be mitigated by allowing it to own part of the downstream industry. In other words, ownership separation is more detrimental to welfare than legal unbundling. We also obtain that these results are robust to the introduction of asymmetry in network needs across downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms, imperfect downstream competition and <b>downstream</b> <b>investments.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a supply}} chain, {{investments}} that a rm makes in reducing its own variable costs provide an obvious benet to its suppliers: All else being equal, lower marginal costs cause the rm {{to increase its}} own output, hence increasing consumption of suppliers' outputs. Without pre-commitment to wholesale prices from its supplier(s), a rm will tend to underinvest in cost reduction because of fear of being held-up. Clearly, a supplier to such a rm can eliminate this hold-up problem by pre-committing, instead of remaining exible with respect to wholesale price. However, by making an advance commitment to wholesale price, it gives up an important means of responding to demand uncertainty. In this paper we examine the trade-o that is faced by a rm when its downstream channel partner has opportunities to invest in making relationship specic marginal cost reductions.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{international}} {{oil prices have}} highlighted the issue of petroleum product pricing reforms {{in a number of}} non-OECD economies, particularly as the non-OECD now accounts for the bulk of the global growth in consumption of petroleum products. In 2014, oil demand from the non-OECD is predicted to overtake OECD oil demand for the very first time. Of this, four economies – Brazil, Russia, India, and China, the ‘BRIC’ countries – will account for 45 per cent of non-OECD oil demand. The BRIC countries have some common socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and face similar challenges in domestic energy policy. One significant common policy stance has been associated with petroleum product pricing – specifically, the historical use of price controls, together with efforts to reform these over time. The most interesting feature of this shared policy stance is that it has led to different outcomes in the BRIC economies, particularly in relation to the impacts on <b>downstream</b> <b>investment.</b> This paper investigates the impacts of gasoline and diesel pricing reforms on <b>downstream</b> <b>investment</b> in the BRICs. Of the BRICs, India and China (the two countries that are the largest net importers of oil) have accounted for the largest downstream investments and expansions in refining capacity. However, these are also the two BRICs where price controls for petroleum products have been largely retained by governments, which have preferred a gradual approach towards the liberalization of prices. In contrast, Brazil and Russia, where petroleum product prices were officially liberalized in the early 1990 s and early 2000 s, have experienced serious constraints in attracting downstream investments and have struggled to expand (in the case of Brazil) or upgrade (in the case of Russia) their refining capacity. These outcomes run counterintuitive to expectation, according to which liberalization and the alignment of domestic petroleum product prices with international oil prices should be conducive to fostering competition and investment along the entire value chain. In investigating the reasons for this counterintuitive outcome, an analysis of the ‘pass-through’ of international price movements to domestic prices for gasoline and diesel shows broad evidence of price controls being exercised in Brazil and Russia despite the official liberalization of prices, through implicit or indirect measures, with governments typically influencing domestic pricing through intervention in the operations and capital expenditure plans of the National Oil Companies (NOCs). In contrast, India and China have used explicit or direct measures such as setting prices directly, adjusting federal taxes, and compensating NOCs and marketing/retailing companies, as well as specific consumer groups affected by price changes directly using cash transfers. The findings therefore demonstrate a dichotomy of experience amongst the BRICs. This paper sets out three broad policy lessons – first, that the impacts of price controls generally tend to be concentrated {{in one part of the}} value chain, and although governments may view this as ‘manageable’ or ‘containable’ – these impacts have knock-on effects, as shown in this paper. Second, that petroleum product price liberalization is not irreversible – demonstrated by the experiences of Brazil and Russia where price controls were reintroduced implicitly. And third, that there is a need, post-liberalization, for policies and price adjustment mechanisms which are logical and transparent, and which take into account the potentially negative impacts of price controls on downstream capital expenditure...|$|E

40|$|In the {{chemical}} and petrochemical industry, it is quite common that the manufacturing of a final product {{is the result of}} several consecutive steps which can be owned and operated by one or many participants. Although not always practical, equal ownership among all partners along the value chain is often recommended as a way to simplify business structure, ensuring all partners share equally in {{the ups and downs of}} an uncertain market. In contrast to this approach, there are instances where more benefit can be derived from having different owners and operators along the value chain. Examples which are common practice in the industry are the supply of utilities (e. g., electricity), feedstock, and services. In these cases, the nonintegrated approach offers value as: It provides the operator of the upstream or utility plants the opportunity to specialize, for example, by operating very similar plants around the world. Such specialization enables the use of regional operating centers, minimum onsite cash costs, optimized operating conditions, minimized energy consumption, and the optimal use of other variable cost parameters. This article shows that if outsourcing results in a cash cost saving by an upstream operator, the benefit to the downstream owner will (in financial reward) be proportional to the cash cost saving achieved. In absolute terms, the magnitude of the benefit is moderated by the size of the downstream capital investment (The bigger the <b>downstream</b> <b>investment</b> relative to the upstream investment, the smaller the impact of the saving on the economics of the downstream company). As a “utility provider” an upstream operator benefits from lower risk in terms of offtake and market price uncertainties. Such owners benefit from a lower cost of capital, and as such also have lower return expectations than players further along in the value chain (who are exposed to all the uncertainties in volatile markets). This article shows that the positive impact of such benefits to the return of the downstream partner is directly proportional the difference in return expectations between the upstream and downstream company. Once again, the absolute magnitude of the saving becomes more substantial as the ratio of upstream capital investment increases relative to the downstream capital investment. Economy of learning may also enable a specialized upstream company to obtain an asset at a lower capital than a less specialized downstream operator. This article shows that the positive impact of such a benefit is very similar to that of a lower return expectation by the upstream company. [URL] Engineerin...|$|E

Nine study sites (four in Upper Turasha Kinja: Mutamaiyu, Kianguyo, Mutarakwa, and Tulaga and five in Wanjohi WRUA: Geta, Gitei-Gatondo, Kiamboga, Mikeu, and Rayeta) were purposively selected. A total of 200 households were randomly sampled from the initial 476 farmers in two WRUAs who started PES implementation in 2008. Primary data was collected using pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire through face-to-face interview. The questionnaire written in English was administered by local trained enumerators who translated in either Swahili or local dialect for easier response. We targeted the PES-implementing farmers, members of two WRUAs to assess change in their WTA from the current flat rate payment of annual Kshs. 1700 (USD 17) per farmer. Nevertheless, flat rate payment has been observed to encourage administrative ease and perceived as equitable in PES schemes (Sanchez et al. 2015).|$|R

The central issue remains how best to enable technological change, and accelerate innovation and widespread adoption of new energy technologies and move towards a more sustainable energy system. The first essay presents a stochastic dynamic real options model of the adoption of solar PV in the residential and commercial sector, evaluating the threshold and timing of the consumer's optimal investment decision given two sources of uncertainty. Analytic results regarding the threshold of adoption under alternative regimes of R&D funding and technological change, electricity prices, subsidies and carbon taxes are derived. And we simulate the model to obtain a cumulative likelihood and timing of substitution amongst energy resources and towards solar PV under plausible rates of technological change, electricity prices, subsidies and carbon taxes. The results indicate {{that there will be}} a displacement of incumbent technologies and a widespread shift towards solar PV in the residential and commercial sector in under 30 years, under plausible parameter assumptions - and that crucially, this can occur independent of consumer subsidies and carbon pricing policies (at $ 21 /ton CO 2, $ 65 /ton CO 2 and $ 150 /ton CO 2). In general, results across all scenarios consistently indicate that average historic consumer subsidies and carbon pricing policies up to $ 150 /ton CO 2 have a modest effect in accelerating adoption, and may not be an effective part of climate policy in this regard. Instead, we find that R&D support and further technological change is the crucial determinant and main driver of widespread adoption of solar PV - suggesting that subsidies and taxes don't make a substantial difference in a technology that's not viable, while research does. This further suggests that optimal policies may change over time, however current continued R&D support and technological advancement is the crucial determinant of widespread transition to solar and plausibly other backstop technologies - and that it should play a key role in policy measures intended to combat climate change. The results do not imply that carbon pricing shouldn't play a role in climate policy in general. Carbon pricing may be effective in reducing emissions and encouraging the transition towards other clean technologies - however it has a decidedly modest impact in accelerating adoption of solar PV at levels up to $ 150 /ton CO 2. The second essay examines the role of technology features in policy design, and provides a broader discussion and context to the results from the first essay. It examines the key role of the technology innovation cycle and changing optimal policies at every stage of the technology in the transition towards renewable energy technologies. And it examines the stages of the technology innovation process and the role of policy incentives at every stage - including the timing, sequencing, and role of investments in public R&D, in deployment polices, and in CO 2 taxes. We examine the notion that that optimal policies will change over time, driven primarily by the characteristics of the technology, and its stage in the innovation cycle - and that this will crucially determine the impact, gains and tradeoffs between alternate policy measures such as R&D policies, deployment policies, and carbon pricing policies. We find that technology and policies must be deployed in a coordinated manner such that emission reduction benefits are achieved at an acceptable cost. And we find that targeted policy should consider every stage of the technology innovation cycle - from R&D to commercialization in overcoming barriers to the development and widespread adoption of nascent technologies. Based on our analysis and results we find that there is a pressing need for the reallocation of public resources from consumer subsidies towards public R&D budgets in emerging energy technologies such as solar PV, and plausibly other backstop technologies. We argue for an expanded role of aggressive R&D policies and increased public R&D funding - and contend that there is an imbalance in resources allocated towards adoption and commercialization subsidies relative to R&D investments for a technology such as solar PV. We contend that increased and aggressive R&D investments will be the key policy initiative in enabling the transition towards clean energy technologies such as solar PV in a sustainable manner. When deployment policies are justified, the appropriate timing and sequencing in the technology development stage is crucial. Investments in commercialization and deployment subsidies before sufficient R&D investments and breakthroughs have occurred will be ineffective and unsustainable, or alternatively will need to be very high to have any significant impact (Torani, Rausser, and Zilberman, 2014). Widespread adoption and commercialization of emerging and unproven technologies and systems will be unlikely to occur unless sufficient major technological discoveries and improvements have taken place - which will need to be driven by appropriate and sufficient R&D investments. The logical sequence of policies necessitates first making sufficient investments and allocating resources towards R&D and the necessary technological discoveries, which can then be followed by <b>downstream</b> <b>investments</b> to enhance adoption, experience and LBD. In general, we find that the appropriate emphasis and sequencing of R&D and learning investments is a pertinent issue, and optimal timing and allocation between the two depends in part on the characteristics of the technology itself. In addition, while almost all economic studies find a case for imposing immediate restraints on GHG emissions, e. g. with initially low carbon taxes, we find that reasonable and plausible levels of CO 2 taxes may not be effective in encouraging technology adoption and reducing emissions while clean technologies are not commercially viable as yet. To be effective in encouraging technology adoption at an early stage of technological innovation, we contend that a large CO 2 tax may be needed, far larger than suggested at reasonable levels - with significant implications on distributional effects and political feasibility. We emphasize that technology and policies must be deployed in a coordinated manner such that the emission reduction benefits are achieved at an acceptable cost (Williams et al., 2012). Our results suggest that the first and most important stage does not lie in imposing CO 2 taxes, but rather in investing in R&D and technological advancements. Once clean technologies are sufficiently ready, reasonably priced carbon taxes will bite to a larger extent and be more effective at plausible levels. We find that one plausible strategy would be either to introduce high CO 2 taxes or to subsidize R&D first, followed by deployment and LBD policies, and then to impose reasonable carbon taxes - in which case scientific advances and technological changes would make CO 2 emissions abatement less costly, and CO 2 pricing would be effective at reasonable levels. The third essay provides a precursor and basis for the other two chapters. The paper outlines an analytical framework to determine the optimal combination of renewable energy public R&D investment in combination with downstream policy instruments across the emerging technologies as an ex-ante portfolio analysis of public and private R&D under risk and uncertainty. Our framework is based on the estimation of probability distributions for potential future cost reductions resulting from R&D investments from the public and private sectors. To date, the government lacks coordinated support of renewable energy technologies across upstream R&D <b>investments</b> and <b>downstream</b> policy instruments. Without an objective, ex-ante guide for renewable energy investment, governments are likely to promote technologies based on the effectiveness of political economic efforts. The government's policies should however depend on the technology's probability distribution of cost breakthroughs for each technology and on the environmental impact. In this paper we outline an analytical framework to develop a portfolio analysis of R&D investments in renewable energy technologies, with the subsequent analysis designed to allocate R&D investments across renewable energy technologies in a manner that minimizes the risk for a specified level of expected returns, taking into account both the expected reductions in cost and the variance of the expectations of cost reductions, and thus providing an objective benchmark for efficient allocation of resources across renewable energy technologies. Special emphasis is placed on the estimation of probability distributions based on elicitation from experts in each field of technology in terms of the mean and standard deviation - on which we base the characterization of the underlying probability distributions on cost and productivity measures, and which forms the basis for executing a portfolio analysis of renewable energy technologies...|$|R
