40|$|Glass panes {{structurally}} {{bonded to}} a steel framework {{can be used}} as a stability system for buildings. A system built up of a single glass pane, a steel frame and a <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry of the glass pane. The applied criteria are the strength of glass for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength of glass is the criterion and is located on the glass pane's surface in the vicinity of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> which anchors the tensile diagonal of the glass pane. These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame. However, the stress distribution in the glass pane as well as in the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is unfavourable for systems with one-sided rigid joint.

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board laminations, bond line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green glued bond lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of glued bonds it was concluded that green glued bonds with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry glued bonds. For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry glued bonds, whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry <b>glued</b> finger <b>joints</b> demonstrated that <b>joints</b> <b>glued</b> from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green <b>glued</b> <b>joints</b> and <b>joints</b> <b>glued</b> after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the glue penetration into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> than in a <b>joint</b> that is <b>glued</b> in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed commercial grading systems...|$|R

Results have shown that member of joint, number of connector, size of biscuit and type of adhesive had significant effect on the bending moment resistance. Bending moment resistance of joints made of Beech wood were stronger than joints made of Fir ones. Bending moment resistance has increased, with the increase of size and number of biscuit.

30|$|Glued {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{are often}} used in joints for {{furniture}} such as chairs. However, such joints are not sufficiently resistant to withdrawal forces {{because of the difficulty}} of applying a clamping pressure to the surfaces being glued. Therefore, some reinforcement, {{such as the use of}} dowel-type fasteners, is necessary. In this study, we discussed the applicability of the shrink-fit method used in green woodworking to strengthen glued round mortise and tenon joints. The test specimens were assembled using wet mortise members and air-dried tenon members with polyvinyl acetate resin emulsion adhesive. Withdrawal tests on joint specimens of four hardwood species were conducted to study the reinforcing effects of the shrink fit on the withdrawal performance of the mortise and tenon joints. The proposed shrink-fitted glued round mortise and tenon joint exhibited sufficient withdrawal strength equivalent to that of the <b>joint</b> <b>glued</b> with epoxy resin adhesive. After applying four humidity cycles to simulate seasonal variations in moisture content, withdrawal strength did not decrease significantly. The proposed joint could withstand the withdrawal force to some extent after adhesion was fractured by shear force.|$|R
50|$|Hide glue {{creates a}} {{somewhat}} brittle joint, so a strong shock will often cause a very clean break along the joint. In contrast, cleaving a <b>joint</b> <b>glued</b> with PVA will usually damage the surrounding material, creating an irregular break {{that is more}} difficult to repair. This brittleness is taken advantage of by instrument makers. For example, instruments in the violin family require periodic disassembly for repairs and maintenance. The top of a violin is easily removed by prying a palette knife between the top and ribs, and running it all around the joint. The brittleness allows the top to be removed, often without significant damage to the wood. Regluing the top only requires applying new hot hide <b>glue</b> to the <b>joint.</b> If the violin top were glued on with PVA glue, removing the top would require heat and steam to disassemble the joint (causing damage to the varnish), then wood would have to be removed from the joint to ensure no cured PVA glue was remaining before regluing the top.|$|R
