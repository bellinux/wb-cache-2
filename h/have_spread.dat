This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
25|$|Testicular {{cancer has}} one of the highest cure rates of all cancers with an average five-year {{survival}} rate of 95%. If the cancer <b>has</b> not <b>spread</b> outside the testicle, the 5-year survival is 99% while if it has grown into nearby structures or <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> to nearby lymph nodes, the rate is 96% and if it <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> to organs or lymph nodes away from the testicles, the 5-year survival is around 74%. Even for the relatively few cases in which cancer <b>has</b> <b>spread</b> widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 80%.|$|R

5|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} {{was first introduced}} into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America. The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships. They <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the South and Southwest.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige died on 22 December 1060 and {{was buried}} at Peterborough, {{in what is}} now Peterborough Cathedral. After his death, he was honoured as a saint by the monks at Peterborough, {{although}} the cult does not seem to <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> far. His bones, along with those of his predecessor Ælfric Puttoc, were found in 1643. His reputation for sanctity and poverty was based on his actions, as he often traveled on foot, and spent much time preaching and giving alms. The Northumbrian Priests' Law which is usually attributed to Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, might have been authored instead by Cynesige, or possibly Cynesige's predecessor Ælfric Puttoc. He gave gifts to Peterborough in his will, but the gifts were taken by Queen Edith instead.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks are thought to <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} have {{established}} breeding populations in areas {{to which they}} have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E
5|$|News of Breyer's ride to Roubaix may <b>have</b> <b>spread.</b> Half {{those who}} entered {{did not turn}} up at the Brassérie de l'Espérance, the race {{headquarters}} at the start. Those who dropped out before the race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider {{who went on to}} organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange's first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix because he and two brothers had opened a cycle shop in the boulevard de Paris the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Nose {{piercing}} {{also has}} a long history. c. 1500 BCE, the Vedas refer to Lakshmi's nose piercings, but modern practice in India is believed to <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> from the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes by route of the Mughal emperors in the 16th century. It remains customary for Indian Hindu {{women of childbearing age}} to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of an activity into a sport {{and then an}} entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of surfing is associated with Hawaii and that of snow skiing probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport {{such as in the}} case of ice hockey—an important entertainment in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus, which {{includes}} all extant equines, {{is believed to}} have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged E. livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern equines (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> rapidly once they evolved.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E

The Rangers, a neutral peacekeeping force that operates throughout the system, have since occupied the D6 military facility Artyom visited during the first game. This is a huge, and not fully explored pre-war bunker, and Artyom, now a Ranger himself, remains unsure whether killing the Dark Ones was the correct decision. Rumors of D6's discovery, and its great riches, <b>have</b> <b>spread</b> around the Metro; rival factions, such as the Communist Red Line and Nazi Fourth Reich, hope to seize the bunker and its contents.|$|E
