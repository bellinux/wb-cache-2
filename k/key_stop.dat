5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their <b>key,</b> <b>stop,</b> and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this {{also makes it}} possible to record and play back an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra prospered {{as part of}} the Umayyad Caliphate, and its {{population}} grew. It was a <b>key</b> <b>stop</b> on the East-West trade route, with a large souq (market), built by the Umayyads, who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a mosque. During this period, Palmyra was a stronghold of the Banu Kalb tribe. After being defeated by Marwan II during a civil war in the caliphate, Umayyad contender Sulayman ibn Hisham fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra, but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb leader al-Abrash al-Kalbi in 745. That year, Marwan ordered the city's walls demolished.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the American Civil War, the city's {{access to}} the Canada–US border made it a <b>key</b> <b>stop</b> for runaway slaves along the {{underground}} railroad. The Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Detroit's Campus Martius Park commemorates the state's role in the American Civil War. Thousands of Detroiters formed volunteer regiments, including the 24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary Iron Brigade) which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at Gettysburg in 1863. Abraham Lincoln {{is quoted as saying}} Thank God for Michigan! Following Lincoln's assassination, General George Armstrong Custer delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near Campus Martius Park. Custer led the Michigan Brigade during the American Civil War and called them the Wolverines.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the first}} 24 {{seconds of the}} second half, Griese and Streets {{connected}} on back-to-back passes of 15 and 41 yards {{to tie the game}} at 14. Michigan scored again just over five minutes later on a 14-yard run by Floyd. Michigan's defense overcame three fourth-quarter turnovers and held Notre Dame scoreless in the second half to preserve the 21–14 lead. [...] After Aaron Shea lost a fumble at the Michigan 47-yard line, cornerback Tommy Hendricks made a diving interception in the end zone with 10:34 remaining in the game. When Notre Dame recovered a loose ball two minutes later at the Wolverines 42-yard line, Michigan's defense forced a punt after a three-and-out. The Wolverines suffered a third turnover late in the fourth quarter when Griese and Chris Howard botched a handoff that Notre Dame recovered at the Michigan 28-yard line. Notre Dame drove to the 20-yard line, but Glen Steele and James Hall made a <b>key</b> <b>stop</b> on fourth down. Howard helped Michigan run out the final 3:26 with runs of 27, seven, nine and eight yards.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the American Civil War, the city's {{access to}} the Canada–US border made it a <b>key</b> <b>stop</b> for refugee slaves gaining freedom in the North along the Underground Railroad.

2500|$|The African Americans of Oberlin {{and those}} {{attending}} Oberlin College [...] "have experienced intense challenges and immense accomplishments since their joint founding in 1833. Its African American {{and other students}} of color have used education and activism to influence the college, the town, and beyond. Their efforts have helped Oberlin remain committed to its values of freedom, social justice, and service." [...] The College's approach to African Americans {{was by no means}} perfect. Although intensely anti-slavery, including admitting black students immediately from its founding, the school began segregating its black students by the 1880s with the fading of evangelical idealism. Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African-American college graduates {{by the end of the}} 19th century. The college was listed as a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, for its significance in admitting African Americans and women. Oberlin is also the oldest coeducational institution in the United States, having admitted four women in 1837. These four women, who were the first to enter as full students, were Mary Kellogg (Fairchild), Mary Caroline Rudd, Mary Hosford, and Elizabeth Prall. All but Kellogg graduated. Mary Jane Patterson graduated in 1862 as the first black woman to earn a B.A. degree. Soon women were fully integrated into the college, and comprised from a third to half of the student body. The religious founders, especially evangelical theologian Charles Grandison Finney, saw women as inherently morally superior to men. Oberlin briefly stopped operating for seven months 1839 and 1840 due to lack of funds, making it the second oldest continuously operating coeducational liberal arts. The faculty of Oberlin quarreled frequently with the highly religious president Mahan, and in 1850 voted unanimously to relieve him of his position as president. In his place, famed abolitionist and preacher Charles Grandison Finney (already a professor at the college since its founding) was made president, serving until 1866. Under Finney's leadership, Oberlin's faculty and students increased their activity in the abolitionist movement. They participated together with people of the town in biracial efforts to help fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad (where Oberlin was a <b>key</b> <b>stop),</b> as well as to resist the Fugitive Slave Act. One historian called Oberlin [...] "the town that started the Civil War" [...] due to its reputation as a hotbed of abolitionism. In 1858, both students and faculty were involved in the controversial Oberlin-Wellington Rescue of a fugitive slave, which received national press coverage. Two participants in this raid, Lewis Sheridan Leary and John Anthony Copeland, along with another Oberlin resident, Shields Green, also participated in John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry. [...] This heritage was commemorated on campus by the 1977 installation of sculptor Cameron Armstrong's [...] "Underground Railroad Monument" [...] (a railroad track rising from the ground toward the sky) and monuments to the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue and the Harper's Ferry Raid.|$|E

40|$|Public transit plays a {{key role}} in shaping the {{transportation}} structure of large and fast growing cities. To cope with high population and employment density, such cities usually resort to multi-modal transit services, such as rail, BRT and bus. These modes are strategically connected to form an effective transit network. Among the transit modes, bus stops need to be properly deployed to maintain an acceptable walking accessibility. This paper presents a hierarchical process for optimizing bus stop locations in the context of fast growing multi-modal transit services. Three types of bus stops are identified hierarchically, which includes connection <b>stops,</b> <b>key</b> <b>stops</b> and ordinary stops. Connection stops are generated manually to connect with other transit facilities. <b>Key</b> <b>stops</b> and ordinary stops are optimized with coverage models that are respectively weighted by network centrality measure and potential demand. A case study in a Chinese city suggests the hierarchical approach may generate more effective stop distribution...|$|R
