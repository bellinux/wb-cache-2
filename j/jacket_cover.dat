500|$|Kenyatta {{assembled}} the seminar papers on Kikuyu society {{that he had}} written for Malinowski's class, publishing these as Facing Mount Kenya in 1938. Malinowski wrote an introduction for the book, while the <b>jacket</b> <b>cover</b> featured an image of Kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear. The book was published under the name [...] "Jomo Kenyatta", {{the first time that}} he had done so; the term Jomo was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. Facing Mount Kenya was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu it challenged.|$|E
2500|$|In its October 18, 1969 issue, Rolling Stone ran a tongue-in-cheek {{review of}} a {{non-existent}} album that purportedly captured a [...] "super session" [...] of the era's leading rock and roll musicians, including Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney. The review claimed {{that none of the}} artists could be listed on the <b>jacket</b> <b>cover</b> because of contractual agreements with their recording companies. The editors involved decided to extend the joke by hiring a relatively obscure band to record an actual album and then secured a deal with Warner Bros. As an indication of how many people were taken in by the joke, The Masked Marauders reached No. 114 on the Billboard's album chart.|$|E
