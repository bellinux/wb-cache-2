5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 {{on the site of}} an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills <b>for</b> <b>corn</b> and fulling, lime kilns and coal mines.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. The climate was more favourable for oats and barley than <b>for</b> <b>corn.</b> The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare.|$|E

Parametric survival analysis modeling of interval-censored data and incorporating patient-specific frailty terms was utilized, to model correlation of corns within patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 189; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 780 – 1. 813; P = 0. 422). Median resolution times were 10. 0 months <b>for</b> <b>corns</b> in the treatment group and 13. 4 months <b>for</b> <b>corns</b> in the control group.
