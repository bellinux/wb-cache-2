40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The {{objective}} of the report is to analyse simulation results coming {{from the use of}} a policy evaluation method that encompasses a wider set of determinants for technology choice. To that end, we use the EEB_Sweden model v 1. 0. Still in an early stage of development, the model offers an opportunity to capture or integrate critical modelling aspects that justify our research project. In particular, we address several aspects to capture a more decentralised micro-economic decision framework for efficient technologies, including: (i) equal level of importance between financial/technology choice decision criteria and non-financial aspects, (ii) use and inclusion of non-financial criteria (e. g. reliability, predictability and appearance); and (iii) development and introduction of owner-tenant relationship in order to capture the ‘principal-agent’ problem. We scrutinise the method by evaluating different policy instruments: (i) zero-net energy buildings combined with existing policy instruments (e. g. grants), (ii) increased in energy price combined with existing policy instruments, (iii) an integrated policy mix encompassing several policy instruments; including existing ones. Two alternative baselines for comparative analysis are developed. One baseline depicts business-as-usual scenario in which market-driven or autonomous energy efficiency improvements take place. The second baseline attempts to capture the long term implication of existing policy instruments targeting the Swedish residential sector. Simulation results suggest that: • The single- and two-dwelling building stock uses energy less intensively compared to baselines. The order of magnitude of efficiency improvements is related to the applied policy instruments. For instance, in the presence of financial and non-financial decision criteria, current policies combined with a zero-net energy building regulation drive a much less energy intensity pattern after 2020 compared to the baselines. Due to the enlargement of the building stock as such, primary energy consumption as a whole increases. In all scenarios, efficiency improvements reduce the growth rate of primary energy consumption. • The impacts of current policies, even if energy prices grow dramatically, are modest. When energy prices increase (by a factor of 10), our results are more modest than estimated by other modelling groups. In turn, this suggests that the impacts of current policies are likely to be overestimated. Our results seem to be consistent with ex-post assessments. The main reason for this {{is likely to be the}} behavioural components included in the technology choice decision framework we use for the policy assessment. • Small plugs (e. g. appliances) and large plugs (e. g. <b>dish</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines)</b> deliver marginal improvements. This may suggest that even if efficient technologies in these segments are attractive from the financial point of view in the long-run (e. g. A+ refrigerator), non-financial aspects drive decision makers to adopt technologies that are more attractive in other criteria (e. g. appearance, reliability) which are not necessarily energy efficient. This pattern is consistent with empirical behavioural studies. • Space-heating represents the major supply of efficiency improvements on a per building basis under analysed scenarios. This result is also consistent with several studies addressing the Swedish residential sector. • Consistent with empirical (and not modelling) studies, our results show that decision-makers are less motivated to adopt efficient technologies based solely on (high) energy costs. • Results suggest that when non-financial aspects of technology choice are included, decision makers tend to adopt technologies more “rationally” when confronted with a more integrated policy scenario, one that does not focus on a single-technology but on buildings as a system. In our case, we simulated a first-cost subsidy which is given once the energy intensity of the building is reduced below a certain threshold (e. g. 50 ~ 75 kWh/m 2 /yr). This policy scenario triggers a radical transformation of the building stock. We conclude and stress that the entire modelling exercise must be taken as a departure point to further develop a more comprehensive and realistic micro-economic decision framework. Within this learning and experimental research context, modelling results were used for policy insights rather than the forecasting of specific of numbers – like most modelling studies. With due limitations, our modelling results show that that a larger representation of determinants in energy modelling tools is necessary to better evaluate and enhance our understanding of policy choices and their impacts. Whereas many aspects deserve much more analysis, results suggest that the modelling approach included in the EEB_Sweden model should be further developed and used for policy assessment. A critical first research step involves the development of a database that represents the current technology configurations and corresponding energy and carbon values of the Swedish residential sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{revisions}} of the lifting equation used by NIOSH {{in an effort to}} assist in the analysis and prevention of back injuries caused by manual lifting reflected new findings and provided methods for evaluating asymmetrical lifting tasks and lifts of objects with less than optimal couplings between the object and the hands of the person doing the lifting. The revised equation also provided guidelines for a more diverse range of lifting tasks than did the earlier equation. The equation was only one tool of several to be used in a comprehensive effort to prevent work related low back pain and disability. The equation was discussed through a definition of the terms used, the limitations of the lifting task, the various components of the equation (horizontal, vertical, distance, asymmetry, frequency, and coupling), and the lifting index. Procedures were described for analyzing lifting jobs. Several example problems were considered, including jobs performed a few times per shift such as loading punch press stock, loading supply rolls, and loading bags into a hopper; single tasks performed repetitively such as package inspection and <b>dish</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> unloading; repetitive multitasks of short duration including a depalletizing operation and handling cans of liquid; and repetitive multitasks of long duration such as product packaging and warehouse order filling.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} possibilities and limitations of the hot-fill principle applied in <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and <b>dish</b> <b>washing</b> equipment. The study started with literature research, showing the washing performance of hot-fill <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> to be generally poorer than the performance of cold-fill equipment. Moreover, <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> specifically adapted to hot-fill have longer pay-back periods. For hot-fill dish washers no unequivocal measuring results relating to energy consumption and <b>dish</b> <b>washing</b> performance were available. That's why the study further focused on dish washers. A number of energy consumption measurements and washing performance tests at various operating modes have shown the greatest energy cost cuts to be attained in filling a standard dish washer with hot water. The washing and drying performance is not affected by hot-fill. From supplementary measurements it appeared that storage-type water heaters are most suitable for this application. With this type of appliance energy consumption is lowest. Dimensioning of the hot water piping is important. Only if the sizing is kept to a minimum, will there be any saving of primary energy, when running the 65 degrees C standard program. Application of hot-fill dish washers will contribute to a reduction of environmental acidification. Given the current use of the various washing programs in the Netherlands hot-fill will also help reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|Grid-connected {{photovoltaic}} (PV) based {{power generation}} technology is being {{pushed to the}} forefront as a viable alternative source of renewable energy, particularly in small-scale domestic applications. Due to the variable nature of solar energy, PV usually works well with battery storage to provide continuous and stable energy. However, by incorporating storage with such systems {{there is a need}} to develop controllers that allow the owners to maximize the benefit of such systems and so require sophisticated control strategies. In this work a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) state space model of a PV array, load energy demand, battery bank and utility grid was used to develop a model predictive control setup for a grid connected photovoltaic-battery power generation system. Artificial neural network (ANN) based energy demand prediction was used as the output measured disturbance for the MPC. Switched constraints were used for the MIMO state space model to mimic the dynamic behavior of the storage system. Simulation results show that the proposed MPC would activate non-critical electrical appliances usage at periods when excess PV energy was available from the PV array. Further, it would also allocate energy to the battery storage when this was available, and, when load energy demand was more than the PV array produced would deactivate non-critical appliances (<b>dish</b> washer, <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and dryer) and use battery energy if necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> {{has lately}} {{been an important}} issue for the appliance industry. Current environmental awareness demands the improvement of machine efficiency and increasing of quality of washing processes. Developing of high efficient and high speed spinning <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> raises the problem of designing smart suspension systems to control vibration and noise in real time. In the paper a horizontal-axis <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> is under the study. The machine has a drum with perforated walls. In the water extraction process, the drum starts rotation and this gives rise to significant centrifugal imbalance forces and imbalanced rotation of the laundry mass. This results in vibration and shaking. By elimination of such vibrations {{it will be possible}} to design more silent <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> for higher <b>wash</b> loads within the same outside dimensions. In the paper the results of modelling of dynamics of <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and designing of smart suspension system comprising magnetoreological dampers for semi-active vibration control are presented. The commercial software MSC.
