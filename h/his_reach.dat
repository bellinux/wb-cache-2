5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres in gold and a position within the Royal Household. Such rewards enabled Carrouge to begin further legal action, attempting to exert his earlier claim to Arnou-le-Faucon. However, this land which Carrouges so coveted remained beyond <b>his</b> <b>reach.</b> Count Pierre, who held the land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is about a}} {{relationship}} just out of <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{staged a}} {{comeback}} {{in the late}} 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> to the MTV Generation while keeping his musical style intact. He remains a popular and critically praised recording artist and concert performer in the 2010s. He has won 19 Grammy Awards (including a Lifetime Achievement Award, presented in 2001) and two Emmy Awards, and was named an NEA Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree. Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within <b>his</b> <b>reach,</b> does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
5|$|Van Nistelrooy {{took the}} first penalty for Manchester United, {{in front of the}} United fans, and sent Lehmann the wrong way to give United the early advantage. Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes stepped up to take United's second, only to see it saved by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive, Vieira's kick was just out of <b>his</b> <b>reach,</b> giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within <b>his</b> <b>reach,</b> and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

Heavy rain prevented <b>his</b> <b>reaching</b> them, so he turned to attack Peronne station, descending to 500 feet and coming under heavy anti-aircraft gun fire. This fire prevented <b>his</b> <b>reaching</b> the station, but he climbed to 1,500 feet and attacked a [...] "Rocket" [...] battery, silencing one of its guns." ...|$|R

25|$|Coffin {{started a}} strong nuclear {{disarmament}} program at Riverside, and hired Cora Weiss (a secular Jew {{he had worked}} with during the Vietnam War and had traveled with to North Vietnam in 1972 to accompany three released U.S. prisoners of war), an action which was uncomfortable for some parishioners. Broadening <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> to an international audience, he met with numerous world leaders and traveled abroad. His visits included going to Iran to perform Christmas services for hostages being held in the U.S. embassy during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 and to Nicaragua to protest U.S. military intervention there.|$|E

25|$|After his five-year {{winning streak}} {{was brought to}} an end with a {{majority}} decision defeat by nondescript heavyweight Billy Zumbrun in August 2001, he fought his first ten rounder against fifty-two-year-old former world heavyweight champion Larry Holmes at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia on July 27, 2002. While Holmes won a unanimous decision, Esch was credited with a controversial knockdown in the final round. Holmes fought a fight on points, playing on <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> advantage, wary of Butterbean's knockout punch. This {{was one of only}} three fights in a 109 fight career that was scheduled for more than four rounds.|$|E
25|$|He {{was known}} for his {{determination}} to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond <b>his</b> <b>reach.</b> As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically awkward to be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship. In similar fashion, Grant expressed a desire to be a successful bookkeeper although many of his associates criticized his penmanship. He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach penmanship at one of the local academies.|$|E

25|$|Simeon {{was aware}} that he needed naval support to conquer Constantinople and in 922 sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to {{negotiate}} {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. The caliph agreed to send his own representatives to Bulgaria to arrange an alliance but his envoys were captured en route by the Byzantines near the Calabrian coast. Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos managed to avert a Bulgarian–Arab alliance by showering the Arabs with generous gifts. By {{the time of his death}} in May 927, Simeon controlled almost all Byzantine possessions in the Balkans, but Constantinople remained out of <b>his</b> <b>reach.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E
25|$|After Timur left, {{different}} Muslim Sultans enforced {{their power}} {{in what used}} to be Delhi Sultanate. In Kashmir, Sultan Sikandar began expanding, and unleashed religious violence that earned him the name but-shikan or idol-breaker. He earned this sobriquet because of the sheer scale of desecration and destruction of Hindu and Buddhist temples, shrines, ashrams, hermitages and other holy places in what is now known as Kashmir and its neighboring territories. He destroyed the vast majority of Hindu and Buddhist temples within <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> in the Kashmir region (north and northwest India). Encouraged by Islamic theologian, Muhammad Hamadani, Sikandar Butshikan also destroyed ancient Hindu and Buddhist books and banned followers of dharmic religions from prayers, dance, music, consumption of wine and observation of their religious festivals. To escape the religious violence during his reign, many Hindus converted to Islam and many left Kashmir. Many were also killed.|$|E

25|$|At {{midnight on}} 9 July 1897, Mat Salleh {{successfully}} led {{his followers to}} attack the Company’s settlement on Gaya Island. They raided and torched the Gaya compound before escaping with loot estimated to be worth Straits $100,000. They also took hostage F. S. Neubronner, the treasury clerk. The success of this attack increased {{his reputation as a}} local hero. This helped to further widen <b>his</b> <b>reach,</b> influence and support. After this attack, the Company proceeded to seek compensation from the Brunei Sultanate. The Managing Director, Cowie and the Governor, L. P. Beaufort, visited the Sultan of Brunei seeking compensation, claiming that some of the attackers were from regions under his jurisdiction. These areas were also claimed to have had been used as bases by Mat Salleh. The negotiations brought the Mengkabong, Manggatal and Api-Api districts (opposite of Gaya Island) under the Company's administration.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of his career in 1932 his play was {{observed}} by Great Britain's then active Davis Cup player Nigel Sharpe, who described Rogers as the tallest man on the field at the time who took advantage of his height. In baseline game <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> advantage came into picture and was very effective against passing shots. When it came to volleying he lacked the sufficient quickness to cover the net at its full length and moved uncomfortably in the forecourt. So {{he was one of the}} few baseliners of his time. His hit the ball flat and with a short swing. His first serve had great speed, while the second was rather a kick-serve, which showed to be his weakness. His forehand drive was strong and his overhead smashes were fine enough. In doubles he positioned himself between the T-line and the baseline, which was an unordinary gameplan.|$|E
25|$|Since Dyson {{was being}} tackled by the legs, {{there was still}} the {{possibility}} he could reach towards the end zone and get the ball across the goal line. Both players went into a rolling motion as Dyson outstretched his hand with the football towards the goal line {{in the hopes of}} scoring the touchdown. Though <b>his</b> <b>reach</b> was close, and the ball mere inches away from the end zone, it was still not enough to score. As the rolling motion came to an end, with Jones now on top of Dyson's legs, his shoulder had touched the ground and, therefore, the game was over. Had Dyson scored and the extra point been converted, {{it would have been the}} first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime. Alternatively, had Dyson scored, the Titans could have attempted a 2-point conversion for the outright win.|$|E
