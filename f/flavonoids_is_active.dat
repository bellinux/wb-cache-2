40|$|Cut-shoot {{bioassay}} {{test was used}} to study the significance of three flavonoids as aphicides against the woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann). The used <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> two flavanols that are quercetin dehydrate and rutin hydrate, but rutin hydrate is a glycoside of quercetin dehydrate. In addition to one flavanone that <b>was</b> naringine. These <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> used at three concentrations; 100 ppm, 1000 ppm and 10, 000 ppm. Results showed that the three tested <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> <b>active</b> as aphicides against the target species and that mortality to nymphs was higher than that obtained against apterous adults. Increasing the concentration of the flavonoids resulted in a remarkable increase in nymphs mortality. However, rutin hydrate is more toxic to WAA than quercetin dehydrate and naringin. The three flavonoids had slight effect on the sole parasitoid of WAA, Aphelinus mali compared with effect caused by imodacloprid insecticide. Quercetin dehydrate, rutin hydrate and naringine can be used as botanical insecticides and incorporated into integrated management programs of the aphid. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous {{studies have}} pointed to the plant {{flavonoids}} myricetin and quercetin as two structurally related stimulators of vascular Ca(v) 1. 2 channel current (I(Ca 1. 2)). Here we have tested {{the proposition that the}} flavonoid structure confers the ability to modulate Ca(v) 1. 2 channels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Twenty-four <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> analysed for their effects on I(Ca 1. 2) in rat tail artery myocytes, using the whole-cell patch-clamp method. KEY RESULTS: Most of the flavonoids stimulated or inhibited I(Ca 1. 2) in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner with EC(50) values ranging between 4. 4 µM (kaempferol) and 16. 0 µM (myricetin) for the stimulators and IC(50) values between 13. 4 µM (galangin) and 100 µM [(±) -naringenin] for the inhibitors. Key structural requirements for I(Ca 1. 2) stimulatory activity were the double bond between C 2 and C 3 and the hydroxylation pattern on the flavonoid scaffold, the latter also determining the molecular charge, as shown by molecular modelling techniques. Absence of OH groups in the B ring was key in I(Ca 1. 2) inhibition. The functional interaction between quercetin and either the stimulator myricetin or the antagonists resokaempferol, crysin, genistein, and 5, 7, 2 '-trihydroxyflavone revealed that quercetin expressed the highest apparent affinity, in the low µM range, for Ca(v) 1. 2 channels. Neither protein tyrosine kinase nor protein kinase Cα were involved in quercetin-induced stimulation of I(Ca 1. 2). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Quercetin-like plant <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> <b>active</b> on vascular Ca(v) 1. 2 channels. Thus, the <b>flavonoid</b> scaffold may <b>be</b> a template for the design of novel modulators of vascular smooth muscle Ca(v) 1. 2 channels, valuable for the treatment of hypertension and stroke...|$|R

Previous studies have proven that okra pods possess anti-fatigue activity, and {{the aim of}} this research is to clarify the anti-fatigue constituents. To achieve this, we divided okra pods (OPD) into seeds (OSD) and skins (OSK), and compared the contents of total polysaccharides, total polyphenols, total flavonoids, isoquercitrin, and quercetin- 3 -O-gentiobiose and the antioxidant activity in vitro and anti-fatigue activity in vivo between OSD and OSK. The contents of total polyphenols and total polysaccharides were 29. 5 % and 14. 8 % in OSD and 1. 25 % and 43. 1 % in OSK, respectively. Total flavonoids, isoquercitrin and quercetin- 3 -O-gentiobiose (5. 35 %, 2. 067 % and 2. 741 %, respectively) were only detected in OSD. Antioxidant assays, including 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and reducing power test, and weight-loaded swimming test showed OSD possessed significant antioxidant and anti-fatigue effects. Moreover, biochemical determination revealed that that anti-fatigue activity of OSD is caused by reducing the levels of blood lactic acid (BLA) and urea nitrogen (BUN), enhancing hepatic glycogen storage and promoting antioxidant ability by lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) level and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) levels.

40|$|Abstract: Fruits and {{vegetables}} <b>are</b> rich in <b>flavonoids,</b> and ample epidemiological {{data show that}} diets rich in fruits {{and vegetables}} confer protection against cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases, and cancer. However, <b>flavonoid</b> bioavailability <b>is</b> reportedly very low in mammals and the molecular mechanisms of their action are still poorly known. This review focuses on membrane transport of flavonoids, a critical determinant of their bioavailability. Cellular influx and efflux transporters are reviewed for their involvement in the absorption of flavonoids from the gastro-intestinal tract and their subsequent tissue distribution. A focus on the mammalian bilirubin transporter bilitranslocase (TCDB 2.

The result showed that X- 5 was the optimum macroporous resin to purify the total flavonoids of loquat leaf. After adsorbed by X- 5 macroporous resin, removing impurity with 15 % ethanol and desorbed with 65 % ethanol, the total flavonoids purity of the eluate was 82. 20 %, the purification factor was 2. 14 times and the recovery was 81. 08 %, and the macroporous resin should be regeneration after using 3 times.

The present study aims to characterise the in vivo effects of its total flavonoid (TF) fraction on bone properties and mineral metabolism as well as to study the mechanism involved in achieving its protective effects against ovariectomy (OVX) -induced bone loss. TF suppressed OVX-induced increase in urinary Ca excretion as well as loss of bone mass and strength at the distal femur in mice in a dosedependent manner. The changes in urinary Ca excretion were inversely correlated with the expressions of renal Ca transport protein (CaBP- 28 K) and vitamin D receptor mRNA in OVX mice. TF (100 mg/g) treatment prevented the deterioration of trabecular bone microarchitecture induced by OVX in mice. In addition, TF treatment increased the expression of type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA and the ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-kB ligand mRNA, and suppressed the increase in IL- 6 mRNA induced by OVX in the femur of mice. The present results indicate that the optimal dosage of the TF fraction of HEP for the improvement of bone properties and mineral metabolism in OVX mice was between 50 and 100 mg/g. Mechanistic studies indicated that TF might increase renal Ca reabsorption, stimulate the process of osteoblast formation as well as suppress the process of osteoclastogenesis in OVX mice.

Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of silibinin on adipogenic differentiation and thermogenic capacity of human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells. Silibinin (10 μM) treatment, either at the beginning or at the end of adipogenic differentiation, resulted in an increase of SIRT- 1, PPARα, Pgc- 1 α and UCPs gene expression. Moreover, silibinin administration resulted in a decrease of PPARγ, FABP 4, FAS and MEST/PEG 1 gene expression during the differentiation, confirming that this compound is able to reduce fatty acid accumulation and adipocyte size. Our data showed that silibinin regulated adipocyte lipid metabolism, inducing thermogenesis and promoting a brown remodelling in adipocyte.

There is still some uncertainty about the effective compounds, nevertheless, it is accepted that the <b>flavonoids</b> <b>are</b> important <b>active</b> constituents in skullcap. In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and neuroprotective potential of an ethanolic extract (SLE) prepared from leaves of S. lateriflora. The SLE main compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD. The flavones baicalein and baicalein- 7 -O-glucuronide were the major compounds found. The extract was very effective in scavenging the DPPH free radical (EC 50, 83 μg dwb/ml) and in reducing the lipid peroxidation of rabbit synaptossomes (EC 50, 10 μg dwb/ml), induced with ascorbate/Fe 2 +. We also assessed the potential antioxidant role of SLE in PC 12 cells submitted to lipid peroxidation with ascorbate/Fe 2 +, in conditions that cause a significant increase of TBARS products (5 x more). An SLE equivalent amount of 10 μg dwb/ml significantly reduced (10 %) the ascorbate/Fe 2 + induced lipidic peroxidation, namely when PC 12 cells were pre-incubated for 2 hours with the extract (35 % reduction). The SLE extract by itself, even in a non-diluted concentration (100 mg dwb/ml), did not affect cell viability of PC 12 cells under the experimental conditions used for lipid peroxidation. In a condition where ascorbate/Fe 2 + induced lipidic peroxidation cause a significant loss of PC 12 cell viability (up to 30 %), this effect was attenuated by the use of SLE (10 μg dwb/ml). When the PC 12 cells where pre-incubated for 2 hours with the same concentration of SLE, cell death was significantly reduced (only 10 % of the cells died). In conclusion, SLE could act as a strong antioxidant agent and have neuroprotective properties, which can account for the traditional use of this plant.

The closure of chalcones causes the formation of the <b>flavonoid</b> structure. <b>Flavonoids</b> <b>are</b> also closely related to flavones which are actually a sub class of <b>flavonoids,</b> and <b>are</b> the yellow pigments in plants. In addition to flavones, 11 other subclasses of Flavonoids including, isoflavones, flavans, flavanones, flavanols, flavanolols, anthocyanidins, catechins (including proanthocyanidins), leukoanthocyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and aurones.|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of two flavanoids, liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin, from Amboyna wood against the pathogenic fungi Corynespora cassiicola, Trichoderma harzianum, Fusarium oxysporum, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum were evaluated using the agar dilution and paper disk methods. Low concentrations of liquiritigenin (20 - 40 μM) and isoliquiritigenin (16 - 33 μM) satisfactorily inhibited {{the growth of}} all the test fungi. Antifungal {{activities of}} the two <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> found to be concentration-dependent. This is the first report that flavonoids from Amboyna wood <b>are</b> <b>active</b> against fungi pathogenic to the plants...|$|R

40|$|Seven pure <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> {{isolated}} and identified from five moss species. The <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> the flavones apigenin, apigenin- 7 -O- triglycoside, lucenin- 2, luteolin- 7 -O-neohesperidoside, saponarine and vitexin; and the biflavonoid bartramiaflavone. Some of these <b>flavonoids</b> <b>were</b> {{shown to have}} pronounced antibacterial effects against Enterobacter cloaceae, E. aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (minimal bacteriostatic concentration MIC {{in the range of}} 4 - 2048 μg/ml). Because of their antibacterial spectrum mainly active against Gram negative bacterial strains, responsible for severe opportunistic infections and resistant to common antibacterial therapy, these <b>flavonoids</b> may <b>be</b> important tools in antibacterial strategies.
