The June quake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9km (5.5mi).

5|$|The {{innermost}} ring of Neptune {{is called}} the Galle ring after Johann Gottfried Galle, {{the first person to}} see Neptune through a telescope (1846).

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded at a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
