5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the <b>feed</b> <b>rate.</b> It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Four {{experiments}} were carried out to evaluate the effect of <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> on growth performance of larger and juvenile tilapia by means of estimating growth rates, apparent nutrient digestibilities, feed utilization, body compositions, and nutrient and energy retentions. One nutritionally balanced diet (crude protein 342, crude fat 67, ash 47, starch 251 (all values in g (kg dry matter) - 1)) was prepared by extrusion and used in all experiments. The experiments were carried out in a freshwater recirculation system. The temperature was maintained at 25 to 26 oC, pH at 6. 8 and oxygen above 5 mg l- 1. Duplicate tanks were used for each <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> treatment. The first experiment was carried out with duration at six weeks, and utilized adult tilapia (258 ± 0. 3 g, mean±SEM). Fishes were fed six times in 24 hr photoperiod at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> (55, 70, 85, 100 and 115 % where 2. 25 % body weight per day as 100 % satiation). Daily weight gain was predicted assuming that the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1. 1 g feed dry matter (DM) intake per g gain. Analysis of variance showed that 55 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> is like to be proficient for FCR at 1. 01. Energy content of tilapia was significantly higher at 100 - 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and intermediate at 55 to 85 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Nitrogen retention was significantly higher at limited <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> (55 %). Apparent crude protein digestibility was found significantly higher at 100 % satiation and intermediate at 70, 85 and 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> was at the 55 % level, corresponding to 1. 2 % a day. The second experiment was conducted over a 4 week period with juvenile tilapia (1. 1 ± 0. 02 g) fed 22 times in 24 hr photoperiod at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> (55, 70, 85, 100 and 115 % where 8 and 6 % body weight per day considered as 100 % satiation for 1 st and 2 nd two week, respectively). FCR was set at 0. 8 g DM intake per g gain. Growth rates were significantly higher at 85 - 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 66 to 0. 81) significantly lower at 55 - 85 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Whole-body dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, and energy contents were significantly elevated for the highest <b>feeding</b> <b>rates,</b> while ash was reduced. Nitrogen, phosphorus and energy retentions were significantly lowered at restricted feeding. The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was 6. 8 % a day for the first 2 weeks and 5. 1 % for the next two weeks. The third experiment was designed with 4 weeks feeding of juvenile tilapia (1. 1 ± 0. 02 g) in accordance with same frequency and photoperiod as same as second experiment. Fishes were fed at four declining and one fixed <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> 8 - 16 to 8 and 6 - 14 to 6 % body weight for 1 st and 2 nd two week respectively. Weight gain% and SGR were significantly higher at 10 - 8 and 8 - 6 to 16 - 8 and 14 - 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 66 to 0. 71) were significantly lower at 10 - 8 to 8 and 8 - 6 to 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, ash and energy content were significantly affected by declining <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and higher than initial body composition. Nitrogen and total phosphorus retentions were significantly higher at lesser feeding regime while energy retention was significantly higher at 12 - 8 and 10 - 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was to reduce feeding from 10 to 8 % a day for the first 2 weeks and from 8 to 6 % for the next two weeks. The fourth experiment was carried out at two week duration for larger tilapia (77. 9 ± 0. 03 g). Fishes were fed at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 % body weight a day) with same frequency and photoperiod as experiment 2 and 3. FCR was set at 0. 9 g DM intake per g gain. Growth rates were significantly higher at 3 to 5 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 86 to 0. 89) were significantly lower at 1 to 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Dry matter and energy content were significantly increased by <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> but ash content was significantly decreased as <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> increase. Nitrogen retention was significantly higher at 1 - 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while energy retention at 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was 3 % a day. In conclusion, correct <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> can be used for maximize growth and feed utilization for genetically improved Nile tilapia. Declining <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> is better than fixed <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and can be suitable for Juvenile tilapia (1. 1 g) at 10 - 8 % and 8 - 6 % for 1 st and 2 nd two week, respectively while 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> can be proper for tilapia between 80 and 115 g.

25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are <b>feed</b> <b>rate,</b> particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E
500|$|The {{wire feed}} unit {{supplies}} the electrode to the work, driving it through the conduit {{and on to the}} contact tip. [...] Most models provide the wire at a constant <b>feed</b> <b>rate,</b> but more advanced machines can vary the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> in response to the arc length and voltage. [...] Some wire feeders can reach feed rates as high as 30.5m/min (1200in/min), but feed rates for semiautomatic GMAW typically range from 2 to 10m/min (75 – 400in/min).|$|E
500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a constant voltage power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. [...] This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully.|$|E

500|$|Further {{developments}} in welding steel with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool {{as a result of the}} lower wire <b>feed</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire <b>feed</b> <b>rate)</b> within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E
500|$|In a {{continuous}} distillation, {{the system is}} kept in a steady state or approximate steady state. [...] Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. [...] Such constant quantities include feed input rate, output stream rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). [...] Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is normally maintained. [...] This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation, apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant.

Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.|$|E

At 10 ug/L of Cu and 50 ug/L only 50 % Artemia nauplii were eaten by mysis and 80 % by post larvae. Nevertheless, <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> of control samples (non-dosed larvae) were significantly higher than all exposed larvae even at lowest concentration of 10 ug/L of Cu and Cd. <b>Feeding</b> <b>rate</b> of mysis II,III and post larvae was not similar at any same dose of Cu and Cd...|$|R

The {{standard deviations of}} the measured <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> were 66 % and 75 % of the average values for the two experiments described above when no differentiation in the three tested factors (food source, parasite infection and body mass) was made (Figure  1, columns 1 and 8). The large {{variability in}}dicated a low statistical power in any tests of individual <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> of G. pulex at a daily resolution and thus {{the need for further}} work to understand and reduce intra-specific variability.|$|R
