5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
25|$|Lima in {{the early}} twentieth century was filled with musical theatre and many well known musicians made their home in Lima. Alomía Robles {{discovered}} that the theatre needed extras in the chorus line and offered himself so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> music for free and learn the operettas of that period.|$|E
500|$|Gary Gygax {{was born}} in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie [...] "Posey" [...] (Burdick) and Swiss {{immigrant}} and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name {{given to him by}} his mother after the actor Gary Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play. At age 7, he became a member {{of a small group of}} friends who called themselves the [...] "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move the family to Posey's family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey's family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's grandparents still lived.|$|E

60|$|As {{he hurried}} along with Bull, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> above <b>the</b> {{sound of the}} musketry the sharp crack of the field-guns from the {{opposite}} side of the river.|$|R
60|$|As {{he rushed}} downstairs two steps at a time, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> along <b>the</b> street the mighty howlings, {{to and fro}} of the Hooligan paper-sellers making a Boom.|$|R
500|$|On 16 December, {{working from}} the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began {{to break through the}} back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, {{returning}} to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him [...] "is the missus in?" [...] The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.|$|E
2500|$|In 1877, George Fredrick Muntz founded Christ Church Umberslade, a Baptist church off Spring Lane, Hockley Heath {{following}} his conversion to the Baptists cause. In later years, due to ill-health, {{he had a}} microphone system installed and linked to Umberslade Hall so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> services. The church {{is now in the}} ownership of Historic Chapels Trust ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1903 – Late in {{the last}} quarter, Fitzroy skipper Gerald Brosnan marked a pass from {{teammate}} Percy Trotter about thirty metres from goal with his team three points behind Collingwood. As {{he went back to}} line up his kick, the final bell rang. Brosnan's shot missed, but was so close that a Collingwood defender later claimed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> ball's lace brush the goal post.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{tried to}} pierce the {{darkness}} and mist, but it was impossible. He strained his ears, but all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was <b>the</b> occasional dropping of water from one leaf to another over his head.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> spoke, they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> whistle of {{the steamer}} rushing away from them.|$|R
60|$|It was snowing very hard; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{see nothing}} but a haze of tossing flakes, and the wind filled the valley with its roar. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> beck a few yards off.|$|R
2500|$|British war {{correspondent}} Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett {{witnessed the}} landing shortly after dawn from the transport Minneapolis. [...] While <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> fighting continuing at Anzac, Suvla was comparatively quiet and [...] "no firm hand appeared to control this mass of men suddenly dumped on an unknown shore." [...] The British official history, written by Captain Cecil Aspinall-Oglander {{who was on}} Hamilton's staff, was blunt in its assessment; [...] "It was now broad daylight and the situation in Suvla Bay was verging on chaos." ...|$|E
2500|$|His ventriloquist act {{included}} a dummy named Danny [...] "Hooch" [...] Matador. In a TV Guide {{interview in the}} 1970s, {{he said that he}} had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the South Pacific. [...] He [...] swore that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> dummy calling for help as the ship sailed on, leaving him bobbing helplessly in the waves.|$|E
2500|$|Another on-air mishap had Thomas {{reading a}} story about President Eisenhower's visit to Hershey, Pennsylvania [...] "where he was greeted by the folks who make {{chocolate}} bars, with and without nuts." [...] ("Nuts" [...] is a euphemism for [...] "testicles.") [...] As Thomas read the next story, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> announcer breaking up with laughter in the New York City studio, which caused Thomas to break up, as well. [...] Air checks of some of Thomas' gaffes (as well as recreations of his [...] "bloopers") are available to collectors.|$|E
60|$|The exact {{locality}} of {{the fire}} was plain {{to him as he}} neared home. <b>He</b> soon <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of burning wood, and could smell the smoke from the conflagration.|$|R
6000|$|Here, too, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} the stream in the [...] dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet; but I am far from [...] content with this as being the spot the poet watched from.|$|R
60|$|At first <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> {{nothing but}} <b>the</b> {{movements}} of the horses, but presently came a low murmur from {{one corner of the}} loft.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1946, Stieglitz {{suffered}} a fatal stroke and went into a coma. O'Keeffe returned to New York and found Dorothy Norman was in his hospital room. She left and O'Keeffe was {{with him when he}} died. According to his wishes, a simple funeral was attended by twenty of his closest friends and family members. Stieglitz was cremated, and, with his niece Elizabeth Davidson, O'Keeffe took his ashes to Lake George and [...] "put him where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> water." [...] The day after the funeral, O'Keeffe took control of An American Place.|$|E
2500|$|Blocked by the National Assembly, Louis-Napoleon {{decided to}} take a {{different}} route. in public he blamed Thiers and the Assembly for restricting the right to vote and for refusing to alter the Constitution for a second term, and secretly brought loyal army forces to Paris. Early in the morning of 2 December 1851, in {{what became known as the}} December 1851 coup d'état, the army took up positions in key positions in Paris, and at six a.m. the commissioner of police, Hubault, appeared at his residence at Place Saint-Georges and placed him under arrest. [...] "But don't you know the law?" [...] Thiers protested. [...] "Do you know that you're violating the Constitution?" [...] Hubault replied, [...] "I do not have the mission of discussing this with you, and moreover you have more knowledge than me." [...] A carriage took Thiers to Mazas Prison. From his jail cell <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of gunfire as the soldiers loyal to Louis-Napoleon secured the city. On 9 December, he was transported to the German border and sent into exile.|$|E
2500|$|Through the maquis {{caused the}} Germans much difficulty, the guerrillas tended not to fare well in {{sustained}} combat. The SOE agent André Hue who was leading a maquis band in Brittany later recalled about the Battle of Saint Marcel as the firefight on 18 June 1944 at a farmhouse outside Saint Marcel {{he was using}} as his base: [...] "Now every weapon that the enemy possessed was {{brought to bear on}} our front line in a cacophony of shots and explosions which could not drown an even more sinister noise: the occasional crack of a single bullet. A man within feet of me slumped to the ground with blood spurting two feet into the air from the side of his neck [...] [...] [...] We had anticipated an infantry assault-possibly backed up with light armour-but snipers, a threat we had not met before, were difficult to counter. Within minutes of the first casualty, another seven of our men lay dying within the farm complex: all had been shot from long range." [...] As the snipers continued to cut down his men while <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of panzers coming up in the distance, Hue ordered his men to retreat into the woods under the cover of darkness while using his radio to call in a RAF airstrike that disorganised the Germans enough to make escape possible. Summarizing up the Battle of Saint Marcel, Hue wrote: [...] "The majority of the younger men had never been in battle, and seeing their friends' brains and guts oozing on to the grass and mud made them sick in the head and stomach. Just as terrifying to the young Frenchmen was the sight of those who were wounded and who yet had to die without help. I was not surprised that so many had enough. I was perhaps astonished that the number of defectors were so low".|$|E
60|$|After rowing {{for half}} an hour, the captain ordered them to cease, and to keep silence. Listening attentively, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>the</b> still night air the sound of oars; but whether the boats were towing the ships, or rowing independently, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell. Again the men set to work.|$|R
6000|$|Where <b>he</b> stood <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{see what}} was going on on deck unless perhaps the tops of the men's heads; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> scuffle, the mighty thuds, as if the ship were being knocked to pieces. I looked over: [...] "What is it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a great friend of Lord Byron while {{attending}} Harrow School. (Byron had claimed to love him [...] "ad infinitum" [...] and said that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "Clare" [...] without [...] "a murmur of the heart".) ...|$|R
60|$|Here <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{conversation}} between Bicker and Drossdell quite plainly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> tolling. He {{said over}} to himself {{the song that}} Brigid had taught him.|$|E
60|$|After {{sleeping}} {{for some}} hours, Godfrey awoke {{with a strange}} feeling of oppression. Outside <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> dogs whimpering.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{as he lay}} down, faint {{from his}} exertions, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> above <b>the</b> tread of {{a great number of}} men, {{followed}} by a tremendous musketry fire from the house. Once or twice he thought he heard some one come {{to the door of the}} outhouse; but if so, no one entered.|$|R
50|$|Ed Charles {{appears in}} the 2013 movie 42 (film), played by Dusan Brown. The scene depicts Charles' meeting with Jackie Robinson, when (after Jackie's train had long since departed) Charles dashed out and put his ear to the train tracks, enthusiastically declaring that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> train.|$|R
60|$|Alf's rigorously limited {{powers of}} comprehending Torpenhow"s special {{correspondence}} had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear,</b> through <b>the</b> boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside Suakin; <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots, and {{could smell the}} acrid wood-smoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, villain and shameless rogue!' The jewelled {{forefinger}} shook {{itself at}} him reprovingly; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> old lady's chuckle.|$|E
60|$|Stooping close {{under the}} window, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> murmur of voices, but could {{distinguish}} no words. He rejoined his companion.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{breathing}} of the banth at his heels. Not {{for much}} longer could he delay the encounter.|$|E
60|$|For all the rudeness of that interruption, Malloring felt a stir of interest. He himself liked birds. Unfortunately, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> {{nothing but}} <b>the</b> general chorus of their songs.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{he stopped}} the engine and listened. At first, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> only <b>the</b> ripple of the tide across some hidden shoal and the wash of the languid swell upon the {{invisible}} beach; but after a time a measured thud {{came out of the}} distance, and he knew that it was the beat of a steamer's screw.|$|R
50|$|The album {{sleeve and}} other sources {{indicate}} that Ringo Starr played Hammond organ on this track, an unusual instrument for the Beatle drummer. Mark Lewisohn reported that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> organ and that Hammond organ was not listed on the session tape box. Starr plays quick two-note vamps in the choruses.|$|R
