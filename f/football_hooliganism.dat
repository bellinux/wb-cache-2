5|$|In 1930, Chelsea {{featured}} {{in one of}} the earliest football films, The Great Game. One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington. Owing to the notoriety of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also {{featured in}} films about <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism,</b> including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od juče made an episode in which Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nikšić for qualification of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting {{in the death of}} a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West Ham and Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E
5000|$|A.F.C.A (also styled as [...] " [...] *A.F.C.A (Can't Be Stopped) [...] ") is a {{brand of}} urban {{lifestyle}} clothing founded by the late Sven Westendorp, a Dutch fashion designer, graffiti artist and famed supporter of association football club AFC Ajax. His brand has been popular since the mid 2000s and moved into the mainstream urban culture in the late 2000s. It is most often associated with association football. The style is based on graffiti art, hip-hop, association <b>football</b> culture, <b>hooliganism</b> and Ajax Amsterdam.|$|R
500|$|The {{actions of}} Bremner and Keegan were officially {{condemned}} and repercussions followed, initial statements to express [...] "great disappointment" [...] being made next day by both Ted Croker, FA Secretary, and Alan Hardaker, Football League Secretary. Croker, {{who had a}} greater concern about the impact on <b>football</b> of widespread <b>hooliganism,</b> was quoted as saying: [...] "We {{are trying to make}} football more acceptable to a wider range of people. Football will survive, but players must learn they cannot throw punches at each other".|$|R
40|$|Hooligans {{telling their}} own story {{represent}} {{a new voice}} in the sports narrative: the hooligan memoir. While this is a comparatively new phenomenon in Sweden, this literary genre has a long and productive history in England under the name hit and tell. The {{purpose of this article}} is to expound on the pop cultural expressions of hooliganism in Sweden, as epitomized by four hooligan memoirs. The article explores <b>football</b> culture, <b>hooliganism,</b> violence, masculinity and media in Sweden, as it is imperative to the understanding of hooliganism that it is analysed in the contexts in which it occurs. Research has demonstrated that hooliganism and violence in football and supporter culture have become increasingly visible in popular culture over the last few years. The article shows how hooligan culture is created in dynamic interaction between media, political reactions and cultural praxis, arguing that the cultural praxis of hooliganism is manifested through actual fights and, to an even greater extent, the various media narratives surrounding the hooligan subculture presented in the four memoirs...|$|R
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E

25|$|The 1977 {{match is}} memorable less for what {{happened}} during the game itself as {{for what happened}} on the park after the game.

40|$|Football {{violence}} {{has been a}} global problem for decades. A new way to approach the phenomenon comes from the theory of identity fusion, an extreme form of social bonding implicated in personally costly pro-group behaviours. Using British and Brazilian fan cultures to illustrate, this article discusses {{the ways in which}} identity fusion can help understandings of <b>football</b> violence. While <b>hooliganism</b> in the UK and the phenomenon of torcidas organizadas in Brazil operate under culturally distinct loci, the fundamental cognition underlying the extreme behaviours exhibited by both may be remarkably similar. Through this discussion, the football landscape is shown to offer researchers unique opportunities for understanding culture and the human psyche more broadly...|$|R
40|$|The New Media and Hooliganism: Constructing Media Identities. This {{paper will}} focus on the <b>football</b> culture, <b>hooliganism</b> and new media. The main target is the {{production}} of the picture of hooliganism on Internet, as well as the consumption of this “picture”. The paper, will thereby, examine the relation between “The old media”, ”the new media” and ”hooliganism”. This discussion will be related to an analysis of the website www. sverigescenen. com, a Swedish online magazine. A central question is: How are different pictures/images of the hooligans constructed and described in the new media landscape? And does this contemporary picture differ from the “old medias” images of the hooligans? In this respect, Nordic criminologists have informed about the power and the influence of media. They have - close to a moral panic - uphold various social evils that have normally and frequently been related to the power of media in general. This power can be used to induce a fear amongst ordinary people; a fear of criminal act. This influence on the moral discourse could, in the extension, maintain a fear that is out of all proportion to actual risks. Previous research has in general indicated that mass media has a great impact on the (re-) production of the “narrative stories” of hooliganism and hooligans. Importantly, the new media landscape creates new conditions for this “narrative picture” of hooliganism, {{due to the fact that}} both supporters and the hooligans themselves are active and vigorous media producers. This "new" situation of participation/engagement involvement in the media production will expand and transform the research on the media process, focusing both on producing and consuming media. In this light, the new media construction of hooliganism stand out as an important subject...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{research}} problem: Football {{is the most}} popular sport in the world and is influenced by stakeholders with different perspectives and interests. The problems with sporting and financial results are a much-debated issue in Sweden at the moment because the majority of all clubs in Allsvenskan have suffered a severe operational loss, which is becoming a serious threat to their existence. The sporting results have also got worse and Allsvenskan is rapidly falling on the UEFAranking. To change this negative trend, an increase in revenues among the Swedish clubs is necessary and this thesis will examine how this increase could be realised. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to identify the structure of revenues in the clubs in Allsvenskan today and what sources of revenues that have the best potential to increase. It will also be examined if the increase in revenues is the solution to reach the long-term goal that Allsvenskan shall be ranked amongst the top 15 leagues in Europe in 2020. Delimitations: This thesis treats Swedish football clubs in the premier division. Five clubs have been interviewed by which four are now playing in Allsvenskan and one has been relegated. Only male clubs are being examined and the focus lies on generation of revenues. Some comparisons are drawn with other leagues, in order to give the readers a better understanding of what others have done in order to reach a successful concept. Method: This thesis is based on primary data from seven qualitative interviews which have been analysed and compared with existing theories about generation of revenues in order to find a connection and possibilities of improvement. Results and conclusions: 52 per cent of the revenues in 2010 were assignable to advertising/sponsorship and match day revenues. Most of the revenues can somehow be assigned to the stadium and that is where the greatest potential of an increase in revenues lies. The solution is not the actual ownership of the stadium, but to obtain the rights for sales and advertisement at the stadium. The clubs should focus on increasing the revenues they are able to improve, based on their own conditions. In order to do the climb on the UEFA-ranking, increased revenues are essential and a change in the structure of how contributions are distributed would be favourable. However, that would result in a different type of league where a few clubs would be in top on a regular basis and there is a big disunity among the clubs whether this is worth aiming at. Further studies: The following issues would be interesting for further studies because they are also much debated at the moment and fairly unexplored: -­‐ How are the costs distributed in the football clubs in Allsvenskan and what costs have the least connection to sporting success and can be reduced? -­‐ Do revenues have a correlation with sporting success in other sports around the world? -­‐ How would a change in taxation legislation affect football in Sweden and player salaries? -­‐ How would a change in legislation concerning integrity and public control affect <b>football</b> and <b>hooliganism...</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{was during}} this time that Leeds United fans gained an {{unwanted}} reputation across the country which tarnished the club's names. Incidents of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> were rife, and there were regular instances of British National Front members and supporters peddling their literature to spectators on their way and {{in and out of}} the stadium.|$|E
25|$|The rise of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> marred {{the game}} {{throughout}} the 1970s and 1980s, which {{contributed to a}} decline in match attendance. Other factors in falling attendances were the dismal economic conditions and rising unemployment which plagued the British economy for most of the 1970s and into the 1980s, with many clubs in the north of England being hit particularly hard.|$|E
25|$|West Ham {{fans have}} a {{tradition}} of violence and hooliganism. Their former ground, Upton Park, has also witnessed racism amongst fans and here <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> originated amongst bovver boys in the 1960s. Sympathisers of the National Front have handed out National Front leaflets outside Upton Park particularly following {{the launch of the}} National Front youth newspaper 'Bulldog' in 1977, and have successfully sold club memorabilia carrying 'NF' slogans and motifs.|$|E

The murderers were to be hanged, and most of them were. But on January 10, 532, two of them, a Blue and a Green, escaped and were taking refuge in the sanctuary of a church surrounded by an angry mob.|$|E
25|$|Paris Saint-Germain is {{the most}} popular {{football}} club in France ahead of arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is one of the club's most prominent supporters. Since the emergence of the Boulogne Boys in the 1980s, PSG fan groups or ultras have been linked to <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> PSG's Boulogne Boys, considered one of the oldest hooligan groups in France, took their British neighbours as dubious role models and violence escalated in the early 1990s. PSG owners Canal+, France's premium pay channel, even tried to break up the Boys without success.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, major riots {{occurred}} {{when a young}} basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game. Another set of riots occurred in 2015 {{in response to a}} pitch invasion during a football match. Although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit on the neck and later died at the hospital. A former Polish police officer justified this use of weapons as a means to combat <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> Protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic.|$|E
25|$|Tyndall's new BNP {{absorbed the}} {{membership}} of the British Democratic Party, a small British nationalist party led by Anthony Reed Herbert which was attempting to distance itself from neo-nazism, and which had itself earlier split from the NF. Also joining were members of the Constitutional Movement, another NF splinter group who had distanced themselves from fascism and violent subcultures such as <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> These smaller nationalist parties attempting to modernise their image joined Tyndall's NNF through the Committee for Nationalist Unity (1981), which acted as a front to draw members from similar modernising nationalist organizations. However, despite Tyndall's attempt to distance the BNP from fascism, several individuals of the disintegrating British Movement were allowed to join. At its formation in 1982, the BNP had 2500 members, most of whom had joined from the Constitutional Movement through the Committee for Nationalist Unity. Eddy Morrison and his minor Leeds-based nationalist party merged with the BNP later that year.|$|E

500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s in particular, Chelsea {{supporters}} {{were associated with}} <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> The club's [...] "football firm", originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, and subsequently as the Chelsea Headhunters, were nationally notorious for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as West Ham United's Inter City Firm and Millwall's Bushwackers, before, during and after matches. The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them from invading the pitch, a proposal that the Greater London Council rejected.|$|E
500|$|Football in England {{had reached}} its nadir in 1985 as clubs were banned from European {{competition}} {{for five years}} following the Heysel Stadium disaster. In the same year, the Kenilworth Road riot – scuffles between fans of Millwall and Luton Town – resulted in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government setting up a [...] "war cabinet" [...] to combat <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> Incidents like the aforementioned tarnished the sport's reputation, but commercial interest grew. In August 1988, ITV paid £44 million over four seasons to broadcast live First Division matches. The arrangement came about as British Satellite Broadcasting withdrew its joint offer with the BBC, unhappy at how the clubs were run. By November 1988 the government issued a broadcasting shakeup, which aided the growth of multichannel satellite television. ITV's contract therefore acted as a precursor to rising broadcasting deals and growing pressures to keep the top clubs in line.|$|E
500|$|Oxford United's {{board of}} {{directors}} unanimously supported Maxwell's proposed amalgamation at a board meeting held on 20 April 1983. Their only reservation was regarding the name; they preferred [...] "Thames Valley United". The chairman of the Football League, Jack Dunnett, described Maxwell's proposal as [...] "a bold and imaginative move which I'll be watching with interest". Meanwhile, Maxwell re-entered talks with Oxford City Council over local stadium sites, repeating his preference for the Marston location. The council again refused. The mayor of Didcot, a small town about halfway between Oxford and Reading, suggested that Thames Valley Royals could build a ground there, on a site {{that had already been}} picked out for non-League amateurs Didcot Town. Wallingford, a similar proposition just east of Didcot, was also proposed. The residents of neither Didcot nor Wallingford showed much interest in hosting Thames Valley Royals home matches, partly because they were concerned about <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> {{reached its}} height in the 1970s and 80s. West Ham's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm {{were at the}} {{forefront}} of the trouble, not just against each other, but against the police and firms associated with other football teams. In 1972, the two clubs played each other in a testimonial match for Millwall defender Harry Cripps, who began his career at West Ham. The game was marred by intense fighting between the two club's hooligan firms, both inside and outside the ground. Four years later, a Millwall supporter, Ian Pratt, died at New Cross railway station after falling out of a train during a fight with some West Ham fans. After the incident West Ham hooligans constructed the chant, [...] "West Ham boys, we've got brains, we throw Millwall under trains." [...] Millwall fans waited patiently for two years for revenge, until West Ham were relegated to the Second Division. Prior to their next meeting with the Hammers on 7 October 1978, leaflets were distributed at Millwall's home matches bearing the words: [...] "A West Ham fan must die to avenge him." [...] The police responded with an unprecedented show of force for the game at Upton Park, which West Ham won 3–0. Some 500 officers controlled the crowd, carrying out extensive searches and strict segregation.|$|E
500|$|The 1985 Kenilworth Road riot, {{after an}} FA Cup sixth-round match between Luton Town and Millwall on 13 March 1985, {{became one of}} the worst and widely {{reported}} incidents of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> to date. On that night, approximately 20,000 people packed into a ground that usually only held half that number to watch Luton beat Millwall 1–0. Numerous pitch invasions, fighting in the stands and missile-throwing occurred, of which one such object hit Luton's goalkeeper Les Sealey. It led to a ban on away supporters by Luton from their Kenilworth Road ground for four years. Luton were asked by Millwall to make the Wednesday night match all-ticket, but this was ignored. As a result, rival hooligan firms gained access to the stadium. As well as the Millwall hooligans and those belonging to Luton's firm the MIGs, many of the 31 fans arrested after the violence were identified as being from Chelsea's Headhunters firm and West Ham United's Inter City Firm. The FA commissioned an inquiry which concluded that it was [...] "not satisfied that Millwall F.C. took all reasonable precautions in accordance with the requirements of FA Rule 31(A)(II)." [...] A £7,500 fine was levied against Millwall, though this was later withdrawn on appeal. The penalty that Millwall faced was perhaps that the club's name was now [...] "synonymous with everything that was bad in football and society".|$|E
500|$|The Milton Keynes {{idea was}} very poorly {{received}} by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as [...] "tearing the club from its most loyal supporters". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered {{a plane to}} fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading [...] "Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, {{to invest in the}} club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. [...] "The directors want our support and our money," [...] said Tom Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, [...] "but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business {{so that it can be}} taken away from us?" ...|$|E
500|$|English {{football}} {{had gone}} {{through a number of}} serious incidents related to <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> throughout 1985. In March, a major riot had occurred during an FA Cup tie between Luton Town and Millwall; {{on the final day of}} the English domestic season, the Second Division game between Birmingham City and Leeds United was marred by the death of a 14-year-old Birmingham fan during rioting before the game, while just two days after Scotland's qualifying game in Iceland, the Heysel Stadium disaster had occurred prior to the 1985 European Cup Final, which had led to English clubs being banned from European competition by UEFA. Although this did not affect England in international football (though there were discussions in regards to their participation in the 1988 European Championships [...] ), nor did it have any implication for either the Scottish Football Association (SFA) or FAW over their clubs' participation in Europe, there were fears, voiced by Jock Stein among others, that any trouble by supporters at what would be a highly charged game in Cardiff, with not only what was riding on the result, but also that it was a Home International, would provide an excuse for the British government, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to extend the measures it was putting in place to crack down on hooliganism in England to Scotland and Wales. Indeed, as a result of Heysel, the Belgian government banned football teams from the whole of the United Kingdom on 1 June 1985, with the ban only lifted in December 1986.|$|E
500|$|Millwall have {{averaged}} a gate close to 12,000 per home game over their 86 {{seasons in the}} Football League, while the club have spent the majority of that time yo-yoing {{back and forth between}} the second and third tiers of English football. Originally based in the East End of London, the club moved across the River Thames in 1910 to south east London and support is drawn from the surrounding areas. The club and fans have a historic association with <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism,</b> which came to prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s with a firm known originally as F-Troop, eventually becoming more widely known as the Millwall Bushwackers, who were one of the most notorious hooligan gangs in England. On five occasions The Den was closed by The FA and the club has received numerous fines for crowd disorder. The BBC documentary Panorama was invited into the club by Millwall in 1977 to show the hooligan reputation was a myth and being blown out of proportion by reporting. Instead the BBC portrayed hooliganism as being deeply rooted in Millwall, and attempted to link them to the far-right political party National Front. The show was extremely damaging for the club. Former club chairman Reg Burr once commented: [...] "Millwall are a convenient coat peg for football to hang its social ills on", an example being the reporting of convicted murderer Gavin Grant. Although he had played for eight different clubs, playing his fewest number of games (four) for Millwall, and was signed to Bradford City at the time, the BBC used the headline, [...] "Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder".|$|E
500|$|Oxford's fiercest rivalry is with Swindon Town, with Reading seen as {{the other}} {{significant}} rival team (both are about 30 miles from Oxford). [...] To a lesser extent, Wycombe Wanderers, Luton Town and Northampton Town are also seen as rivals. [...] The rivalry with Swindon stems from the clubs' close proximity, {{as well as the}} fact they have played each other 55 times since 1962. Oxford (Headington) and Swindon met a few times in non-competitive fixtures before 1962. The earliest match on record was a friendly in the 1950–51 season at Headington. They also played each other in 1954–55 both home and away, and at Headington during 1958–59. All programmes are fairly scarce, with the single sheet issued at Swindon being very rare. The 1962–63 game was a testimonial, with the first league meetings coming in 1965–66. [...] During the height of <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism,</b> trouble flared up between the sets of fans. In 1998, 19 Swindon supporters were arrested during a match at the County Ground, while in 2002 there was an incident between supporters after Oxford fans returned from an away fixture. In 2011, vandals burned the initials STFC into the Kassam Stadium's pitch. Oxford fans use nicknames when talking about Swindon such as moonraker, in reference to the myth that they tried to rake the reflection of the moon out of a pond. The rivalry with Reading was heightened during the chairmanship of Robert Maxwell, because of his desire to merge the two clubs. This was met with strong opposition from both sets of fans, with United supporters staging a [...] "sit-in" [...] on the pitch before a game against Wigan in protest. Despite being the second team in the city, there is less rivalry with Oxford City because of their lower position in the pyramid system (there have been no competitive league matches between the two since 1959).|$|E
2500|$|Owing to {{the notoriety}} of the [...] "Rangers Inter City Firm", a {{football}} firm {{associated with the}} club, Rangers have also featured in TV Documentaries and books about <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism,</b> including Series 1 Episode 5 of The Real Football Factories presented by English actor Danny Dyer on Bravo in 2006 where he visits his first Old Firm match and meets football casuals from Rangers, Celtic, Aberdeen, Hibernian, Dundee United and Dundee.|$|E

2500|$|Chandler was {{not pleased}} with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own {{material}} and a change of image. The band adopted a skinhead look {{as an attempt to}} gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend but this also added an unwelcome association with <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism.</b> Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having [...] "toughs" [...] in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of Shape of Things to Come which despite a performance on United Kingdom music show Top of the Pops, failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|Manchester City {{supporters}} are distinguishable by their sky blue, a colour {{which is only}} used {{by a handful of}} professional football clubs in England. The City supporters' song of choice is a rendition [...] "Blue Moon" [...] and are famous for their inflatables, normally yellow bananas which are still occasionally seen today at various games, often when City are on a cup run. The inflatables were initially started as a humorous laugh by numerous City fans after a City player Imre Varadi was nicknamed banana hence the inflatable bananas. Other inflatables soon followed aimed at putting goodwill back into football during the dark days of English <b>football</b> <b>hooliganism</b> and stadium riots and the craze soon caught on with other clubs following suit and even dressing up the inflatable bananas.|$|E
