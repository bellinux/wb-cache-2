AIM: To compare laparoscopic and minilaparotomy {{cholecystectomy}} in {{the treatment}} of cholelithiasis. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials, which included studies from four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Lilacs) was performed. The keywords used were "Cholecystectomy", "Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic" and "Laparotomy". The methodological quality of primary studies was assessed by the Grade system. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were included, totaling 2043 patients, 1020 in Laparoscopy group and 1023 in Minilaparotomy group. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy dispensed shorter length of hospital stay (p< 0. 00001) and return to work activities (p< 0. 00001) compared to minilaparotomy, and the minilaparotomy shorter operative time (p< 0. 00001) compared to laparoscopy. Laparoscopy decrease the risk of postoperative pain (NNT= 7) and infectious complications (NNT= 50). There was no statistical {{difference between the two groups}} regarding conversion (p= 0, 06) and surgical reinterventions (p= 0, 27), <b>gall</b> <b>bladder's</b> <b>perforation</b> (p= 0, 98), incidence of common bile duct injury (p= 1. 00), surgical site infection (p= 0, 52) and paralytic ileus (p= 0, 22).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of {{patients}} with an intact <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> develop acute cholecystitis or have <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stone formation after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy may affect <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility. AIMS: To prospectively evaluate longterm effect of endoscopic sphincterotomy on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility. PATIENTS: Thirty two patients with an intact <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> (15 with and 17 without <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones) who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. METHODS: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> function was examined before and at from seven days to five years after sphincterotomy. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume, at fasting and after caerulein administration, was determined by ultrasonography. RESULTS: After endoscopic sphincterotomy, the enlarged orifice remained patent during a five year follow up period. One patient with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones subsequently developed acute cholecystitis, the remaining being asymptomatic. In the patients before sphincterotomy, particularly in those with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones, the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> showed larger fasting volume and lower caerulein stimulated maximum contraction than normal controls. Throughout five years after sphincterotomy, fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> decreased and its maximum contraction increased, regardless of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones; {{significantly different from the}} values before sphincterotomy (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic sphincterotomy decreases fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and increases its contraction ability for a long period.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Perforation of {{the gall}} bladder {{represents}} a rare, but life-threatening complication of cholecystitis. Clinical presentation may vary between severe peritonism in acute perforation and absence of symptoms in subacute or chronic progression of perforation.

40|$|Background: Perforation of {{the gall}} bladder with cholecystohepatic {{communication}} {{is a rare}} cause of liver abscess. We are reporting here six rare cases of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>perforation</b> with variable clinical presentations. Materials and Methods: Most patients presented with right hypochondrium pain and fever but two patients presented with only pain in the abdomen. Ultrasonography (USG) and Computed Tomography (CT) were used for diagnosis. The patients were also successfully treated. Results: There was a <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>perforation</b> with cholecystohepatic communication, leading to liver abscess formation in most cases on USG and CT.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> {{functions}} are modulated by neurones intrinsic to the organ. Data {{are available on}} the neurochemical composition of intrinsic and extrinsic nerves innervating the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> but are lacking on specific functional classes of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> neurones. AIMS: To characterise the intrinsic motor neurones of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and identify their roles using pharmacological techniques. METHODS: Retrograde tracing from the possum <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle in vitro allowed identification of intrinsic motor neurones. Subsequently, their content of choline acetyltransferase and nitric oxide synthase, markers of acetylcholine and nitric oxide containing neurones, was established using immunohistochemical techniques. Organ bath pharmacology was used to evaluate neurotransmission by acetylcholine and nitric oxide in <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle strips. RESULTS: Innervation of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> musculature by neurones of both the muscular and serosal plexuses was demonstrated. A large proportion (62 %) of these motor neurones were immunoreactive for nitric oxide synthase. All <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> neurones showed immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase. Organ bath pharmacology confirmed the neuroanatomical data, showing acetylcholine and nitric oxide mediating neurotransmission to the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> musculature.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>perforation</b> is {{associated}} with high mortality rates and therefore must be recognised and managed promptly. We present an unusual presentation of spontaneous <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>perforation.</b> Case presentation: An elderly lady with multiple medical co-morbidities was admitted with sepsis following a fall. Initial assessment lead to a diagnosis of pneumonia, however a rapidly expanding right flank mass was incidentally noted during routine nursing care. Imaging studies were inconclusive, however incision and drainage of the mass revealed bile stained pus draining cutaneously from an acutely inflamed gallbladder. The patient made a good recovery following surgery, and was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Discussion: Despite focussed post-hoc history taking she denied any prodromal symptoms of cholecystitis. In addition to reporting an unusual cause for a common presentation, we highlight {{the importance of a}} full body examination in the context of sepsis, regardless of whether the source has been identified. In addition, we advocate that surgical intervention in sepsis should not be delayed by imaging in cases where an abscess is suspected. Conclusions: Percutaneous abscesses arising from the gallbladder are a rare but potentially serious consequence of acute cholecystitis, and may present {{in a wide variety of}} locations. Therefore it is imperative to conduct a full body inspection in the septic patient, even when a source has been identified...|$|E
40|$|Background—Nitric oxide {{is a major}} {{neurotransmitter}} in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) pathways. NANC inhibitory innervation {{has been}} shown in human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle in vitro; the role of nitric oxide in human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying however is undefined.  Aims—To study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying in healthy subjects using a randomised, double blind, crossover, placebo controlled design.  Methods—Ultrasonographic <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume was measured in the fasting state in eight healthy volunteers after randomised administration of either glyceryl trinitrate 1200 µg buccal spray or placebo spray. On two further occasions, after randomised administration of either glyceryl trinitrate 1200 µg buccal spray or placebo spray, <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volumes were also measured after a liquid test meal.  Results—Glyceryl trinitrate significantly increased fasting <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume to a mean of 114 % (SEM 5 %) of pretreatment volume (p= 0. 039).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} {{reviewed}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma in patients who underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstone disease. METHODS: A retrospective study of demographical and clinical information for patients who underwent a cholecystectomy and operative cholangiogram for gallstones predominantly in three major hospitals located in the northern area of Melbourne was carried out. RESULTS: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinomas were observed in 14 patients (3. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 8 - 5. 3 %) consisting of 11 women and three men of median age 78. 5 years (interquartile range: 77 - 81) {{from a series of}} 439 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1 - 2. The {{results of the present study}} show that primary carcinoma of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> in this descriptive retrospective cohort was always associated with single or multiple cholesterol gallstones that were impacting on the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> wall. Cholesterol 'solitaire' gallstones were ovoid in shape with diameters > 3 cm along their longest axis, whereas multiple cholesterol gallstones varied in size and number from two or three large stones (1 - 2 cm), to numerous smaller stones (variable size to 0. 5 cm). No patient with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma had either brown or black pigment gallstones. CONCLUSION: It is postulated that <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma may be intimately associated with large or numerous cholesterol gallstones that in the first instance may interfere with the mechanical functioning of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> The size as well as the number of gallstones present in the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> may contribute significantly to the promotion of a gallstone filling defect of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> that may cause chronic mechanical damage to the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucosa.

40|$|Abstract Spontaneous {{perforations}} of the biliary tract {{are rare}} in adults {{and even more}} so during pregnancy. Perforation of the gall bladder is a potentially fatal complication of cholecystitis. The infrequency of perforation in the setting of calculous disease of the gall bladder is probably due to the thickened wall of the organ that has long been the seat of chronic inflammation. Common bile duct perforations have been reported in adults most commonly in association with choledocholithiasis. The diagnosis of biliary tract perforations is often delayed due to their non specific symptoms, which results in high morbidity. Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy are mandatory to alleviate this condition. Delayed diagnoses and treatment may have more serious consequences for pregnant women than for other patients. Very few cases of biliary tract perforations have been reported in pregnant women. We report two such cases in pregnancy: first of a <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> <b>perforation</b> associated with cholelithiasis and the second of a common bile duct perforation in pregnancy in which no apparent cause was found. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: An {{impaired}} contractility {{has been}} suggested as {{a contributor to the}} increased incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis, but the few studies on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying in cirrhotics offered contradictory results. Ingestion of a meal triggers the physiological pathway of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying; therefore, it was decided to analyse postprandial kinetics by investigating simultaneously the rates of gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying of a mixed meal in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying were measured using ultrasound techniques after a solid-liquid meal (14 g fat, 425 kcal) in 24 patients with liver cirrhosis and in 12 controls. None of the subjects had <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> disease. Sequential changes in cross sectional area of the gastric antrum and in <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume were represented as a monoexponential process after the test meal. Cirrhotic patients were analysed according to the severity of disease (Child classes). The presence of portal gastropathy was assessed by endoscopy. Differences between groups were assessed using the two tailed Student's t test for unpaired observations and the correlations by linear regression (Pearson's coefficient). RESULTS: It was found that gastric emptying after the solid-liquid meal was delayed in cirrhotic patients compared with controls. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying was significantly diminished in cirrhotic patients: the area under curve was greater in Child A (p = 0. 01), Child B (p = 0. 04), and Child C (p = 0. 014) cirrhotics compared with controls. No correlation was found between the variables of gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> refilling began earlier in cirrhotics than in controls, before completion of gastric emptying. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the lack of coordination between gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying in liver cirrhosis. They also support the hypothesis that diminished <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contractility might contribute to the increased gallstone formation in liver cirrhosis...|$|R
