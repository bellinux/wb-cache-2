50|$|In 1998, discussions {{amongst the}} Directors-General of the Public Administration of the EU Member States in the <b>European</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Administration</b> Network (EUPAN) {{revealed}} {{that there was}} a need for a common European quality framework that could be used across the public sector as a tool for organisational self-assessment. As a consequence of this, it was decided that this quality framework should be jointly developed {{under the aegis of the}} Innovative Public Services Group (IPSG), an informal working group of national experts set up by the Directors General of the EUPAN network. The first version of the CAF was then developed in 1998 and 1999 by the IPSG and with the support of the European Foundation of Quality Management (EFQM), the Speyer Academy (which organised the Speyer Quality Award for the public sector in the German-speaking European countries) and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA).|$|E

40|$|What {{intellectual}} influence, if any, have British {{public administration}} scholars had on their American counterparts since World War II? In this article, the author briefly reviews the major areas {{of theory and}} research in the British study of publication administration, further identifying important contributions by British scholars {{in the areas of}} modernist-empiricism, the new public management, regulation, policy networks and governance, and interpretive theory. Although there is a discernible American influence on British public administration, there is little British impact on U. S. public administration; nowadays it is a one-way street. Increasingly, British scholars are involved in a growing community of <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> scholars with whom they share active, two-way connections. Recent European developments suggest that American and <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> academics are growing further apart. Due to the immense strength of modernist-empiricism throughout American universities, plus the interpretive turn to a European epistemology of "blurred genres," these twin, traditionally self-referential, communities seem to be parting company with an attendant danger that future intellectual engagement may be a dead end.

40|$|This {{research}} work examines {{conflict of interest}} papers written by the EU and the OECD in collaboration with their subsidiary organisations and expert consultation. An attempt is made to evaluate them against the main features of <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration.</b> This is accomplished by examining two other papers, also produced by EU and the OECD, in order to uncover first, the contextual attributes of European governance, and second, its consistency with conflict of interest guidelines and recommendations. In other words, {{the structure of the}} work is built on two main pillars: conflict of interest data and related concepts (principles, norms, themes), plus the context of <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration,</b> together with its key developments and characteristic traits. The data pertain to the period from the 1990 s until 2010. To summarise, four papers are divided into two groups: the first group represents wider contextual descriptions of European governance, and the other deals directly with the phenomenon of conflict of interest in the administration of public affairs. The results draw an ambivalent picture. The context of European governance has partly remodelled its practices to follow mainstream managerial trends, and partly retained its fundamental core; such developments have a compound impact on the effective application of the conflict of interest model in practice. The Critical Management Study with its poststructural stream is chosen to be the main theoretical underpinning. Carol Bacchi’s ‘what is the problem represented to be?’ (WPR) technique of policy analysis both supplements the Critical Management Study through its poststructural stance, and is used as a methodological tool...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{salience}} of public administration reforms in Europe, there is surprisingly little systematic research identifying how and whether public sector reforms have been implemented, and with what outcomes. This introductory chapter introduces the topic of public administration reform, {{as well as the}} general approach and purpose of the book. With an aim of evaluating public administration reforms in different European countries, three reform paradigms are distinguished. The first has the implementation of Weberian-style structures and processes at its core; the second is the introduction of the New Public Management, and the third brings together elements of Weberianism with aspects of NPM. A secondary objective is to study convergence and divergence in <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> reform through a comparison across a large set of European countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of new working cultures, commitment to best quality and customer satisfaction in public administration through the {{adoption of}} the principles of Transformational Government is an ongoing process in Europe. <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> is thus moving from a model characterized by bureaucracy and inefficiency, towards a new model where quality, customer satisfaction, efficiency and reduction of administrative burden are the issues at stake. This transformation relies strongly on the solid presence of ICT in public administration and government work; however, important societal changes are needed, such as the promotion of eInclusion and eSkills to ensure that citizens are not left behind in benefiting from the information society. The possibilities of transformational government are thus manifold: from efficiency gains to energy saving. Transformational Government,eInclusion,ICT,Reduction of Administrative Burden...|$|E

40|$|Through the {{increasing}} use of ICT, particularly with the enablement of interoperability and development of digital inclusion policies, public administrations across Europe are engaging in transformation processes, which aim at achieving a more efficient, effective, friendly, and citizenand business-centric delivery of public services. This approach, also known as "Transformational Government", has become a driving force for innovation and reduction of administrative burden in <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration,</b> taking advantage of the possibilities that the most recent technological developments such as the Web 2. 0 have opened. While the opportunities presented are enormous, there are also challenges to address in the implementation of such transformation processes that will be addressed in this article; in particular ensuring digital access for all citizens, and taking into account the multidimensionality of interoperability to enable sharing of governmental information across Europe...|$|E

The Bangemann Report calls attention to the important role played {{in the development of}} the information society by public administrations who should dedicate serious efforts and resources to the innovation and development of information as an added value with democratizing effects in society. The current situation of the <b>European</b> <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> information systems on the Internet is analyzed through a statistical bibliographic study measuring the following parameters: producers; subject coverage; services; whether of added value or not; the legal framework; electronic publications; use of the classic documentation tools to structure information; use of GIS; database management; date of creation; update frequency; implmentation of helps to locate information...|$|E
40|$|Public Service Motivation {{concept was}} {{developed}} in North America and focuses on specific motivations of public servants, such as employee satisfaction, organizational commitment, reward preferences, organizational and individual performance.

This strengthen the assertion for a diversified motivational strategy, which affect various types of motivation, while not losing sight of the public value that one organization shows and therefore valuing public service motivation as a specific contribution to work outcomes.
