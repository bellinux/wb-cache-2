40|$|Values {{are most}} {{generally}} some normative behaviours. They {{are expected to}} be internalized by the individuals of any society in the process of learning termed as socialization. Values are of vital importance to any society because they serve as criteria for selection of actions which are regarded as most valuable. Though one of the major aims of education is inculcation of values among the learners, a special drive on value education has become the need of the hour –given the abysmal pictures of value-crisis in the present consumerist society. Value-education refers to a programme of planned educational action aimed at the development of values and character of the learners. In order to build a democratic society, values like tolerance, self-respect, human dignity, secularism, compassion for others, human rights, practice of peace and non-violence, fellow-feeling, leadership- etc are of topmost importance. But unfortunately, present education system is producing only information-loaded men and women –not 'valueable human beings'. As a result, society is facing conflicts of different types that are out to erode the democratic <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> nation.

2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that we can call [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, it makes no sense to talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E

40|$|With {{wireless}} networking technologies extending {{into the}} <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> working and operating environments, proper handling of intermittent wireless connectivity and network disruptions is of significance. As {{the sheer number}} of potential opportunistic application continues to surge (i. e. wireless sensor networks, underwater sensor networks, pocket switched networks, transportation networks, and etc.), the design for an effective routing scheme that considers and accommodates the various intricate behaviors observed in an opportunistic network is of interest and remained desirable. While previous solutions use either replication or coding techniques to address the challenges in opportunistic networks, the tradeoff of these two techniques only make them ideal under certain network scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid scheme, named H-EC, to deal {{with a wide variety of}} opportunistic network cases. H-EC is designed to fully combine the robustness of erasure coding based routing techniques, while preserving the performance advantages of replication techniques. We evaluate H-EC against other similar strategies in terms of delivery ratio and latency, and find that H-EC offers robustness in worst-case delay performance cases while achieving good performance in small delay performance cases. We also discuss the traffic overhead issues associated with H-EC as compared to other schemes, and present several strategies that can potentially alleviate the traffic overhead of H-EC schemes...|$|R

What, then, was the secret spell of his success? The simplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it. His Lordship's plates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses, and at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their preparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably lessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance that every one at a French dinner is served on a cold plate. The reason of a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really, it is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior that it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner. The common white pottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the cafés, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour. Now, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been so often on the point <b>of</b> completion, the <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> unrivalled potteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found throughout France.
