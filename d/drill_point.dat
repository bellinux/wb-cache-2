Drilling experiments were conducted with <b>drill</b> <b>points,</b> namely standard twist drill, Zhirov-point drill, and multifacet drill, using wide range of spindle speed, and feed rate to analyse thrust force, delamination and surface roughness. At high spindle speed, cutting force is less and the special geometry improves {{the quality of the}} hole further, especially Zhirov <b>point</b> <b>drill.</b> Multifacet drill is found better as far as the delamination value is concerned.

The geophysical survey that resulted in the ground magnetic data was conducted for magnetic elements exploration. Firstly, RTP technique was applied for recognizing underground magnetic anomalies. RTP anomalies was classified to different populations based on this method. For this reason, <b>drilling</b> <b>points</b> determination with RTP technique was complicated. Next, C-A method was applied on the RTP-Magnetic-Anomalies (RTP-MA) for demonstrating magnetic susceptibility concentration. This identification was appropriate for increasing the resolution of the <b>drilling</b> <b>points</b> determination and decreasing the drilling risk, due to the economic costs of underground prospecting. In this study, the results of C-A Modeling on the RTP-MA are compared with 8 borehole data.

Two boreholes were drilled in magnetic susceptibility concentration, based on multifractal modeling data analyses, between 63 533. 1 and 66 296 nT.

However, it has been long recognized that such testing suffers {{from the fact that}} nominally similar drills with identical GP-twist drill design are subject to some variability in as-manufactured <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features, that can give rise to large differences in tool-life. In the present study a brief review is presented made of previous investigations which looked at the specifications and measurement of prominent <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features on GP-twist drills.

40|$|The general {{appearance}} of twist drills {{is similar to}} a 'spiral' drill design patented by Morse in 1863. In the past few decades there have been numerous attempts to improve the cutting process and chip removal via changes and modifications in the <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> geometry, the flute shape and surface coatings. It has been recognized that the <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> design features and the flute shape are geometrically linked.

However, little has been published for other twist drill modifications e. g. deep hole jobber (DHJ) drill design, although the cutting action in drilling appears to be similar for various twist drills involving the drill lips in oblique cutting and the chisel edge in orthogonal cutting. Thus, this paper was focused on studying geometrical differences between GPT and DHJ drill designs via distribution of rake angles along the drill lips and chisel edge. Moreover, the experimentally measured thrust and torque values for both GPT and DHJ drills, in coated and uncoated conditions, are presented to quantify and highlight total possible improvements that can be achieved by <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> modifications and surface coatings...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} issue of how stone drill points were {{manufactured}} at the Late Neolithic workshop of Bai Ben, Northeastern Vietnam, from a technological perspective, and with the aim of understanding the organisation of technology at the site. Within this organisational approach, the issue is investigated in a comprehensive manner from raw material procurement to drill manufacture, use, maintenance, and discard. Attribute based statistical methods are developed to observe the time-ordering of dimensional and morphological changes of classes of cores and drills with the ultimate aim of reconstructing the reduction sequences so that the position of <b>drill</b> <b>points</b> within these sequences is better identified. The analyses show that raw material used to produce <b>drill</b> <b>points</b> is variable in size as well as locally available and readily accessible in the region. The availability and the variation of raw material size are in turn shown to be key factors that strongly affect the whole process of core reduction at Bai Ben. It can be seen in both freehand and bipolar core populations {{that there is not a}} simple single reduction trajectory but a complex reduction process that involves reduction sequences of varying lengths. Raw material of different sizes could be transformed either by first employing freehand percussion followed by bipolar percussion, or by directly employing a bipolar technique. Cores could be discarded at many points along the reduction continuum, creating a complex pattern of core size and reduction intensity. In contrast to core reduction, drill reduction was not substantially influenced by raw material selection, but by the initial size and shape of drill blanks. This determined how much reduction was necessary to create a standardized product. The time-ordering of dimensional and morphological changes in various artefact classes thus permits us to understand the causes of assemblage variability at the site. This research represents the first application of a technological approach to the archaeological record of Vietnam. This study illustrates the benefits of conducting future technological investigations at the numerous other workshop sites known from Vietnam. It is argued that such investigations are required to build an understanding of the nature and importance of specialized lithic activities, trade, and exchange in this period of significant cultural change...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During the {{drilling}} of the bone, the temperature could increase above 47 degrees C and cause irreversible osteonecrosis. The result is weakened contact of implants with bone and possible loss of rigid fixation. The {{aim of this}} study was to find an optimal condition where the increase in bone temperature during bone drilling process would be minimal. [...] - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Influence of different drill parameters was evaluated on the increase of bone temperature. Drill diameters were 2. 5, 3. 2 and 4. 5 mm; drill speed 188, 462, 1, 140 and 1, 820 rpm; feed-rate 24, 56, 84 and 196 mm/min; <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> angle 80 degrees, 100 degrees and 120 degrees and external irrigation with water of 26 degrees C. [...] - RESULTS: Combinations of drill speed and drill diameter with the use of external irrigation produced temperatures far below critical. Without external irrigation, temperature values for the same combination of parameters ranged 31. 4 - 55. 5 degrees C. Temperatures above critical were recorded using 4. 5 mm drill with higher drill speeds (1, 140 and 1, 820 rpm). There was no statistical significance of different <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> angles on the increase or decrease of bone temperature.
