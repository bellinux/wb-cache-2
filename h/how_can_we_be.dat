2500|$|BarlowGirl again {{recorded}} with producer Otto Price for their third studio album <b>How</b> <b>Can</b> <b>We</b> <b>Be</b> Silent. The album {{was released on}} July 24, 2007. It debuted at No.1 on Billboard's Christian Chart and No.40 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, making it the first album by an all-female rock band {{to reach the top}} 40 on the Billboard 200 since [...] "Everything" [...] by the Bangles in 1989. Similarly to Another Journal Entry, this album was released in a special edition variant known as <b>How</b> <b>Can</b> <b>We</b> <b>Be</b> Silent Premium Edition. It was released concurrently with the regular edition, adding a new cover sleeve and bundling a 45-minute DVD. Singles from the album performed poorly on radio compared to earlier singles. The first, [...] "Here's My Life", was released in June 2007. It peaked at No. 12 on R's Christian contemporary hit radio charts and at No. 29 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart. [...] "Million Voices" [...] and [...] "I Believe In Love" [...] were released later that year, with no chart history available.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroethics also {{encompasses}} the ethical {{issues raised by}} neuroscience as it affects {{our understanding of the}} world and of ourselves in the world. [...] For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> held responsible for our actions? [...] A crime in the United States requires a [...] "guilty act" [...] and a [...] "guilty mind". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used {{in the criminal justice system}} and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. [...] The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.|$|E
