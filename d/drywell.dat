40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory's Nuclear Materials Storage Facility (NMSF) {{is being}} renovated for {{long-term}} storage of canisters {{designed to hold}} heat-generating nuclear materials. A fully passive cooling scheme, relying on the transfer of heat by conduction, free convection, and radiation has been proposed as a reliable means of maintaining material at acceptable storage temperatures. The storage concept involves placing radioactive materials, with a net heat-generation rate of 10 W to 20 W, inside a set of nested steel canisters. The canisters are, in placed in holding fixtures and positioned vertically within a steel storage pipe. Several hundred <b>drywells</b> are arranged in a linear array within a large bay and dissipate the waste heat to the surrounding air, thus creating a buoyancy driven airflow pattern that draws cool air into the storage facility and exhausts heated air through an outlet stack.

Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses of decontamination by natural aerosol processes are reported for 1, 000, 2, 000, 3, 000, and 4, 000 MW(th) pressurized water reactors and for 1, 500, 2, 500, and 3, 500 MW(th) boiling water reactors. Uncertainty distributions for the decontamination factors and decontamination coefficients as functions of time were developed in the Monte Carlo analyses by considering uncertainties in aerosol processes, material properties, reactor geometry and severe accident progression. Phenomenological uncertainties examined in this work included uncertainties in aerosol coagulation by gravitational collision, Brownian diffusion, turbulent diffusion and turbulent inertia. Uncertainties in aerosol deposition by gravitational settling, thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis, and turbulent diffusion were examined. Electrostatic charging of aerosol particles in severe accidents is discussed. Such charging could affect both the coagulation and deposition of aerosol particles. Electrostatic effects are not considered in most available models of aerosol behavior during severe accidents and cause uncertainties in predicted natural decontamination processes that could not be taken in to account in this work. Median (50 %), 90 and 10 % values of the uncertainty distributions for effective decontamination coefficients were correlated with time and reactor thermal power. These correlations constitute a simplified model {{that can be used to}} estimate the decontamination by natural aerosol processes at 3 levels of conservatism.

40|$|When {{members were}} first canvassed for {{participation}} in the Vadose Zone Expert Panel the stated purpose for convening the Panel was to review a controversial draft report, the SX Tank Farm Report. This report was produced by a DOE Grand Junction Project Office (GJPO) contractor, RUST Geotech, now MACTEC-ERS, for the DOE Richland Office (DOERL). Three meetings were planned for June, July and August, 1995 to review the draft report and to complete a Panel report by mid-September. The Expert Panel has found its efforts confounded by various non-technical issues. The Expert Panel has chosen to address some of the non-technical issues in this Preface rather than to dilute the technical discussion that follows in the body of this independent expert panel status report (Panel Report). Rather than performing a straightforward manuscript review, the Panel was asked to resolve conflicting interpretations of gamma-ray logging measurements performed in vadose zone boreholes (<b>drywells)</b> surrounding the high-level radioactive wastes of the SX tank farm. There are numerous and complex technical issues that must be evaluated before the vertical and radial extent of contaminant migration at the SX tank farm can be accurately assessed. When the Panel first met in early June, 1996, it quickly became apparent that the scientific and technical issues were obscured by policy and institutional affairs which have polarized discussion among various segments of the Hanford organization. This situation reflects the kinds of institutional problems described separately in reports by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS/NRC), The Hanford Tanks Environmental Impacts and Policy Choices and BmTiers to Science: Technical Management of the Department of Energy Environmental Remediation Program. The Vadose Zone Characterization Program, appears to be caught between conflicting pressures and organizational mandates, some imposed from outside DOE-RL and some self-imposed. The institutional problems they encountered include having both Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), the parent organization of the Vadose Zone Characterization Program and Environmental Restoration (ER), each under different regulatory controls and different organizational units, seeking to defend the status quo and discount many of the Panel`s conclusions and recommendations.

40|$|The {{overall goals}} of the Tank Farm Vadose Zone Project, led by CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc., are 1) to define risks from past and future single-shell tank farm activities, 2) to {{identify}} and evaluate the efficacy of interim measures, and 3) to aid, via collection of geochemical information and data, the future decisions that must {{be made by the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the near-term operations, future waste retrieval, and final closure activities for the single-shell tank Waste Management Areas (WMAs). For a more complete discussion of the {{goals of the}} Tank Farm Vadose Zone Project, see the overall work plan, Phase 1 RCRA Facility Investigation/Corrective Measures Study Work Plan for the Single-Shell Tank Waste Management Areas (DOE 1999). Specific details on the rationale for activities performed at WMA U are found in Crumpler (2003). To meet these goals, CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc., asked scientists from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to perform detailed analyses of vadose zone sediment collected within the U Single-Shell Tank Farm. Specifically, this report contains all the geochemical and selected physical characterization data collected on vadose zone sediment recovered from ten direct push characterization holes emplaced to investigate vadose zone contamination associated with potential leaks within the 241 -U Single-Shell Tank Farm. Specific tanks targeted during this characterization campaign included tanks 241 -U- 104 / 241 -U- 105, 241 -U- 110, and 241 -U- 112. Additionally, this report compiles data from direct push samples collected north of tank 241 -U- 201, as well as sediment collected from the background borehole (C 3393). After evaluating all the characterization and analytical data, {{there is no question that}} the vadose zone in the vicinity of tanks 241 -U- 104 and 241 -U- 105 has been contaminated by tank-related waste. This observation is not new, as gamma logging of <b>drywells</b> in the area has identified uranium contamination at the same depths interrogated by push hole C 5602. Given that the deepest sample string analyzed from push hole C 5602 contained trace activities of technetium- 99, it is obvious that tank waste contamination has impacted the vadose zone to at least a depth of 92 ft bgs at this location. However, the scope of the sampling campaign was to acquire additional samples to better understand the aerial extent of contamination in the U Tank Farm; therefore, future characterization activities (i. e., a borehole) will be required to understand the total vertical depth of contamination at this location...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of stormwater runoff {{is a particular}} challenge for communities in karst regions. Most guidelines for compliance with regulations for stormwater monitoring and mapping pertain to non-karst environments. It {{can be argued that}} effective stormwater management is even more essential to karst regions because stormwater receives little or no natural filtration as it is transferred through conduits in the subsurface and the buildup of pollutants underneath can be detrimental to community and environmental health if not effectively mitigated. Because of the limited resources available to determine how stormwater runoff carries potential pollutants across the surface before being transferred to the karst subsurface and then reentering back on the surface across the landscape, this study aims to use geographic information systems (GIS) to investigate this problem. The objectives of this study are twofold. The first objective is to understand the transport mechanisms for stormwater runoff and how the movement through karst systems differs from non-karst systems, especially in regards to the surface and subsurface interactions. The second objective is to develop a general procedure for predicting stormwater runoff pathways in karst regions using GIS technologies and spatial analysis techniques – including identifying which data and techniques are essential to analyze surface and subsurface processes - to improve stormwater monitoring effectiveness. The premise of this study is broken down into a conceptual model with three significant components: Surface Input (stormwater runoff on surface), Subsurface Transport (stormwater transport through subsurface), and Output to Surface (output of stormwater to the surface via springs). The first component utilizes Hydrological Analysis and Network Analysis techniques to determine stormwater runoff pathways from potential point-source pollutant sites across surface to injection points where runoff enters subsurface. The second component uses Spatial Interpolation Techniques and Hydrological Analysis to predict subsurface accumulation areas that collect runoff from injection points and subsurface conduit pathways to output locations. The third and final component examines the output of the runoff back to the surface and identifies the locations where stormwater runoff can be sampled. The analyses of the Surface Input component proved to be effective in predicting the behavior of stormwater runoff between pollutant sites and their corresponding injection points. The analyses of the Subsurface Transport captured the overall patterns in the inferred dye tracing pathways that were used as the control dataset. The Output to Surface established the linkages among RCRA sites, their corresponding injection points and ultimately their output springs. These findings are very useful in developing informed stormwater sampling strategies and plans. In future investigations, these results could be verified with stormwater sampling and additional dye tracings and can be improved in two ways: more complete datasets of all stormwater features in the area – especially springs and <b>drywells,</b> and a more extensive and equally distributed dataset for groundwater depths across the study area to create a more accurate interpolated potentiometric surface...|$|R
40|$|Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) {{developed}} an enhanced single-shell tank (SST) integrity project in 2009. An expert panel on SST integrity {{was created to}} provide recommendations supporting {{the development of the}} project. One primary recommendation was to expand the leak assessment reports (substitute report or LD- 1) to include leak causes and locations. The recommendation has been included in the M- 045 - 9 IF Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) as one of four targets relating to SST leak integrity. The 241 -SX Farm (SX Farm) tanks with leak losses were addressed on an individual tank basis as part of LD- 1. Currently, 8 out of 23 SSTs that have been reported to having a liner leak are located in SX Farm. This percentage was the highest compared to other tank farms which is why SX Farm was analyzed first. The SX Farm is comprised of fifteen SSTs built 1953 - 1954. The tanks are arranged in rows of three tanks each, forming a cascade. Each of the SX Farm tanks has a nominal I-million-gal storage capacity. Of the fifteen tanks in SX Farm, an assessment reported leak losses for the following tanks: 241 -SX- 107, 241 -SX- 108, 241 -SX- 109, 241 -SX- 111, 241 -SX- 112, 241 -SX- 113, 241 -SX- 114 and 241 -SX- 115. The method used to identify leak location consisted of reviewing in-tank and ex-tank leak detection information. This provided the basic data identifying where and when the first leaks were detected. In-tank leak detection consisted of liquid level measurement that can be augmented with photographs which can provide an indication of the vertical leak location on the sidewall. Ex-tank leak detection for the leaking tanks consisted of soil radiation data from laterals and <b>drywells</b> near the tank. The in-tank and ex-tank leak detection can provide an indication of the possible leak location radially around and under the tank. Potential leak causes were determined using in-tank and ex-tank information that is not directly related to leak detection. In-tank parameters can include temperature of the supernatant and sludge, types of waste, and chemical determination by either transfer or sample analysis. Ex-tank information can be assembled from many sources including design media, construction conditions, technical specifications, and other sources. Five conditions may have contributed to SX Farm tank liner failure including: tank design, thermal shock, chemistry-corrosion, liner behavior (bulging), and construction temperature. Tank design did not apparently change from tank to tank for the SX Farm tanks; however, there could be many unknown variables present in the quality of materials and quality of construction. Several significant SX Farm tank design changes occurred from previous successful tank farm designs. Tank construction occurred in winter under cold conditions which could have affected the ductile to brittle transition temperature of the tanks. The SX Farm tanks received high temperature boiling waste from REDOX which challenged the tank design with rapid heat up and high temperatures. All eight of the leaking SX Farm tanks had relatively high rate of temperature rise. Supernatant removal with subsequent nitrate leaching was conducted in all but three of the eight leaking tanks prior to leaks being detected. It is possible that no one characteristic of the SX Farm tanks could in isolation from the others have resulted in failure. However, the application of so many stressors - heat up rate, high temperature, loss of corrosion protection, and tank design - working jointly or serially resulted in their failure. Thermal shock coupled with the tank design, construction conditions, and nitrate leaching seem to be the overriding factors that can lead to tank liner failure. The distinction between leaking and sound SX Farm tanks seems to center on the waste types, thermal conditions, and nitrate leaching...|$|R
40|$|Stormwater {{management}} is required due to development and alteration {{of the natural}} environment. It is heavily regulated in Florida and at the national level. Over the last two decades, Low Impact Development (LID) has been promoted as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method of controlling urban runoff. Case studies, provided in Chapter 2, show that LIDs can restore watershed hydrology by balancing the water budget. The difference in runoff between pre-development and post-development appears to increase with soil perviousness. However, the potential for mitigating the impacts of urbanization through runoff reduction is also greater for pervious, sandy soils that dominate central and south Florida. A greater potential for urbanization mitigation in Florida’s highly pervious soils initiates more research in quantifying the benefits of LID. Southwest Florida is currently in its infancy when adopting LID on a broad-scale; however, several municipalities {{are in the process}} of incorporating LID into their stormwater management programs. Low Impact Development includes non-structural practices such as minimal site disturbance and maintenance of natural flow patterns as well as structural practices. There are numerous structural LID practices such as rain barrels, bioretention systems, infiltration trenches, green roofs, and pervious pavement. Structural LIDs can be divided into comparison categories such as low capital cost and high capital cost as well as rainwater harvesting and infiltration- based. Low capital cost options include rain gardens, which can range from $ 4. 00 to $ 10. 00 per cubic foot of runoff volume whereas high capital cost options include pervious pavements and green roofs, which can range from $ 120. 00 and $ 225. 00 - $ 360. 00 per cubic foot of runoff volume, respectively. Given the order of magnitude difference in cost between the low capital cost and the high capital cost LIDs, the focus of this thesis will be on those practices which require a low initial capital investment. Additionally, the low-cost options are further divided into two categories, rainwater harvesting LIDs and infiltration-based LIDs. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a LID practice that attenuates peak flow during wet weather events and reduces potable water demand for uses that would not normally require water of potable quality. The two options for RWH are rain barrels and cisterns. The difference between the two is a matter of scale. Rain barrels are typically implemented in one or more barrels with a volume of approximately 55 -gallons, where as cistern volumes start at the hundreds of gallons. Effective RWH design includes long-term supply and demand as well as physical site considerations. Southwest Florida’s climate pattern is not compatible with rain barrels for runoff reduction due to their small volume; however, they still offer modest potable water savings to homeowners. Given the type, duration, and frequency of storm events, cisterns can offer runoff reduction as well as reducing potable water demand. For example, in Tampa, Florida, to achieve approximately 70 % catchment efficiency, an average sized home would need approximately fourteen 55 -gallon rain barrels or a 750 -gallon cistern. Conversely, for a single 50 -gallon rain barrel that serves outdoor use only, the water-saving efficiency is about 10 % for Tampa. When properly designed, infiltration-based LIDs mitigate groundwater disruptions that result from urbanization such as minimizing receiving water body hydromodifications, such as stream bank erosion, and reducing pollutant discharges to surface waters. Infiltration-based LIDs include systems such as bioretention, level spreaders, <b>drywells,</b> and “pocket” practices i. e. pocket wetlands. Infiltration-based LIDs may be wet or dry systems and rely on easily attainable construction materials such as gravel, sand, and native vegetation. This combination may have applicability in Florida due to flat slopes, sandy soils, and areas with occasionally high seasonal water table. National standards for LID design should be considered guidelines and adapted accordingly to regional conditions in Southwest Florida. It is possible to utilize any number of LIDs, though one of the key factors to success is proper knowledge of the seasonally high water table, especially along the coast line. Additional factors to ensure infiltration-based LID success include installing a pre-treatment filter strip, standardized infiltration rate testing, standardized materials specifications, proper sequence of construction, and diligent construction inspections during and following construction. The prospect of increased LID implementation within Southwest Florida appears promising. Municipalities are actively incorporating LID into their stormwater management recommendations. A behavioral study and interviews with staff from local governments regarding LID was conducted. The results indicate that Southwest Florida is facing many of the same barriers to implementation as other communities across the nation. These include lack of knowledge and education, lack of regionally specific design guidelines, and few “real world” pilot projects. Based on the behavioral study, it appears education could be the strongest key to LID acceptance. Over the course of three months in a graduate level urban hydrology course, opinions regarding LID in Southwest Florida went from not possible to positively inquiring how to increase implementation. Since the region faces most of the same barriers to implementation, it may be possible to use other cities’ methods to increase LID acceptance and implementation as a template while modifying them so they are regionally appropriate. A mnemonic device entitled “Let’s Make LIDs RADD” was created to assist engineers in implementing successful LIDs. Where “R” represents site reconnaissance, “A” stands for choosing the appropriate LID given the site conditions, the first “D” denotes conducting a drainage investigation, and the second “D” corresponds with finalizing the LID design based on the information gathered after conducting all previous acronym activities...|$|R
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} such a break (call it time T+0) would be a pressurized stream of water well above the boiling point shooting out of the broken pipe into the <b>drywell,</b> which is at atmospheric pressure. As this water stream flashes into steam, due to the decrease in pressure {{and that it is}} above the water boiling point at normal atmospheric pressure, the pressure sensors within the <b>drywell</b> will report a pressure increase anomaly within it to the reactor protection system at latest T+0.3. The RPS will interpret this pressure increase signal, correctly, as the sign of a break in a pipe within the <b>drywell.</b> As a result, the RPS immediately initiates a full SCRAM, closes the main steam isolation valve (isolating the containment building), trips the turbines, attempts to begin the spinup of RCIC and HPCI, using residual steam, and starts the diesel pumps for LPCI and CS.|$|E

However, a <b>drywell</b> placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an infiltration basin defeating its purpose. Depression-focused recharge of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.|$|E
