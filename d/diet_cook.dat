Statistical analysis of the results included descriptive statistical parameters: mean (M), standard deviation (SD), and variation coefficient (CV%). In order to test the statistical significance of the differences between treatments a multifactor variance test (ANOVA) was performed for ROM, MDA and FRAP and the combined effects of diet, exercise and time period were observed. The initial (in June) increase in MDA and ROMs after exercise indicates the presence of oxidative stress 30 minutes after exercise. However, the antioxidative effects of rose-hip and grapeseed extracts are not conclusive, as multifactor ANOVA testing of time, diet, and exercise factors did not reveal for MDA statistically significant differences either at 60 days of supplementation nor 60 days after withdrawal of the supplements.

RESULTS: The analysis of the content of the interviews and of the field observation data was organized into two categories: nutritional aspects separate from those of the food in which a valorization of the nutritional aspect was noted, principally in nutritional support actions, in detriment of the sensory and symbolic aspects of the hospital food; and the hospital diet in which a lack of technical information about available hospital diets was observed; the actual hospitalization, as referring to the conditions of control and discipline and the limited autonomy and right to speak of the patients, were reflected in their social representation.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to investigate the effects of feeding a cereal grain containing NSP on body growth and the intestinal microenvironment of recently weaned pigs, and to examine resultant associations with pathogenic Escherichia coli in the intestinal tract. In Expt 1, pearl barley, a grain rich in soluble NSP, was incorporated (250, 500 or 750 g/kg diet) into a low-fibre control <b>diet</b> based on <b>cooked</b> white rice and fed for 7 - 10 d following weaning. Consumption of pearl barley did not significantly alter piglet live-weight gain compared with the control <b>cooked</b> rice <b>diet,</b> but it accelerated large intestinal growth and fermentation, decreased ileal starch digestibility and increased intestinal viscosity. Expt 2 was conducted to determine whether these differences would favour proliferation of enterotoxigenic E. coli, the bacterium causing post-weaning colibacillosis (PWC). Three groups of pigs were weaned onto <b>diets</b> based on <b>cooked</b> white rice, rice with 500 g pearl barley/kg, or rice with 500 g pearl barley/kg supplemented with exogenous enzymes (Porzyme™ 8100; Danisco, Marlborough, Wilts., UK). Pigs were inoculated orally with haemolytic E. coli serovar O 8;K 87;K 88 after weaning. Animals eating the pearl barley had increased viscosity of the intestinal contents, greater intestinal colonisation with the E. coli strain and more diarrhoea than pigs fed the rice-only diet. The enzymes did not reduce viscosity or protect from PWC. The results suggest that pearl barley alters the intestinal microenvironment and predisposes to PWC, whilst a low-viscosity, highly digestible <b>diet</b> based on <b>cooked</b> white rice is protective...|$|R

Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed high fat diet (HFD) for six weeks to induce glucose intolerance, followed by four weeks of feeding PSC-supplemented <b>diets.</b> <b>Cooked</b> PSC improved glucose tolerance by approximately 30 % (p < 0. 05), and raw and <b>cooked</b> PSC <b>diets</b> reduced insulin response by 53 % and 56 % respectively (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01), compared to HFD (containing cellulose {{as the source of}} dietary fiber). 16 S rRNA gene sequencing on fecal samples showed a significant shift in the overall microbial composition of PSC groups when compared to HFD and low fat diet (LFD) controls. At the family level, PSC increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae (p < 0. 001), and decreased Porphyromonadaceae (p < 0. 01) compared with HFD. This was accompanied by increased mRNA expression of mucin genes Muc 1, Muc 2, and Muc 4 in ileal epithelium (p < 0. 05). Serum levels of acetate and propionate increased with raw PSC diet (p < 0. 01).

Species such as Homo ergaster existed with large brain volumes during time periods with little to no evidence of fire for cooking. Little variation exists in the brain sizes of Homo erectus dated from periods of weak and strong evidence for cooking. In Cornélio’s experiments involving mice fed raw versus cooked meat, the results found that cooking meat did not increase the amount of calories taken up by mice, leading to the study’s conclusion that the energetic gain is the same, if not greater, in raw meat <b>diets</b> than <b>cooked</b> meats. Studies such as this and others lead criticisms of {{the hypothesis}} to state that the increases in human brain-size occurred well before the advent of cooking due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat. Other anthropologists argue that the evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only 250,000 BP, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burned animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} into the functional link between diet and form have focused on rigorous quantitative methods for describing shape using geometric morphometrics. I used geometric morphometric analysis to investigate primate mandibular shape with respect to four dietary categories: frugivores, folivores, ripe fruit specialists and the cooked food specialist. I used statistical shape analysis to evaluate the contribution of dietary composition and feeding ecology to jaw morphology compared to other factors (e. g. phylogeny). Twenty-eight landmark coordinates on 178 haplorhine mandibles of 9 different taxa were collected using a 3 D Microscribe. Coordinates were superimposed using procrustes analysis and then analyzed using MorphoJ software analysis package. Landmark coordinate values were analyzed using two sets. The first set utilized all 28 landmarks to represent the overall shape of the mandible, whereas the second set used only landmark coordinates found along the corpus and symphysis. Canonical variate analysis (CVA), ANOVA and discriminant function analysis revealed significant variation between frugivores, folivores and cook food specialists with less variation between ripe fruit specialists and frugivores in both data sets. This study not only shows predictable relationships to dietary classifications but also adds to the hypothesis that our bodies are adapted to a <b>diet</b> of <b>cooked</b> food...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Yellow pea is {{a widely}} {{available}} grain legume for poultry diets that contains some anti nutritional factors that has negative effect in animals. For selection the more effective methods to improving the nutritional value of yellow pea various treatment methods were tested. In a completely randomized design, three hundred, 7 -d old male broiler chicks (Arbor Acres) were distributed in six treatments with five replicate of ten birds each. Broiler chicks were fed <b>diets</b> containing <b>cooked,</b> dehulled, autoclaved and whole raw peas {{for a period of}} six weeks. In 1 - 3 wk period daily feed intake (FI) and body weight gain (BWG) were higher (p< 0. 01) for birds fed dehulled and those fed autoclaved peas. In 3 - 6 wk and whole period cooking and autoclaving improved (p< 0. 01) BWG and feed conversion rate (FCR). The autoclaved and <b>cooked</b> peas based <b>diets</b> had better FCR and higher BWG (p< 0. 01). Liver was bigger for birds fed enzyme added and treated peas (p< 0. 01). The relative abdominal fat was higher in processed treatments The results showed that in compared to raw peas cooked,autoclaved dehulled had positive effect on the feeding value of yellow peas for broilers...|$|R
40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is {{a severe}} mucohaemorrhagic colitis resulting from infection with the anaerobic spirochaete Serpulina hyodysenteriae. Interactions with other {{components of the}} large intestinal microflora enhance colonisation by the spirochaete. In a series of experiments we have demonstrated that pigs fed on a low-fibre <b>diet</b> based on <b>cooked</b> white rice and animal protein completely resisted experimental infection. Addition of soluble fibre (guar gum) but not insoluble fibre (oaten chaff) to the rice diet then allowed colonisation by the spirochaetes, {{and the development of}} SD. Examination of other cereal grains and processing methods identified steam-flaked maize and sorghum as ingredients that also reduce susceptibility of pigs to SD. Protective diets are associated with reduced fermentation in the large intestine: this finding offers a new approach to the control of SD...|$|R
