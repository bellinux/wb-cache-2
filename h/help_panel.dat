5000|$|The expansion, titled Fall of Oriath was {{released}} August 4, 2017. The expansion adds 6 new acts {{and is the}} largest expansion released to date. The expansion also will replace cruel and merciless difficulties with Acts VI-X. A a new Character Selection Screen has been added. A <b>help</b> <b>panel</b> has been created for players to use as well. There are also 8 new Vaal side areas with new bosses. There is also a new passive skill tree planning system. There are 3 new skill gems and numerous support gems added as well. 24 new unique items have been added, 5 of them, designed by supporters of the game. [...] The areas of the first five acts are revisited with changes to the environment that {{were the result of}} the players actions. The Pantheon system has also been added, where you can obtain interchangeable buffs from boss gods found in the new content.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} the development a programmable physical toy, designed to teach children, aged ten to twelve, computer programming concepts. As technology and computers play an increasingly large role in our society, the desire to teach young minds programming is growing. How then, do you teach children in a fun, and still pedagogical, way? The work was divided into different phases, {{the first of which}} was a prestudy conducted to research the various ways in which children learn and how to keep them motivated when learning, particularly when learning to program. This prestudy mainly focuses on previous research and studies within this subject. The next phase was the implementation of the product; {{a modified version of the}} graphical programming language Scratch, incorporated into a webpage, and a modified version of the mobile robot GoPiGo. Based on results from two separate case studies involving users of the appropriate age, during the evaluation phase, a <b>help</b> <b>panel</b> was implemented in order to make the platform simple to use and to incorporate the pedagogical aspects of the project. The report describes the phases of this work and the technical details of both the modifications made on the Scratch platform and the GoPiGo robot toy, which have both received a positive response from the target audience. The finished product is a robot on wheels that can successfully be programmed through the platform with a <b>help</b> <b>panel,</b> describing various programming concepts and with optional tasks, designed to motivate the users to learn. The results of the project also include observations and the results of two surveys from the conducted user evaluations...|$|E

50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is based}} around using manga panels that represent characters to create decks on a four by five grid. Panels come in various shapes and sizes, taking up one to eight blocks. There are three kinds of panels that can be initialized in battle: Battle, Support, and <b>Help</b> <b>panels,</b> with decks needing {{at least one of}} each type and an assigned leader before being playable. Battle panels are four to eight block panels that represent playable characters. They are based on various manga panels and are used to represent what kind of special attacks the characters have. Support panels are two or three block panels that represent non-playable characters that can perform actions such as attacks, healing or status effects. <b>Help</b> <b>panels</b> are one block panels that can give different boosts to characters they are placed next to. Each battle panel comes with a certain nature. These natures (Knowledge, Strength, and Laughter) act in a Rock, Paper, Scissors relationship with Strength beating Knowledge, Knowledge beating Laughter, and Laughter beating Strength. The stronger type will deal more damage to the weaker type. New panels can be unlocked by clearing challenges in Story mode, or evolving existing panels using gems collected in Story Mode to unlock new paths and panels, such as stronger variations of Battle pannels.|$|R
