40|$|China's recent {{emergence}} as a leading global economic and financial powerhouse has implications for all aspects of global governance. While {{a growing body of}} literature has analysed the consequences for international trade arrangements, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), fewer studies have focused on the cluster of institutions that oversee financial regulatory standard-setting and policy development at the global level, referred to here as the <b>global</b> financial <b>regulatory</b> system. In spite of significant crisis-induced changes in the last decade, this system has not sufficiently adapted to the new reality of China's prominence, and has remained unsustainably centred on incumbent North Atlantic financial systems. This lagging pattern is in the interest neither of the incumbents, nor of China, nor of the world as a whole. In order to move towards a better institutional balance, <b>global</b> financial <b>regulatory</b> bodies should increase the presence and prominence of Chinese participants in their governance and operations.

40|$|Two major {{shifts in}} the <b>global</b> {{financial}} <b>regulatory</b> landscape are likely impeding harmonization of global financial regulation: financial multipolarity, meaning the rise of emerging-market economies such as China {{and the impact of}} this trend on decision-making at the global level, and financial reregulation, or the trend toward stronger regulation of financial systems to buttress financial stability, particularly in developed economies. As a result, the ambitious objectives initially set by the G- 20 leaders {{in the wake of the}} unprecedented financial crisis have so far not resulted in major international breakthroughs, warranting a reconsideration of the <b>global</b> financial <b>regulatory</b> agenda. Consistent regulatory choices across the globe are preferable, but achieving consistency involves difficult political and economic tradeoffs. Continued global capital-market integration can no longer be taken for granted. Policymakers should prioritize four key components to ensure the sustainability of financial integration: (1) strong global public institutions to provide a comprehensive analytical picture, set authoritative standards, and foster and monitor the consistency of regulatory practice; (2) globally consistent financial information; (3) new arrangements to enable and supervise globally integrated capital-market infrastructure; and (4) creating a level playing field for global capital-market intermediaries by addressing competitive distortions. ...|$|R
