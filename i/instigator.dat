5|$|Although {{the death}} of Apokaukos did not bring about the {{immediate}} collapse of the regency, it removed the main <b>instigator</b> {{of the civil war}} and one of its chief protagonists, and resulted in dissension and defections in the regency's camp. It therefore {{marked the beginning of the}} war's end, which would come with Kantakouzenos's entry into Constantinople on 3 February 1347.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an <b>instigator</b> penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
40|$|Driver {{aggression}} {{is an increasing}} concern for motorists, with some research suggesting that drivers who behave aggressively perceive their actions as justified by the poor driving of others. Thus attributions may {{play an important role}} in understanding driver aggression. A convenience sample of 193 drivers (aged 17 - 36) randomly assigned to two separate roles (‘perpetrators’ and ‘victims’) responded to eight scenarios of driver aggression. Drivers also completed the Aggression Questionnaire and Driving Anger Scale. Consistent with the actor-observer bias, ‘victims’ (or recipients) in this study were significantly more likely than ‘perpetrators’ (or <b>instigators)</b> to endorse inadequacies in the <b>instigator’s</b> driving skills as the cause of driver aggression. <b>Instigators</b> were significantly more likely attribute the depicted behaviours to external but temporary causes (lapses in judgement or errors) rather than stable causes. This suggests that <b>instigators</b> recognised drivers as responsible for driving aggressively but downplayed this somewhat in comparison to ‘victims’/recipients. Recipients and <b>instigators</b> agreed that the behaviours were examples of aggressive driving but <b>instigators</b> appeared to focus on the degree of intentionality of the driver in making their assessments while recipients appeared to focus on the safety implications. Contrary to expectations, <b>instigators</b> gave mean ratings of the emotional impact of driving aggression on recipients that were higher in all cases than the mean ratings given by the recipients. Drivers appear to perceive aggressive behaviours as modifiable, with the implication that interventions could appeal to drivers’ sense of self-efficacy to suggest strategies for overcoming plausible and modifiable attributions (e. g. lapses in judgement; errors) underpinning behaviours perceived as aggressive...|$|R

5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot {{injury in the}} Broncos Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the <b>instigator</b> of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class. In an ironic twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is the murderer and the man is the <b>instigator.</b> Leskov's novel {{was the basis for}} Dmitri Shostakovich's 1936 opera of the same name.|$|E
40|$|Peer reviewedMuch {{work has}} been carried out in respect of {{religious}} conflict in Nigeria. Most of it focuses on perpetrators of collective violence, and the consequences on the victims, who are generally caught in the web of the pact between the <b>instigators</b> and perpetrators. These two visible parties in the conflict usually receive wide coverage and public attention, no less also from the church. However, little or no space has been devoted to the powerful roles of the <b>instigators</b> in the conflict. Through the gristmill of needs theory, it is argued that the most important cause of religious conflict in Nigeria is the unsatisfied wants of the <b>instigators</b> who use the army of socioeconomically deprived perpetrators to deploy violence. Just as the government has the onerous task to expose and punish the <b>instigators</b> and perpetrators of conflict, so does the church have the right to challenge the government to be alive to its responsibilities...|$|R

The Canadian government has often {{been described as the}} <b>instigator</b> of multicultural ideology, because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>instigator</b> was, again, {{his nephew}} Máel Coluim, who now {{had the support}} of Óengus of Moray. King Óengus was David's most {{powerful}} vassal, a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even had his own claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into Angus, where they were met by David's Mercian constable, Edward; a battle took place at Stracathro near Brechin. According to the Annals of Ulster, 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army – including Óengus himself – died.|$|E
5|$|Tiny Town, in Springfield, Missouri, was {{the first}} city built in {{miniature}} and had over a thousand structures. A smaller village version was completed in 1919, while the larger full version was completed in 1925. It was motivated primarily by a local homebuilding promotion. The project involved 10,000 students from eighteen Springfield public high schools. The superintendent {{of the school system}} was a key <b>instigator</b> of the project and used it as a teaching aid to instruct students in government, home-ownership and citizenship.|$|E

5|$|W. W.

He involved students in the governmental duties associated with the project, which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. Concepts such as women’s suffrage and political ambition came into play. A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees in a political campaign.|$|E
5|$|A {{player who}} commits three major {{penalties}} (including fighting) {{during a game}} is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an <b>instigator</b> of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, {{but in practice}} ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The identities of the perpetrator or the <b>instigator</b> are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the <b>Instigator</b> rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{cancelled}} {{because of a}} labor dispute, but upon the League's return for the 2005–06 season, a rule was added which meant that any player being assessed for an <b>instigator</b> penalty {{in the last five}} minutes of a match would receive an automatic one-game ban, and the player's head coach could also be fined. This was designed to avoid situations such as happened in game between the Flyers and Senators, and addressed the fact that physical play tended to increase towards the end of a game, particularly when the result was not in question.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior <b>instigator.</b> They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day.

5|$|Using his {{profits and}} {{possibly}} the proceeds of tithing paid {{to him as a}} LDS church representative, Brannan bought land from Sutter in the Sacramento area. Around this same time Brannan established ship trade with China, Hawaii, and the east coast. His land holdings extended to southern California and to Hawaii where, in 1851, he visited and purchased large amounts of land in Honolulu. He and other landowners and speculators raised the price of Californian land considerably, angering many. The disagreement escalated during 1850 into the Squatters' Riot, during which the squatter's spokesman, Doctor Charles L. Robinson, was shot, along with others. Nine people were killed. Brannan was considered the <b>instigator</b> of the incident.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial {{movement}} had {{split into two}} parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller tribal groups. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its President, although the government vetoed it, insisting {{that he had been}} an <b>instigator</b> of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta's detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Back in Egypt, as-Sallar {{was assassinated}} in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas's son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, {{according}} to Usama, was Nasr's lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the <b>instigator</b> of this plot. Usama {{may also have been}} behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir's relatives called upon a supporter, Ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of Cairo, and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in Cairo, and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in Cairo, but Usama was able to bring them to Damascus, through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them safely, but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the psychology of}} “instigators,” i. e., people who surround an unethical act and influence the wrongdoer (the “actor”) without directly committing the act themselves. In four studies, we found that <b>instigators</b> of unethical acts underestimated their influence over actors. In Studies 1 and 2, university students enlisted other students to commit a “white lie” (Study 1) or commit a small act of vandalism (Study 2) after making predictions about how easy {{it would be to}} get their fellow students to do so. In Studies 3 and 4, online samples of participants responded to hypothetical vignettes, e. g., about buying children alcohol, and taking office supplies home for personal use. In all 4 studies, <b>instigators</b> failed to recognize the social pressure they levied on actors through simple unethical suggestions, i. e., the discomfort actors would experience by making a decision that was inconsistent with the <b>instigator’s</b> suggestion...|$|R
