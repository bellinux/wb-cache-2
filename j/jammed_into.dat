5|$|The I&R platoon {{members who}} were able to walk were sent to Germany. James was so seriously wounded he couldn't speak. He and Kalil, who was also seriously wounded, were loaded onto trucks and {{eventually}} put aboard trains. Bouck was <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> a single railroad cattle car with 71 others POWs and traveled for days without food or water. By Christmas Day, seven men in Bouck's car had died and the rest were barely hanging on. The prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. McConnell, also wounded, ended up like James in Stalag XI-B near Bad Fallingbostel, the most primitive POW camp in Germany. Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII-D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII-C in Hammelberg, where the non-commissioned and enlisted men were split, with the officers sent to Oflag XIII-B. Hammelberg was designed for 300 prisoners, but it soon housed more than 1500 POWs.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 1946, Senator Roxas {{announced}} his candidacy for President in a convention held in Santa Ana Cabaret in Manila. According to the Manila Chronicle:...more than three thousand (by conservative estimate {{there were only}} 1,000 plus) delegates, party members and hero worshipers <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> suburban, well known Santa Ana Cabaret (biggest in the world) to acclaim ex-katipunero and Bagong Katipunan organizer Manuel Acuña Roxas as the guidon bearer of the Nacionalista Party's Liberal Wing. The delegates, who came {{from all over the}} Islands, met in formal convention from 10:50am and did not break up till about 5:30pm.|$|E
25|$|At about 12:15 am, a flare {{lit up the}} sky and {{the first}} armored {{personnel}} vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30 am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of cement at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum {{on the east side of}} the Square.|$|E

25|$|At the hospital, {{paramedic}} Jimmy (Lance Guest) develops romantic {{feelings for}} Laurie, {{much to the}} chagrin of head nurse Mrs. Alves (Gloria Gifford). Michael discovers Laurie's location via the radio, due to the event reaching the media, and makes his way to the hospital. Once there, he cuts the phone lines, disables the cars, and kills the hospital personnel. Security guard Mr. Garrett goes downstairs to fix the power in the basement and is killed with a hammer claw to his skull. Paramedic Budd is strangled while Nurse Karen is drowned in a hot tub. Orderly Janet hurries off to find Dr. Mixter only to find him dead with a needle <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> his eye. Before she can flee, Michael kills her with a syringe. Jimmy and Nurse Jill Franco (Tawny Moyer) search the hospital for Laurie, who is trying to evade Michael; Jimmy finds Mrs. Alves' corpse and slips {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor, losing consciousness.|$|E
500|$|The agents ask Kobold {{for help}} finding the {{remaining}} perpetrator. When speaking to Kobold, he suddenly {{speaks in a}} strange backward whispering and erupts in convulsions. Reyes hears the word [...] "medicus," [...] meaning [...] "physician." [...] After putting Kobold {{in the custody of}} another guard named Custer, Doggett and Reyes race to Sampson's home and find her dead, with a dozen hypodermic needles <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> her face. During a one-on-one confrontation, Kobold taunts Doggett about his personal life before vomiting all over him. That night, the power suddenly goes out in the mental institution: Custer approaches Kobold's cell and witnesses him turning into a demon.|$|E
500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} 1923 season, Michigan faced the United States Marine Corps {{football}} team from the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia. [...] The game was attended by 2,000 Marines and by several dignitaries, including Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby, who had played football at Michigan in the 1890s, and Marine Corps Commandant John A. Lejeune. [...] Before the game, dedication ceremonies were held for the newly constructed Yost Field House. [...] Speaking to thousands <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> the building for the dedication, University of Michigan President Marion LeRoy Burton said, [...] "May this building, bearing his name, stand through the years as a silent but compelling witness to the worth of loyalty, integrity, and manhood." ...|$|E

50|$|For instance, a fan {{might send}} the phrase “frightened rabbit”, causing the band {{to play a}} frantic, nimble jam. After a period of time, the word “rabbit” might get changed to “brontosaurus” which would take the jam in a heavy, slower direction, though the word “frightened” is still in play. Then perhaps the word “skydiving” morphs the “frightened brontosaurus” <b>jam</b> <b>into</b> a soaring, {{powerful}} piece of music that evokes {{the feeling of being}} airborne. But then the phrase “without a parachute” gets tacked on which changes the <b>jam</b> <b>into</b> something else entirely. And so on. The event also includes one or more Q&A sessions to provide an opportunity to ask about what the fans are witnessing or anything else they would like to ask the band.|$|R
5000|$|In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes wrote, [...] "on this era-epitomizing set, {{recorded}} at the University of Montana, Grateful Dead are on point.

500|$|Bryan set {{the formal}} {{acceptance}} of his nomination for August 12 at New York's Madison Square Garden; he left Lincoln five days earlier by rail, and spoke 38times along the way, sometimes from the trackside in his nightgown. [...] While speaking in McKinley's hometown of Canton, Ohio, Bryan yielded to impulse and called upon his rival {{at his home}} with Congressman Bland; the Republican candidate and his wife, somewhat startled, received the two men hospitably in a scene Williams calls, [...] "surely bizarre." [...] August 12 was an extremely hot day in New York, especially for the crowd <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> the Garden; when Missouri Governor William J. Stone, chair of the notification committee, essayed a lengthy speech, he was {{drowned out by the}} crowd, which wanted to hear [...] "the Boy Orator of the Platte". [...] Many were disappointed; the Democratic candidate read a two-hour speech from a manuscript, wishing to look statesmanlike, and fearing that if he spoke without a script, the press would misrepresent his words. [...] Many seats were vacant before he concluded.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the lower}} price console's {{positioning}} as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega {{had a difficult}} time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. [...] Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. [...] Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was [...] "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system. [...] Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. [...] According to Bayless, [...] "games in the queue were effectively <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. [...] Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. [...] By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of." ...|$|E
500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the {{voice on the other end}} of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E

50|$|In {{the play}} Arcadia by Tom Stoppard, Thomasina Coverly uses {{the example of}} {{stirring}} <b>jam</b> <b>into</b> rice pudding as an illustration of chaos. She wonders why it isn't possible to separate the jam from the pudding by stirring backwards. Her tutor Septimus Hodge asserts that it is because our universe is deterministic, according to the theories of Isaac Newton.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976's Black Market {{album was}} perhaps the most rock-oriented work which the group had {{produced}} to date. Weather Report's music had evolved further from open-ended funk <b>jams</b> <b>into</b> more melody-oriented, concise forms, which also offered a greater mass-market appeal. Zawinul further consolidated his use of keyboard synthesizers, while Shorter experimented with an early form of wind synthesizer, the Lyricon.|$|R
500|$|Pierre Sévigny, {{who would}} be elected an MP in 1958, {{recalled}} the gathering, [...] "When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, I saw people kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after." [...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and {{sitting there in the}} front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E

50|$|Notes: The <b>jam</b> <b>into</b> Timber {{included}} a Slipknot! tease. Bold As Love was played for a fan {{up front with}} a sign requesting it. A humorous scene ensued when another fan got excited, as if Trey was referring to his Brother sign. Trey remarked that when fans bring signs, {{it has to be}} for a song the band wants to play.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars and states [...] "Precision and dynamic create the drama on this set and, {{as it moves}} from one <b>jam</b> <b>into</b> another, a state of deep black and blue grace is achieved, making this a seductive, smoky, from the depths kind of record. This one is {{overlooked}} by critics but the reason why is baffling".|$|R

2500|$|The {{attack on}} Kerrigan {{and the news}} of Harding's alleged {{involvement}} led to a media frenzy. Kerrigan appeared {{on the cover of}} both TIME and Newsweek magazines in January 1994. Reporters and TV news crews attended Harding's practices in Portland and camped out in front of Kerrigan's home. CBS assigned Connie Chung to follow her every move in Lillehammer. Four hundred members of the press <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> the practice rink in Norway.

Louima also initially claimed that the officers involved in the attack called him a racial slur and shouted, [...] "This is Giuliani-time" [...] during the beating. Louima later recanted that claim, and the reversal was used by defense lawyers to cast doubt on the entirety of his testimony.|$|E

Kaiser Hall, which had been dedicated September 18, 1965—but soon the annual graduation ceremonies threatened to outgrow even Kaiser, which was designed to seat 4,500 spectators (not including those on the gym floor). One newspaper report referred to [...] "3,500 people stacked up to 22 rows high," [...] "stewing" [...] in the June heat at the 1967 event; another article the following year describes “the estimated 5,700 <b>jammed</b> <b>into</b> steaming Kaiser Hall for the program.” ...|$|E
