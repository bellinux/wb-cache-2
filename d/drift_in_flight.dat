60|$|The air felt unusually {{heavy and}} oppressive. Felix {{raised his eyes}} to the sky, and saw whisps of light cloud <b>drifting</b> <b>in</b> rapid <b>flight</b> over the {{scudding}} moon. Below, an ominous fog bank gathered steadily westward. Then one clap of thunder rent the sky. After it came a deadly silence. The moon was veiled. All was dark as pitch. The natives themselves fell on their faces and prayed with mute lips. Three minutes later, the cyclone had burst upon them in all its frenzy.|$|R

The relationships between intensity of cloud cover and the frequency and density of migration are illustrated. The aspects of migration which were determined by the radar were: (1) migration under total overcast, (2) compensation for wind <b>drift,</b> (3) changes <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> direction during migration, and (4) effects of meteorological parameters...|$|R
40|$|The weightless {{environment}} onboard spacecraft <b>in</b> <b>drifting</b> <b>flight</b> {{has provided}} {{a unique opportunity to}} do experiments that cannot be done on the ground. High resolution free-fluid electrophoresis of particles proposed in the late 1960 s to take advantage of reduced gravity began with brief experiments done during two Apollo flights. The recent Apollo Soyuz Test Project mission had two major experiments that accomplished the separation of viable biological cells. Experiments now are being planned for the Space Shuttle which will attempt to achieve high resolution of the separated species by using zone electrophoresis. These experiments will return a quantity sufficient for laboratory testing and establish the potential of fractionation and purification of biological materials in space...|$|R
40|$|The etalon {{is shown}} to remain stable to less than 5 -m/sec {{equivalent}} wind over one orbit and less than 100 m/sec over several months in orbit. The thermal stability considerations for the highly stable etalon are discussed, including the passive thermal control used <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> The various physical processes which give rise to <b>drifts</b> <b>in</b> the peak transmission wavelength are quantified, and the kinematic mount used to isolate the etalon from large incremental forces caused by changes in the thermal environment is presented.

40|$|Time-dependent {{drift of}} {{resistance}} and threshold voltage in phase change memory (PCM) devices {{is of concern}} as it leads to data loss. Electrical <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> amorphous chalcogenides has been argued to be either due to electronic or stress relaxation mechanisms. Here we show that <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> amorphized Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 nanowires with exposed surfaces is extremely low in comparison to thin-film devices. However, <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> stressed nanowires embedded under dielectric films is comparable to thin-films. Our results shows that <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> PCM is due to stress relaxation and will help in understanding and controlling <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> PCM devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews some of {{the science}} {{currently}} being undertaken to reduce spray <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> Australia by improving the understanding of droplet generation, transmission and capture processes. Research into the behaviour of adjuvants and nozzle systems is leading {{to the development of}} aircraft onboard systems that are capable of automatically maintaining a nominated droplet size <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> The use of large droplet application techniques and spray drift models is contributing to the generation of lower spray <b>drift</b> profiles <b>in</b> broad-acre agriculture. Recent research is developing models that simulate the downwind trajectory of spray droplets from a hydraulic nozzle. The models are being developed to measure and predict the interaction and capture of droplets by simple and complex canopy surfaces. With good science and training and a broad approach to spray management, the potential for spray drift can be reduced concurrently with optimisation of total pesticide delivery systems...|$|R

The principal advantages of our method are its ease of implementation and wide applicability: {{we were able to}} measure <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> all three dimensions simultaneously without adding much complexity or cost to our microscope and with no special sample preparations.|$|R
