Medikus) are widely cultivated in the Mediterranean area for produce essential oils. In this study, 80 lavandin and 55 lavender essential oil samples from various varieties were analyzed. Firstly, a chemometric treatment of mid-infrared spectra {{was used to}} evaluate the capacity of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) regression to discriminate <b>French</b> lavandin and <b>lavender</b> essential oil (EO) samples and their varieties (Abrial, Fine, Grosso, Maillette, Matherone, Sumian and Super), and secondly, to quantify the main compounds such as linalyl acetate, linalool, eucalyptol and camphor by PLS regression using reference data from gas chromatography. The examination of PLS and PLS-DA regression coefficients allowed the identification of metabolomic markers. The lavender/lavandin EOs and their varieties were very well classified (100 % for lavender/lavandin EOs and between 98 and 100 % for varieties). The calibration models obtained by PLS regression for the determination of the main compound contents revealed good correlation (> 0. 86) between the predicted and reference values. This method can be used to control the authenticity and traceability of lavender/lavandin and their varieties. Finally, mid-infrared and Raman spectroscopy results were compared...|$|R

40|$|Intercropping of {{companion}} plants (CPs) that release distinct volatile compounds with horticultural crops {{has been}} proposed to improve pest management. Although CP extracts or essential oils {{have been reported to}} be efficient in disturbing the settling of insects such as aphids, the effect of using actual CPs remains relatively unknown. Our aim was to screen odorous CP species for their effect on the performance of green peach aphid,Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when released on adjacent pepper plants. Intercropping was tested in growth chambers using potted plants to avoid root interactions and homogenise the abiotic environment of CPs. Our results indicated that eight CP species—rosemary, African marigold, <b>French</b> marigold, geranium, <b>lavender,</b> basil, chives, and pot marigold—affected aphid performance by reducing the reproductive performance and/or settlement of females. Rosemary followed by African and French marigold was associated with the largest reduction in adult female and nymph number. Chemical analyses indicated that rosemary and French marigold emit specific volatiles. In contrast, four CP species (false yellowhead, thyme, savoury, and peppermint) were not associated with a significant change in aphid performance and emitted a lower diversity of volatiles. This screening of CPs under controlled conditions may be considered as a first step towards the identification of volatiles emitted by actual plants that can affect aphid performance and help the choice of CPs to optimise intercropping strategies...|$|R

The centre walk of the garden consisted of a castellated yew hedge with marble statuary along its length. The walk terminated in a nymphaeum, flanked by obelisks of yew and featuring a sculpted group of Jupiter and Thetis. Also in the walled house garden was an aviary with golden pheasants; a floral temple of arches and chains in cast iron; and a circular yew hedge with allegorical marble Italian statues representing the five continents, which were reflected in a great circular marble basin in the centre.

40|$|Portuguese {{lavender}} honeys {{are generated}} from the nectar of Lavandula stoechas, whereas <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> honeys are exclusively derived from Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula latifolia, or hybrids of these two species. In {{the framework of the}} floral origin authentication of such honeys, volatile compounds from L. stoechas, L. angustifolia, and L. angustifolia x latifolia unifloral honeys were investigated. The aromatic profiles of French and Portuguese lavender honey samples showed major qualitative and quantitative differences, but no volatile compound is characteristic of L. stoechas honeys only. As expected, n-hexanal, n-heptanal, phenylacetaldehyde, and n-hexanol, previously proposed to authenticate <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> honeys, were found at concentrations far above the published discrimination thresholds. Coumarin, previously proposed to characterize <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> honeys, emerges here rather as an indicator of the freshness of lavender honey, being mainly released from glycosides during storage. Lastly, L. angustifolia honeys were distinguishable from hybrid-derived samples by their lower phenylacetaldehyde and higher heptanoic acid content. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Two {{essential}} oils, namely Ocimum basilicum L. and Lavandula offi­ci­nalis Chaix, {{were tested}} for their repellency, toxicity and oviposition deterrence against two tetranychid mites, tetranychus urticae (Koch) and Eutetranychus orientalis (Klein). Fifty-seven and forty-seven compounds, comprising about 96. 7 and 95. 4 % of sweet basil and <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> oil, respectively, were positively identified using GC-MS technique. Oil analysis revealed the dominant {{occurrence of the}} oxygenated terpenes in either oils (91. 172 and 64. 317 %), respectively. The essential oil of <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> was more potent for E. orientalis than against T. urticae. The ODI of both oils was ranged between (100 - 80) for both mite species at conc. (2 - 0. 5 %). For both oils, {{a significant reduction in}} the total number of eggs laid by both tetranychid species was recorded at all con­centrations used. A high percentage of E. orientalis mortality was recorded for both materials while oil of sweet basil was more effective than <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> oil in case of T. urticae. The results obtained chemically and biologically may suggest that the dominant occurrence of the oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds (91. 172 % of oil content) in sweet basil were responsible for the toxic effect...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChemometric {{treatments}} of near infrared (NIR) spectra were used firstly to understand data structure by {{principal component analysis}} (PCA), to discriminate, by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression, <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> and lavandin essential oils (EOs) samples (n = 160) and the seven varieties (Abrial, Fine, Grosso, Maillette, Matherone, Sumian and Super) and to quantify the main compounds such as linalyl acetate, linalool, eucalyptol and camphor by PLS regression models. The study was carried out over three crop years (2012 – 2014) to take seasonal variations into account. <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> and lavandin EOs and their varieties were well classified (100 % for lavender/lavandin EOs and between 96 and 100 % for varieties) by PLS-DA regression models.

40|$|A {{case study}} of Polish Melilotus officinalis honey was {{presented}} for the first time. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (after steam distillation, Soxhlet extraction, ultrasonic solvent extraction, and solid phase extraction (SPE)) and targeted high performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-PAD) were applied to determine the characteristic components of honey. While ubiquitous in most honeys, carbohydrates, terpene derivatives, and phenylacetic acid dominated in the Soxhlet extracts (25. 54 %) and {{in the application of}} SPE (13. 04 %). In addition, lumichrome (1. 85 %) was found, and may be considered as a marker of this honey. Due to the presence of these compounds, Polish yellow sweet clover honey is similar to <b>French</b> <b>lavender</b> honeys. The major compounds determined in the methanolic extract were (+) -catechine (39. 7 %) and gallic acid (up to 30 %), which can be regarded as specific chemical markers of the botanical origin of melilot honey.

40|$|Lavender {{essential}} oil is popular as a complementary medicine {{in its own}} right and as an additive to many over the counter complementary medicine and cosmetic products ' Indeed, products derived from the popular garden herb Lavender (Lavandula spp.) have been used for centuries as a therapeutic agent, with the more 'recent ' addition, the {{essential oil}}s derived from these plants, being widely used as an antibacterial in World War I],! The oil is traditionally believed to have sedative, carminative, anti-depressive and anti-inflammatory properties, in addition to its recognised antimicrobial effects. Many of the activities attributed to lavender oil have not, however, been substantiated in the scientific literature. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the majority of research into lavender essential oils has been based on oil derived from English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), with little or no differentiation being made between this and other lavender essential oils. The therapeutic potential of essential oils produced from other varieties, such as L. x intermedia (lavandin), L. stoechas (<b>French</b> <b>lavender)</b> and L. x allardii, have largely been ignored. Although the ethnobotanical uses and major chemical constituents are similar between various lavenders, some differences do occur in both oil composition and in the reported therapeutic uses for different p e c i e s,.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 29, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 61 - 65) In agriculture, improper, excessive or poorly timed irrigation and fertilizer applications can result in increased pollutants in runoff and degraded water quality. Specifically, the cultivation of potted plants requires significant irrigation and fertilizer that leads to high nutrient leaching. In southern California, a large producer of nursery plants, waterways are often subjected to elevated nutrient concentrations, which stress the aquatic ecosystem. In this research, the specific objectives are to determine optimal irrigation and fertilizer application rates for minimizing nutrient concentration from nurseries. Altered irrigation and fertilizer application experiments were implemented and monitored at the San Diego State University's Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve, which contains a newly constructed 0. 1 ha nursery. The study was conducted over a ten months period (November, 2007 to August, 2008). The nursery site was divided into eight plots (each 6 -m wide by 18 -m long), with each plot containing 540 plants consisting of four commonly used landscaping varieties (Box-Leaf Euonymus, New Zealand Flax, Lantana, <b>French</b> <b>Lavender)</b> in southern California. The experimental plots represented combinations of irrigation and fertilization practices with different methods and rates. In all cases, irrigation was fully automated based on soil moisture sensors. Irrigation induced runoff was sampled and analyzed for nutrient concentrations on a monthly basis. The growth rate, leaf nutrient content and plant yield were monitored monthly. To assess {{the effectiveness of the}} altered irrigation and fertilizer strategies, runoff water quality and plant yield were compared to control treatments. Drip irrigation system achieved more plant production (9 %) against overhead irrigation while saving water by 23 - 64 %. The plant quality was maintained under drip reduced fertilized plots. Nutrient export from drip system was lowered down by 5 - 35 %. Considering installation and maintenance cost of emitters and pipes, the overhead system is found preferable. In overhead system, plant quality was maintained in reduce fertilized plots and saved water usage by 37 - 48 %. If the treatments are accepted in market, southern California nursery growers will be economically benefited and nearby waterways quality and aquatic life will be improved...|$|E
40|$|Tese de dout., Química, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2012 Erasmus Mundus 2008 - 1022 / 002 Several {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with different Portuguese honey samples from South area (Algarve) in view of exploiting its properties and increasing the commercial value of some types of honey. Initially, the effects of honey storage for long periods were evaluated in terms of physicochemical parameters and bioactivity (Chapter 3) and {{it was concluded that}} after three years most of the properties of honey remained unchanged except for the freshness indicators, which were, as expected, reasonably far from the regulated values. Several commercial samples of honey with different floral origins were subjected to the conventional studies, including melissopalynology pollen analysis, physiochemical and biological (antioxidant properties) analysis. Honey from strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), a typical plant in Algarve, was the focus of this study. This kind of honey has low acceptability by consumers probably because of unawareness of its existence and/or of its beneficial biological properties. Also, it may not be an obvious preference, due to its exquisite bitter taste, thus being locally called “bitter honey” (Chapter 4). Artisanal bitter honey was compared with other commercial honeys that are appreciated by Portuguese consumers (Chapter 5). This research consisted {{in the study of the}} physicochemical parameters, bioactive compounds and sensorial evaluation; done in comparison with sunflower (Helianthus annuus) honey, <b>french</b> <b>lavender</b> (Lavandula stoechas) honey, orange blossom (Citrus spp.) honey and commercial strawberry tree honey. Finally, in the last stage of the work (Chapter 6), new methods for determination of botanical origin of honey were explored as potential alternatives to the traditional analysis method (melissopalynological). These non-invasive techniques namely electronic tongue, UV-Vis spectroscopy and Vis-NIR spectroscopy, were used with the help of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA), for the interpretation of data’s obtained with above techniques. It is hoped that this research will represent an enrichment of knowledge on honey from the Algarve and, especially for Arbutus unedo honey, it has been demonstrated that it has the characteristics of similar gourmet honey from Italy existing, therefore, the potential of increasing its commercial value, which would also be advantageous for the interior region of the Algarve where, since the Arab occupation, the strawberry tree is abundant...|$|E
