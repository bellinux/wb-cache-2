5|$|Halo: Reach is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Bungie {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360 home video game console. The sixth installment in the Halo series, Reach was released worldwide in September 2010. The game {{takes place in the}} year 2552, where humanity <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in a war with the alien Covenant. Players control Noble Six, a member of an elite supersoldier squad, when the human world known as Reach falls under Covenant attack.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders of Sky Scrapper board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in place. After the train is fully locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position and depart the station.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lock</b> files <b>are</b> often named with a tilde (...) prefixed to {{the name}} of the file they <b>are</b> <b>locking.</b> If they <b>are</b> <b>locking</b> a {{resource}} other than a file, they may be named more arbitrarily.|$|R

5|$|The Morris {{family and}} their friend become lost, accidentally finding the HorrorLand theme park. Shortly after parking, their car explodes, but the ticket-taker reassures them {{that it will be}} taken care of. The children, Lizzy Morris, Luke Morris, and their friend Clay, explore the theme park and get on the rides. After a ride in which Lizzy <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in a casket {{traveling}} down a river, the three of them attempt to convince the parents that they all should leave. The parents reveal that they experienced similar problems, so they all decide to confront the Horrors.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a delusional man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{information}} from Black, Mulder concentrates {{on trying to}} find Johnson, when Scully is attacked in the morgue by the dead deputy; Johnson saves her by shooting the deputy, before disappearing. The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late. Mulder breaks into Johnson's house but <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> by Johnson in his basement, where he is attacked by the four corpses of the FBI agents; he manages to shoot and kill one of them. Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun runs out of bullets and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|Hermes {{agrees to}} help Bender {{in his quest}} to {{discover}} the identity of Inspector No. 5, which <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in the Central Bureaucracy. While at the Central Bureaucracy, Hermes logs into the computer system with his ID to look up Inspector No. 5's records. However, he and Bender find that the electronic record on Inspector No. 5 has been deleted and that the physical file is also missing. Bender calls Mom's Friendly Robot Company, who created him, and tells her he is defective. Mom attempts to have Bender destroyed {{to cover up the}} existence of a defective robot. The two flee from Mom's Killbots by train and arrive in Tijuana—where Bender was manufactured.|$|E
5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals the tickets Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the lock on the door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up in the locker room where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E

50|$|On April 10, 2008, two Canadian {{secondary}} schools <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> down due to suspected firearm threats. George S. Henry Academy <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> down in Toronto, Ontario at approximately 2:00 p.m. The Emergency Task Force (TPS) were contacted and the lockdown lasted {{for more than}} two hours. New Westminster Secondary School <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> down in New Westminster, British Columbia at approximately 1:40 p.m. The Emergency Response Team (ERT) were called and the school was under lockdown until 4:30 p.m. Due {{to the size of the}} school some students were not able to leave until 7:00 p.m.|$|R
30|$|The IR laser can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the high-finesse IR cavity {{by using}} {{standard}} Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking techniques [83, 84]. Since the other optical modes for intra-cavity cooling in the high-finesse IR cavity are derived via EOMs and AOMs from the fundamental laser mode (see Section  7.2. 3), they also follow any {{changes of the}} cavity resonance frequency. In addition, these higher-order modes can in turn <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavity via PDH locking. We will also use an EOM to generate a mode to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the IR + UV cavity. To this end, each of the modes to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavities will separately be frequency modulated in the MHz range {{to allow for the}} generation of distinct PDH error signals from the light reflected from the cavity.|$|R
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike <b>is</b> <b>locked,</b> it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after {{reporting}} to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E
5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involves}} {{three friends}} who, while {{searching for the}} cure to a new disease, {{come into contact with}} a space-faring federation that <b>is</b> <b>locked</b> in a war with another galactic power. Using advanced technologies and time travel, the group attempts to uncover the cause of the war and to find a cure for their planet. The Super Famicom version was never released outside Japan due to Enix closing its American branch shortly before the game was finished, as well as Nintendo's focus on supporting the then-upcoming Nintendo 64 video game console. However, the game was later remade by Tose for the PlayStation Portable under the title Star Ocean: First Departure, and released in English-speaking regions in North America, Europe, and Australia in October 2008. The game was the start of the entire Star Ocean series, featuring five main games, 3 spin-offs, a remake, a remaster, and a manga.|$|E
