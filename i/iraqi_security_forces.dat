5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission {{to assist the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> {{in conjunction with the}} US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces,</b> eventually numbering more than 12,000. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After {{more than a year}} in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.|$|E

5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} Anbar Province was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b> He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 a {{small number}} of SASR {{personnel}} were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. In late September 2014 an Air Task Group (ATG) and Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornet strike aircraft, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft, the ATG began operations on 1 October. The SOTG is tasked with operations to advise and assist <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Forces,</b> and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April 2015 a 300-strong unit known as Task Group Taji was deployed to Iraq to train the regular <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Forces.</b> Airstrikes were extended to Syria in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E

S. policy makers and Iraqi officials aim to create a unified <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> force; however, the predominately Sunni Arab insurgency has hampered this effort, and many believe that the new <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> agencies will ultimately be composed of mostly Shiite and Kurdish recruits with both communities separately maintaining their own militias...|$|R
5|$|In August 2006, {{the newly}} reorganized unit {{deployed}} to Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom VI. On 26 September 2006, it uncased its colors at Tallil Airbase in Iraq, to provide support services for coalition forces and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> in southern Iraq. They took this responsibility from the 16th Sustainment Brigade, which was rotating out of the theater. Throughout the deployment and into 2007, the brigade's medical staff was rotated into hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq for thirty day tours for each unit. The medical staff, including many of the brigade's field medics, treated American forces injured in fighting around Baghdad. In August 2007, the brigade participated in a large coalition athletic competition hosted by the US Air Force's 407th Air Expeditionary Group at Ali Air Base, Iraq. The brigade took {{second place in the}} competition, in which it competed in various sports against other US military units as well as Australian and Romanian forces.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{as part of}} Operation Okra the Australian Army {{deployed}} a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) {{of approximately}} 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist and advise <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Forces</b> following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The soldiers {{were expected to be}} deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. The majority of the SOTG was reported to be made up of C Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. It began moving into Iraq in early November. The 2nd Commando Regiment was tasked with training the Iraq government's Counter Terrorism Service. Personnel from SOTG have also been involved in co-ordinating airstrikes remotely to assist Iraqi forces engaged in clearance operations. From September 2015, the strength of SOTG rotations were reduced to approximately 80 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E
50|$|The 23 July 2012 Iraq {{attacks were}} {{a series of}} simultaneous, coordinated bombings and shootings that struck the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>force</b> and Shi'ite Muslim communities.

The Islamic State of Iraq claimed {{responsibility}} for the attacks.|$|R
50|$|During {{the whole}} week, Coalition {{aircraft}} had conducted over 250 airstrikes. Apart from U.S. aircraft, British Tornado GR4 and MQ-9 Reaper aircraft, operating from the Royal Air Force's Akrotiri base targeted ISIL positions near Sinjar and Tall Afar. CF-18 Hornet aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force were also reported to having {{contributed to the}} preparatory mission. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Force</b> helicopters provided aerial MedEvac support conducting five casualty evacuations.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces.</b> More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle has been a subject of much public debate with British {{military}} commanders calling it a 'complete disaster'. Militarily, the battle ended indecisively with the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> <b>forces</b> clearing some districts but facing ferocious resistance in others. Although Mahdi Army fighters withdrew from the streets, clashes between <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Forces</b> and militia continued.|$|E
