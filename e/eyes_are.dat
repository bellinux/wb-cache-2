5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> immobile.|$|E

50|$|The non-{{dominant}} <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{covered and}} the dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> opened and kept open by a speculum, the corneal flap is lifted and the laser correction is done - an ultra thin flap {{can be created}} for treatment of very high prescriptions. The flap is replaced and the speculum is removed. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> treated next. The software data for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> stored in the Carl Zeiss Meditc MEL 80 laser and delivered by the eye-tracker controlled computer generated excimer laser pulses. The laser time for each <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> usually under 30 seconds. The dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> mainly corrected for distance and intermediate vision and the non-dominant <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> corrected for intermediate and near vision, by increasing the depth of focus for each eye.|$|R
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one eye affects {{the diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, the pupil of the first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R
50|$|His right <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{blue and}} his left <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> green, a {{congenital}} condition known as heterochromia.|$|R

5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5000|$|She has heterochromia, a {{condition}} that causes the irises of both <b>eyes</b> to <b>be</b> different colors. In Eve's case, her left <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> blue, and her right <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> green.|$|R

5|$|Oobi (performed by Tim Lagasse) is curious, inquisitive, {{and always}} willing to learn {{something}} new. His <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> brown in the short episodes and hazel in the full-length episodes.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger {{than most other}} shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> circular, with nictitating membranes.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in the primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
60|$|Now, as ever, he {{felt the}} <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> on the spy-hole. There sat the woman playing music. But her inward <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> on the spy-hole of her vital affairs--her {{domestic}} arrangements, her control of her household, guests and husband included. The other <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> left for the music, don't you know.|$|R
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, and the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> well separated {{on the sides}} of the head.|$|E
5|$|From the front, the {{antennae}} and antennules are visible. Beside these {{there are}} the orbits in which the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> situated. The mouthparts comprise three pairs of maxillipeds, behind which there are a pair of maxillae, a pair of maxillules, and finally the mandibles.|$|E
5|$|Monument 65 is a {{badly damaged}} {{depiction}} of a human head in Olmec style, dating to the Middle Preclassic. Its <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed and the mouth and nose are completely destroyed. It is wearing a helmet. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure12.|$|E

5|$|Slender and firm-bodied, the quagga {{catshark}} has a {{short and}} flattened {{head with a}} pointed snout. The slightly protruding {{tip of the snout}} is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin. The small, horizontally oval <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> placed high on the head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes; below the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> thick ridges, and behind them are tiny spiracles. The rather large mouth is curved, with the upper teeth exposed when closed. There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth. The jaws contain 26â€“28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are three tooth rows at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and one row at the lower. The teeth have three cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest.|$|E
5|$|Some scenes shows Timberlake {{performing}} on the stairway with a microphone while {{a group of}} unknown girls with red paint on their <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> seen dancing next to him while one (Johansson) is seen waving her batons with fire on them {{near the end of}} the video.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{differ in}} form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found {{along the bottom of}} the arms, and the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> more developed.|$|E

5000|$|One {{might expect}} the inputs from each eye to simply add together, {{and that the}} {{perceived}} brightness with two <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> twice that of a single eye. However, the perceived brightness with two <b>eyes</b> <b>is</b> only slightly higher compared to a single eye. If one eye sees a bright scene, the perceived brightness will actually decrease if the other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> presented with a dim light. This counterintuitive phenomenon is known as Fechner's Paradox. Several different models have been proposed {{to explain how the}} inputs from each <b>eye</b> <b>are</b> combined.|$|R
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> small and mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth {{are typical of}} an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> placed forward on the head, though not {{so that there is}} extensive binocular vision. Behind the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower teeth are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower teeth are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
50|$|Analyze the {{simulation}} results and decide whether any re-design is required. To analyze the results quite often a data <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> generated and a timing budget is calculated. An example video for generating a data <b>eye</b> can <b>be</b> found on YouTube: An <b>Eye</b> <b>is</b> Born.|$|R
