6000|$|Understanding the process, <b>I</b> <b>grinned</b> at this, and fancied, though I {{could not}} be certain, that Aline's fair {{companion}} envied her the opportunity for giving Harry lessons on anything.

Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb's own unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb {{goes to bed}} upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! <b>I</b> <b>grin</b> at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!" ...|$|R
60|$|You see how <b>I</b> <b>grin</b> sometimes. <b>I</b> can't help that. But I {{can put it}} on a lot. I'm not bad, though. I look {{at myself}} in the glass. My mouth is funny, I know that, and it lops down, and my teeth are bad. You can tell a feeb {{anywhere}} by looking at his mouth and teeth. But that doesn't prove I'm a feeb. It's just because I'm lucky that I look like one.|$|R
60|$|Why the deuce should Mrs. Botibol blow me a kiss? I wouldn't {{kiss her}} for the world. Why do <b>I</b> <b>grin</b> when <b>I</b> see her, as if I was delighted? Am I? I don't care a straw for Mrs. Botibol. I know what she thinks about me. I know what she said about my last volume of poems (I had it from a dear mutual friend). Why, I say in a word, are we going on ogling and {{telegraphing}} each other in this insane way?--Because we are both performing the ceremonies demanded by the Great Snob Society; whose dictates we all of us obey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we have {{present a}} genuine legal mind," [...] said Mr. Scherer, in the playful manner he had adopted of late, while <b>I</b> <b>grinned</b> appreciatively {{and took a}} chair. Mr. Watling {{presently}} suggested kidnapping the Ribblevale treasurer until he should promise to produce the books {{as the only way}} out of what seemed an impasse. But Mr. Scherer brought down a huge fist on his knee.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>grinned</b> at {{her from}} the {{doorstep}} while Mrs. Meldrum's maid stood there to admit me. [...] "Oh I'm so glad," [...] I said, looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when, while she rejoined Lord Iffield, I had indulged in the same observation. Her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that; but I recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom. Was she really now marching away from it? ...|$|E
6000|$|And then Delia's manner {{began to}} change towards me. The ease of our {{intercourse}} vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. <b>I</b> <b>grinned,</b> and capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and knew--with what a voiceless agony!--that I did it all the time. I tried to resign again, and Barnaby talked about [...] "X" [...] and [...] "Z" [...] and [...] "Y" [...] in the New Review, {{and gave me a}} strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me. And then I walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to meet Delia, and so precipitated the crisis.|$|E

6000|$|I {{must have}} looked queer to my friend as <b>I</b> <b>grinned</b> to myself over this vow; but my relish of the way I was keeping things {{together}} made me perhaps for the instant unduly rash. I cautioned myself, however, fortunately, before it could leave her--scared a little, all the same, even with Long behind her--an advantage to take, and, in infinitely less time than I have needed to tell it, I had achieved my flight into luminous ether and, alighting gracefully on my feet, reported myself at my post. I had in other words taken in both the full prodigy of the entente between Mrs. Server's lover and poor Briss's wife, and the finer strength it gave the last-named as the representative of their interest. I may add too that I had even taken time fairly not to decide which of these two branches of my vision--that {{of the terms of}} their intercourse, or that of their need of it--was likely to prove, in delectable retrospect, the more exquisite. All this, I admit, was a good deal to have come and gone while my privilege trembled, in its very essence, in the scale. Mrs. Briss had but a back to turn, and everything was over. She had, in strictness, already uttered what saved her honour, and her revenge on impertinence might easily be her withdrawing with one of her sweeps. I couldn't certainly in that case hurry after her without spilling my cards. As my accumulations of lucidity, however, were now such as to defy all leakage, I promptly recognised the facilities involved in a superficial sacrifice; and with one more glance at the beautiful fact that she knew the strength of Long's hand, I again went steadily and straight. She was acting not only for herself, and since she had another also to serve and, as I was sure, report to, I should sufficiently hold her. I knew moreover that I held her as soon as I had begun afresh. [...] "I don't mean that anything alters the fact that you lose gracefully. It is awfully charming, your thus giving yourself up, and yet, justified as I am by it, I can't help regretting a little the excitement I found it this morning to pull a different way from you. Shall I tell you," [...] it suddenly came to me to put to her, [...] "what, for some reason, a man feels aware of?" [...] And then as, guarded, still uneasy, she would commit herself to no permission: [...] "That pulling against you also had its thrill. You defended your cause. Oh," [...] I quickly added, [...] "I know--who should know better?--that it was bad. Only--what shall I say?--you weren't bad, and one had to fight. And then there was what one was fighting for! Well, you're not bad now, either; so that you may ask me, of course, what more I want." [...] I tried to think a moment. [...] "It isn't that, thrown back on the comparative dullness of security, I find--as people have been known to--my own cause less good: no, it isn't that." [...] After which I had my illumination. [...] "I'll tell you what it is: it's the come-down of ceasing to work with you!" ...|$|E
40|$|I FIND IT HARD {{to grasp}} that it’s been fifty {{years since the}} {{publication}} of Atlas Shrugged. I remember that period so vividly, {{as if it had been}} filmed and I were watching the scenes unroll on a screen before me. They are in black and white, with one exception: in the window of the Random House offices, facing Madison Avenue, I see the bright paint-box colors of the jacket of Atlas, designed by Ayn Rand’s husband, Frank O’Connor. And I see the broad, excited smile on Ayn’s face as she looked at it, with the look of youth and expectation that so rarely transformed the tense gravity of her expression. It was October 1957, several days before the official publication date. That evening, I went with Ayn, Frank, and my husband, Nathaniel, to see if the book was displayed in the Random House window. It was the first time we had seen the book outside of our own small, private world of Ayn’s apartment, the first time it had been out in the wider world where it belonged. <b>I</b> <b>grinned</b> from ear to ear, and quite involuntarily pointed at the book and blurted excitedly, “That’s us!” I realized later that my remark could have been interpreted as presumption, but Ayn understood my meaning. She laughed delightedly, and said, “Yes, it is us! ” I—and in the years that followed—she often referred to that remark with pleasure. It was a memorable evening that, and had been preceded by an even more memorable evening: the time a few months earlier that Ayn had emerged from her study carrying an enormous manuscript, beaming happily, and showed us the words on the final page: The End. “One word leads to another, ” she said. We could not have known then that those two evenings were among the last cloudlessly happy evenings we ever would spen...|$|E

60|$|That is {{a genuine}} memory. But every family, I suppose, has its little pet traditions; and one of ours, {{relating}} to those early years, is connected with our kitchen cat, Miaou. She had come by a family of kittens, and I had crept, so it was said, into her shallow basket with them. Having, I suppose, been too frequently meddled with, this old mother cat lugged off her kittens one by one to a dark cupboard. The last one thus secured, she was discovered in rapt contemplation of myself, as if in debate {{whether or not it}} was her maternal duty to carry me off too. And there was <b>I</b> <b>grinning</b> up into her face. Such was our cook's--Mrs Ballard's--story. What I actually remember is different. On the morning in question I was turning the corner of the brick-floored, dusky passage that led to the kitchen, when Miaou came trotting along out of it with her blind, blunt-headed bundle in her mouth. We were equally surprised at this encounter, and in brushing past she nearly knocked me over where I stood, casting me at the same moment the queerest animal look out of her eyes. So truth, in this case, was not so strange as Mrs Ballard's fiction.|$|R
