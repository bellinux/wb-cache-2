5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the <b>document</b> <b>and</b> their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the <b>document,</b> <b>and</b> that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary <b>document</b> <b>and</b> found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of the coup attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this <b>document,</b> <b>and</b> the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word <b>document</b> <b>and</b> 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official <b>document)</b> <b>and</b> {{the fact that it is}} ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the <b>document</b> <b>and</b> that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to <b>document</b> <b>and</b> recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|Four {{months after}} the birth of the child and just days before {{deployment}} to Iraq, Brown was served with notice of the proposed adoption.

5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This <b>document</b> <b>and</b> the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, Lithuanian {{businessman}} Darius Mockus {{offered a}} 1-million-Euro reward {{to anyone who}} could find the original <b>document</b> <b>and</b> {{give it to the}} State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence. On 29 March 2017, Vytautas Magnus University professor Liudas Mažylis announced he had found the original document in the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive in Berlin, Germany, hand-written in the Lithuanian language and signed by the twenty. He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 <b>document</b> <b>and</b> the Act of 11 December 1917. The latter displays nineteen signatures (without that of Pranas Dovydaitis). Germany confirmed the documents' authenticity on the following day and they were displayed publicly by two officials — Michael Roth, the German Minister of State for Europe, and Deividas Matulionis, Lithuania ambassador in Germany. On October 5, 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevičius and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel signed an agreement that the original Act of Independence will be displayed for five years in the House of the Signatories where it was originally signed, making it the main symbol of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State celebrations.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this <b>document,</b> <b>and</b> reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E

There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 <b>document</b> <b>and</b> was later called ‘dominus de Papay’.
