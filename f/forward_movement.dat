5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.|$|E

5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted.

5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies in his path.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (<b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
40|$|Based on psychophysical {{evidence}} about how learning of visuomotor transformation generalizes, {{it has been}} suggested that movements are planned on the basis of movement direction and magnitude, i. e., the vector connecting movement origin and targets. This notion is also known under the term “vectorial planning hypothesis”. Previous psychophysical studies, however, have included separate areas of the workspace for training movements and testing the learning. This study eliminates this confounding factor by investigating the transfer of learning from <b>forward</b> to backward <b>movements</b> in a center-out-and-back task, in which the workspace for both movements is completely identical. Visual feedback allowed for learning only during movements towards the target (<b>forward</b> <b>movements)</b> and not while moving back to the origin (backward movements). When subjects learned the visuomotor rotation in <b>forward</b> <b>movements,</b> initial directional errors in backward movements also decreased to some degree. This learning effect in backward movements occurred predominantly when backward movements featured the same movement directions as the ones trained in <b>forward</b> <b>movements</b> (i. e., when opposite targets were presented). This suggests that learning was transferred in a direction specific way, supporting the notion that movement direction is the most prominent parameter used for motor planning...|$|R

5|$|On September 1, the {{hurricane}} began to rapidly deepen over warm {{waters of the}} Caribbean Sea; by 1800 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), it had strengthened to Category 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day. Early on September 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen's <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift. Later on September 2, {{the hurricane}} made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm's center passed {{a few miles north}} of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and <b>forward</b> <b>movement.</b> Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 29, 1998 and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America a low-level circulation developed on October 13, about 170miles (275km) south of the border between El Salvador and Guatemala. The system drifted northwestward, and as convection increased around the center a banding featured began to develop. At 0000UTC on October 15, the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The depression contained a large envelope of convective activity, and under favorable conditions including warm water, low vertical wind shear and good outflow, it gradually began to intensify. Initially, the exact direction of <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> was somewhat uncertain, although a northwestward track was predicted. On the morning of October 15, visible satellite imagery suggested that the center of circulation was located northeast of the previous estimates. Thunderstorm activity organized close to the center by 1400UTC, and by 1800UTC the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester.|$|E

5|$|French successes continued. With Charles {{absent from}} the north, Jourdan recrossed the Rhine and drove Wartensleben behind the Lahn. Pushing forward again, the Army of Sambre and Meuse {{defeated}} its opponents in the Battle of Friedberg (also called the First Battle of Limburg) on 10 July, while Charles was busy at Ettlingen. In this action, the Austrians suffered 1,000 casualties against a French loss of 700. Jourdan captured Frankfurt am Main on 16 July. Leaving behind François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers with 28,000 troops to blockade Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein, Jourdan pressed up the Main River. Following Carnot's strategy, the French commander continually operated against Wartensleben's north flank, causing the Austrian general to fall back. Jourdan's army numbered 46,197 men while Wartensleben counted 36,284 troops; Wartensleben felt no security in attacking the larger French force. Buoyed up by their <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> and by the capture of Austrian supplies, the French captured Würzburg on 4 August. Three days later, the Army of Sambre and Meuse, under the temporary direction of Kléber, won another clash with Wartensleben at Forchheim on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to {{a tropical}} cyclone {{and gave it}} the name Tam, making it the first named storm of the 2005–06 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65km/h (40mph). By 0000UTC on January13, the JTWC classified Tam as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds aloft, it was forecast to intensify. Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds aloft {{had little effect on}} the storm, allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85km/h (50mph) around 0600UTC. However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the center. Around 0000UTC on January14, Tam entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. With <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> estimated at 75km/h (45mph) almost due south, the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when Tam reached 33°S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the storm persisted for several hours before dissipating early on January15.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage {{on the opposite}} side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast <b>forward</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|With a Category4 {{hurricane}} forecast {{to track}} {{directly over the}} Leeward Islands, hurricane warnings were issued for several islands by September4. The ridge located north of Luis began to weaken by this time, leading to slower <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> to 12mph (19km/h). Outflow {{to the north of}} the hurricane weakened slightly as a distinct area of dry air developed around the weakening ridge. Late on September4, the hurricane's eye began to shrink, a possible indication of strengthening. An area of low pressure over Florida cut off from a trough would eventually cause Luis to slow significantly and cause a northward turn. On September5, Hurricane Luis weakened slightly, with winds decreasing to 135mph (215km/h), before tracking directly over Barbuda. The eyewall of the storm brushed Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Sustained winds on these islands were recorded up to 80mph (130km/h) with gusts up to 155mph (250km/h). The eye of Luis was estimated to be 46mi (74km) in diameter at this time. Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Luis to a Category3 hurricane as it passed through the islands due to the formation of concentric eyewalls; however, in post-season analysis, it was determined that the storm never weakened below Category4 status while passing through the Leeward Islands.|$|E
