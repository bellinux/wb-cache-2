The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the medium {{can be seen as a}} rejection of the alienation of labor practices.|$|E
5|$|Another World was {{innovative}} in <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> cinematic {{effects in}} both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced {{a number of}} other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as Flashback, Ico, Metal Gear Solid, and Silent Hill.|$|E
5|$|Following {{these two}} {{commercial}} successes, Mani {{wrote and directed}} Agni Natchathiram in 1988.

The film had a successful run in the box office.|$|E

2500|$|Perennially {{popular with}} readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn {{has also been}} the {{continued}} object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> extensive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and {{the tenor of the}} book are anti-racist, criticism of the book continued due to both <b>its</b> perceived <b>use</b> <b>of</b> racial stereotypes and <b>its</b> frequent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the racial slur [...] "nigger".|$|R

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the preface}} of The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, Merrifield {{noted that the}} book's bias was to the {{archaeology}} of London, {{and that this was}} particularly evident in <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Marilena from P7 also {{attracted}} the critics' attention due to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> explicit verbal and visual content. Cristian Nemescu {{said that this}} kind of scenes were a necessarily element for the realism of the movie, declaring himself a partisan of explicit content.|$|E

5|$|Noted for <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{single and}} double-page illustrations, the series has been lauded {{as one of}} Simon and Kirby's most {{significant}} creations. It was briefly revived through reprints in 1955, and all six issues were reprinted in a hardcover edition by Marvel Comics in 1991 with an introduction by Jim Simon.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time was {{critically}} acclaimed by the media, gaining an aggregate score of 86 from Metacritic.

5|$|A German Linux {{programmer}} from gpl-violations.org {{obtained a}} preliminary injunction against Fortinet's UK subsidiary in April 2005, due to {{allegations that the}} company was using encryption to hide <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Linux kernels that are subject to a General Public License (GPL).

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

5|$|Among other things, {{the episode}} was {{inspired}} by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 Roswell Incident. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical Rent and an episode of Ally McBeal. Originally, Darren McGavin was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in Ontario, California. The episode has been critically examined for <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> literary motifs, its fairy tale-like structure, and its themes concerning racism and alienation.|$|E
5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and {{public interest in}} the animals grew.

5|$|Blues is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. The most important characteristics of the blues is <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the blue scale, with a flatted or indeterminate third, as well as the typically lamenting lyrics; though both of these elements had existed in African American folk music prior to the 20th century, the codified form of modern blues (such as with the AAB structure) did not exist until the early 20th century.|$|E
