40|$|Observed X-ray {{spectra of}} some {{isolated}} magnetized neutron stars display absorption features, sometimes interpreted as ion cyclotron lines. Modeling the observed spectra {{is necessary to}} check this hypothesis and to evaluate neutron star parameters. We develop a computer code for modeling magnetized neutron star atmospheres {{in a wide range}} of magnetic fields (10 ^ 12 - 10 ^ 15 G) and effective temperatures (3 × 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 7 K). Using this code, we study the possibilities to explain the soft X-ray spectra of isolated neutron stars by different atmosphere models. The atmosphere is assumed to consist either of fully ionized electron-ion plasmas or of partially ionized hydrogen. Vacuum resonance and partial mode conversion are taken into account. Any inclination of the magnetic field relative to the stellar surface is allowed. We use modern opacities of fully or partially ionized plasmas in strong magnetic fields and solve the coupled radiative transfer equations for the normal electromagnetic modes in the plasma. Spectra of outgoing radiation are calculated for various <b>atmosphere</b> models: fully <b>ionized</b> semi-infinite <b>atmosphere,</b> thin <b>atmosphere,</b> partially <b>ionized</b> hydrogen <b>atmosphere,</b> or novel "sandwich" atmosphere (thin atmosphere with a hydrogen layer above a helium layer.

30|$|Radio {{occultation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} applications of radio science in space missions, and has played a central role in determining the vertical structures of planetary atmospheres from the early stage of the planetary exploration in the 1960 ’s (e.g., Eshleman et al., 1987; Tyler, 1987). In a radio occultation experiment conducted with an orbiter, the spacecraft transmits radio waves toward a tracking station on the earth and sequentially goes behind the planet’s ionosphere, neutral atmosphere, and solid planet as seen from the tracking station, and reemerges in the reverse sequence. During such occultation events the neutral and <b>ionized</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the planet cause bending, attenuation and scintillation of the radio waves, from which information on the atmosphere along the ray path is obtained. Under the assumption of local spherical symmetry, the measurements yield vertical profiles of refractive index and absorption coefficient. The refractive index profiles yield temperature profiles by assuming hydrostatic balance. Among the merits of this technique are its high vertical resolution and temperature resolution, which are discussed in Sections 4.4 and 5.4.|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. The {{partially}} ionized part of {{the solar}} atmosphere is investigated {{within the framework of}} a single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description including the non-ideal effects such as the Hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion in the generalized Ohm’s Law. In this paper, we study the propagation and damping of an Alfvén-like mode in the partially <b>ionized</b> solar <b>atmosphere.</b> It is found that the Hall effect, in addition to introducing strong dispersion, breaks the symmetry between the co- and the counter-propagating wave modes at the length scale approaching the Hall length-scale.

30|$|After {{the initial}} ionospheric {{disturbances}} propagating in a radial {{direction from the}} east of the epicenter, the zonal wave fronts were formed and traveled southward as seen in Fig. 1 (d). This zonal alignment of the wave front {{is similar to that of}} medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) in the daytime at a mid-latitude region. These are caused by the fact that an atmospheric gravity wave, propagating in the meridional direction, receives less effect of drag from the <b>ionized</b> <b>atmosphere</b> because the mobility of the <b>ionized</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is high along a geomagnetic field line. Heki and Ping (2005) and Otsuka et al. (2006) showed that the amplitude of TEC disturbances generated by earthquakes depend on the propagation direction: equa-torward propagating waves have much larger amplitudes than those propagating in other directions. In this study, we have observed the stronger southward/equatorward propagating TEC disturbances. This also indicates that the directivity of the disturbance propagation is affected by the magnetic field effect, propagating in a field-aligned direction. However, the declination angle at 35 °N and 130 °E is − 6.35 ° calculated by the IGRF- 10 model (Maus et al., 2005), which means that the initial TEC disturbance did not propagate fully along the magnetic field lines. It is clarified by this study that the evolution and propagation of fast propagating phenomena following an earthquake is not as simple as might be expected. At first, a zonal wave front is formed by the radial expansion of the disturbance. The velocity of the expansion is up to 3, 500 m/s as shown by Tsugawa et al. After the formation of the zonal wave front, this propagated equatorward/southward with a velocity of about 1, 000 – 1, 700 m/s.|$|E
30|$|When the {{acoustic}} wave propagates vertically, the wave front of {{the acoustic}} wave is almost horizontal above the source region.

The vertical motion of the electron {{does not change the}} vertical integration of the electron, the TEC, if the recombination of plasma is assumed to be small. The existence of the horizontal structure of the TEC in the acoustic resonant region indicates that the effect of the geomagnetic field, the tilt of the ionosphere, and the recombination of plasma, should be taken into account to discuss the ionospheric variations observed by GPS. Further detailed analysis is necessary to discuss the relation between the acoustic wave and the TEC variations.|$|E

40|$|Radio {{astronomy}} {{has provided}} evidence {{for the presence of}} <b>ionized</b> <b>atmospheres</b> around almost all classes of non-degenerate stars. Magnetically confined coronae dominate in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Their radio emission is predominantly of non-thermal origin and has been identified as gyrosynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic electrons, apart from some coherent emission mechanisms. Ionized winds are found in hot stars and in red giants. They are detected through their thermal, optically thick radiation, but synchrotron emission has been found in many systems as well. The latter is emitted presumably by shock-accelerated electrons in weak magnetic fields in the outer wind regions. Radio emission is also frequently detected in pre-main sequence stars and protostars, and has recently been discovered in brown dwarfs. This review summarizes the radio view of the atmospheres of non-degenerate stars, focusing on energy release physics in cool coronal stars, wind phenomenology in hot stars and cool giants, and emission observed from young and forming stars.

Comparisons between data obtained in and around Jicamarca, Peru, near the magnetic equator, and simulations with the TIEGCM indicate good progress has been made but reveal some serious discrepancies. Good-to-excellent agreement is obtained for electron densities, electron and ion temperatures, and nmax. The agreement is fair to poor for hmax, zonal drifts, the 630 nm oxygen nightglow, and the horizontal neutral winds. The most important discrepancy is in the simulated neutral temperature, which is at least 100 K too cold relative to Fabry–Perot interferometer observations. Increasing the EUV?uxes in the model to improve prediction of the model temperature also improves representation of air-glow observations and of the ionosphere, for which the model typically underrepresents the electron densities.
