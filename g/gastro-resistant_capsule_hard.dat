The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the variation of preparations of capsules coating with cellulose acetate phthalate and methacrylic acid copolymer, without drug addition, in 7 - 10 % coating concentrations, prepared manually with four or five immersions in tested coating solution. Results were analyzed considering the formulation’s disintegration test. Within the context of formulations under analysis, it was observed that the capsules coated with cellulose acetate phthalate 10 % complied with the pharmacopeia’s disintegration specifications. However, capsules coated with methacrylic acid copolymer did not show accordance with the pharmacopeia’s specifications.

30|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>capsules</b> on GI distress, bicarbonate bioavailability and subsequent acid-base responses following NaHCO 3 ingestion. The main finding was that delayed-release NaHCO 3 mitigated GI distress, as hypothesised. Fewer GI symptoms (~[*] 45.1 %) were reported with the delayed-release capsules, and the overall severity was reduced (~[*] 47.1 %) {{when compared to the}} aqueous solution. Interestingly, reductions in GI symptoms were due to gastric but not intestinal symptoms, a finding that has been suggested in the relevant literature [15]. Gastrointestinal symptoms were negated with the delayed-release capsules, with a reduction in the most severe symptom experienced up to 3 [*]h following supplementation (Table  1). Given that GI symptoms may be ergolytic [13, 14, 26], delayed-release NaHCO 3 may be more ergogenic in those who experience severe GI distress with the aqueous solution. Furthermore, since GI distress may deter some individuals from using NaHCO 3 as an ergogenic aid [7, 10], delayed-release NaHCO 3 would appear to be a more favourable option for athletes and coaches.|$|R
30|$|Polymeric-coated {{compounds}} {{can resist}} gastric degradation and reduce GI symptoms provoked by acid sensitive compounds, such as NaHCO 3 [15]. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, contained in delayed-release capsules, can resist degradation in acidic environments (pH ~[*] 1 – 2 arbitrary units (AU)), and therefore, provides gastro-resistant properties. Instead, degradation {{occurs in the}} duodenum where the pH is far more alkaline (pH ~[*] 6 – 7 [*]AU) and absorption can take place rapidly. Since GI distress is partly attributable to degradation in the stomach [8], {{it has been suggested}} that <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>capsules</b> may alleviate symptoms that are typical with NaHCO 3 ingestion [16]. Given that less bicarbonate is lost in the stomach, it has also been suggested that smaller doses may produce comparable acid-base changes to larger doses [16]. In contrast, as gut transit time is reduced with gastro-resistant formulations [15], this may reduce bicarbonate bioavailability when administered in this form. No study to date has examined the use of delayed-release NaHCO 3 on markers of GI distress, nor on bicarbonate bioavailability and subsequent blood acid-base responses. Reducing GI distress following NaHCO 3 ingestion may enhance use by athletes, particularly among those who are deterred by potential side-effects.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} value of {{long-chain}} omega- 3 fatty acids (FAs) supplementation in addition to amino-salicylic-acid (5 -ASA) in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients (20 males and 18 females, mean age 10. 13 years, range 5 - 16 years) with CD in remission were randomized into two groups and treated for 12 mo. Group I (18 patients) received 5 -ASA (50 mg/kg/d) + omega- 3 FAs as triglycerides in <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>capsules,</b> 3 g/d (eicosapentanoic acid, EPA, 400 mg/g, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 200 mg/g). Group II (20 patients) received 5 -ASA (50 mg/kg/d) + olive oil placebo capsules. Patients were evaluated for fatty acid incorporation in red blood cell membranes by gas chromatography at baseline 6 and 12 mo after the treatment. RESULTS: The number of patients who relapsed at 1 year was significantly lower in group I than in group II (P < 0. 001). Patients in group I had {{a significant increase in}} the incorporation of EPA and DHA (P < 0. 001) and a decrease in the presence of arachidonic acids.

The MSKE-loaded pectinate beads were prepared using ionotropic gelation with varying pectin-to-MSKE ratios, MSKE concentrations, and concentrations of two cross-linkers (calcium chloride and zinc acetate). The formulated beads were spherical in shape and ranged in size between 1. 13 mm and 1. 88 mm. Zinc-pectinate (ZPG) beads containing high amounts of MSKE showed complete entrapment efficiency (EE) of MSKE (100 %), while calcium-pectinate (CPG) beads demonstrated 70 % EE. The in vitro release tests indicated that MSKE-loaded CPG beads were unstable in both simulated gastric medium (SGM) and simulated intestinal medium (SIM), while MSKE-loaded ZPG beads were stable in SIM but unable to prevent the release of MSKE in SGM. The protection of ZPG beads with <b>gastro-resistant</b> <b>capsules</b> (Eudragit® L 100 - 55) resulted in stability in both SGM and SIM; they disintegrated immediately in simulated colonic medium containing pectinolytic enzymes. MSKE-loaded ZPG beads were stable at 4, 25 and 45 °C during the study period of four months.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the dissolution rate and bioavailability, solid dispersions of evodiamine in PVP K 30 with different enriched samples of evodiamine to PVP K 30 ratios were prepared by solvent method. Our studies showed that the dissolution rate of evodiamine was significantly higher in the solid dispersion system in comparison with that in enriched samples of evodiamine or physical mixtures. The increase of the dissolution rate was evidently related to the ratio of evodiamine to PVP K 30. The solid dispersion system (enriched samples of evodiamine/PVP K 30 = 1 / 6, w/w) gave the highest dissolution rate: about 27. 7 -fold {{higher than that of}} enriched samples of evodiamine in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules.</b> Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that enriched samples of evodiamine presented a total chemical stability after its preparation as solid dispersions.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Purpose: The {{therapeutic}} equivalence {{of multiple}} registered fenofibrate formulations, several {{of which are}} suprabioavailable and therefore marketed at lower dosage strengths than their reference products, {{is based on the}} results of bioequivalence studies. Most of these formulations show a higher bioavailability when taken with a high-fat meal. The relative bioavailability of two of these formulations, the 200 mg Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> and the 145 mg nanoparticle tablets, was assessed when taken with a high-fat meal. Methods: In this single dose, 2 -way, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received a 200 mg fenofibrate Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Test) and a 145 mg nanoparticle tablet (Reference) under high-fat fed conditions. Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid were measured up to 72 hours by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Results: The geometric mean ratios (Test/Reference) and the 90 % confidence intervals for AUC 0 -t and Cmax were 1. 37 (131. 58 – 142. 88) and 1. 38 (124. 60 – 152. 93), respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for improving oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drug, silymarin. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using ethyl linoleate, Cremophor EL, ethyl alcohol, and normal saline to identify the efficient self-microemulsification region. The particle size and its distribution of the resultant microemulsions were determined using dynamic light scattering. The optimal formulation with the best self-microemulsifying and solubilization ability consisted of 10 % (w/w) of ethyl linoleate, 30 % of Cremophor EL, and 60 % of ethyl alcohol.

However, baiting may not be appropriate if non-target species {{are at risk of}} poisoning. Here we use a desktop decision tree approach to assess the risks to non-target vertebrate species in Australia that arise from using poison baits developed to control feral house cats (Felis catus). These baits are presented in the form of sausages with toxicant implanted in the bait medium within an acid-soluble polymer <b>capsule</b> (<b>hard</b> shell delivery vehicle, or HSDV) that disintegrates after ingestion. Using criteria based on body size, diet and feeding behaviour, we assessed 221 of Australia’s 3, 769 native vertebrate species as likely to consume cat-baits, with 47 of these likely to ingest implanted HSDVs too. Carnivorous marsupials were judged most likely to consume both the baits and HSDVs, with some large-bodied and ground-active birds and reptiles also consuming them. If criteria were relaxed, a further 269 species were assessed as possibly able to consume baits and 343 as possibly able to consume HSDVs; most of these consumers were birds. One threatened species, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) was judged as definitely able to consume baits with implanted HSDVs, whereas five threatened species of birds and 21 species of threatened mammals were rated as possible consumers. Amphibia were not considered to be at risk.

Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: <b>Hard</b> <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas soft capsules disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min.
