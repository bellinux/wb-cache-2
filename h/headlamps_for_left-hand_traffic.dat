50|$|Despite {{not being}} {{available}} in the UK and Ireland, some Sebring convertibles have been bought in from the U.S. as grey-imports. Some Euro-spec models have also been privately imported, mostly from Germany. The European versions are easier to re-register in the UK as they have EU-type approval. The dual km/h-mph speedo-display and twin rear foglights mean only <b>headlamp</b> beam-aim adjustment <b>for</b> <b>left-hand</b> <b>traffic</b> is necessary. The sedan is much rarer in the UK though; a few EU models have been imported, but most {{are likely to be}} North American 'grey-imports'.|$|R

50|$|One notable form of yadaya is the {{construction}} of pagodas, as seen in {{the construction}} of 60,000 pagodas by U Nu in 1961.

50|$|Drive-through {{designs are}} {{different}} from restaurant to restaurant; however, most drive-throughs can accommodate four to six passenger cars or trucks at once (called the queue).

There are a few drive-through lanes designed with the service windows on the passenger side, but these lanes are disfavored as they cannot be used easily by cars with only a driver.|$|R
