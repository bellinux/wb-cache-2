40|$|The {{experimental}} study {{presented in this}} paper consists of two series of tests concerned with jointing performance of wood screws for particleboard. In the first series of test, withdrawal test of wood wcrews from the face or edge of particleboard were performed. In withdrawal tests, the sizes of wood screw and pilot hole were varied and the driving torque was also measured. In the second series of tests, two specimens (rail and post) of particleboard were constructed in the form of L-type with wood screws, Knife thread <b>insert</b> <b>nuts</b> or adhesive, and the rail was placed in the flat position. The bending load (out-of-plane force) was applied to it, and static and repetitive bending tests of L-type construction were carried out. And from the measured results, the angular stiffness of the L-type construction was calculated from Eq. (82 ̆ 7). The results obtained are as follows. (1) Under a constant diameter of wood screw, driving torque and withdrawal resistance increase with increase of the length of screw. However, under a constant length of wood screw, driving torque increases with increase of the diameter of screw, but withdrawal resistance decreases. These results indicate that it is more effective to use longer wood screws than to use thicker screws. (2) Withdrawal resistance of each size of wood screw is affected by the diameterratio of pilot hole to wood screw and it shows the largest value at the diameter ratio 0. 5. Considering a labor efficency at the jointing work, however, it seems better to use the diameter ratio 0. 6 to 0. 7. (3) The bending fracture load of L-type constructinos connected with wood screws is affected considerably by the length of wood screw and is under control of the internal bond strength of particleboard. The angular stiffness of L-type construction depends on both withdrawal resistance and the resistanceto the deformation of the wood screw caused by bending load. The fracture load and the angular stiffness show larger values in the case that the L-type construction is connected with <b>insert</b> <b>nuts</b> than those in the case of wood screws. (4) The strength and the stiffness of L-type construction are improved by jointing with both wood screws and adhesive. Especially, by use of epoxy resin, the strength increases remarkably. (5) The fatigue strength of L-type construction connected with each type of joints is in proportion approximately to their static strength. パーティクルボードを供試材料として,その接合部の性能を評価するための基礎資料を得る目的から,案内孔寸法と木ねじのねじ込みトルクおよび引抜き抵抗との関係,ならびに木ねじ,ねじ込み式ナットおよび接着剤による接合部の静的あるいは繰返し曲げ荷重に対する強度および剛性について基礎実験を行ない,以下の結論を得た. (1) 長さの異なる木ねじについては,引抜き抵抗はねじ込みトルクに比例して増加するが,直径の異なる場合は,ねじ込みトルクの増加に伴う引抜き抵抗の増加が少ない. また,各寸法の木ねじに対して,その引抜き抵抗は案内乳棒比がほぼ 0. 5 のときに最大値をとる. (2) 木ねじにより接合したしL字試験片に此げ荷重を加えた場合,その破壊荷重は木ねじの長さおよび棚板の内部結合力に支配される. また,角度変化に関する剛性は,木ねじの引抜き抵抗および曲げあるいさません断=よる変形に対する抵抗に支配される. (3) ねじ込み式ナットを用いて接合した場合は,圧入式のAタイプを除いて, 強度および剛性ともに木ねじの場合より高い値を示す. (4) 木ねじと接旨剤を併用することにより,強度および剛性ともに改善することができる. とくに,エポキシ樹脂接着剤を用いた場合,強度を著しく向上することができ,その破壊形態にも頓著な差異が認められる. (5) 繰返し曲げ試験では,いずれの接合法においても,荷重と破壊繰返し数との間には,両対数グラフ上で負の直線相関が認められる. また,疲労強度は静的強度に支配される...|$|R

50|$|Nutcrackers in {{the form}} of wood carvings of a soldier, knight, king, or other {{profession}} have existed since at least the 15th century. Figurative nutcrackers are a good luck symbol in Germany, and a folk tale recounts that a puppet-maker won a nutcracking challenge by creating a doll with a mouth for a lever to crack the nuts. These nutcrackers portray a person with a large mouth which the operator opens by lifting a lever {{in the back of the}} figurine. Originally one could <b>insert</b> a <b>nut</b> in the big-toothed mouth, press down and thereby crack the nut. Modern nutcrackers in this style serve mostly for decoration, mainly at Christmas time, a season of which they have long been a traditional symbol.

40|$|A glassblock {{integrated}} with hybrid photovoltaic cells (also known as Dye-sensitized Solar Cell - DSC) and a dry-assembled panel made of traditional or DSC-integrated glassblocks are disclosed. The {{combination of the}} glassblock and the DSC module, allows {{the improvement of the}} glassblock performance in terms of energy saving and production. The final complete product owns the qualities of both the components (glassblock and DSC module) that are optimized to produce clean energy. The transparency and the thermo-acoustic insulation of the glassblock may be modulated according to the specific requirements of each case of installation. Since the DSCs can be printed in different colours and with various patterns, it is possible to intervene also on the glassblock aesthetical aspect and to easily make drawings on the building façades, thanks to the modularity of the glassblock and the panel. Moreover, DSCs can be energetically active in different light conditions (even in diffuse light, also converting internal artificial light) and independently from the angle of the solar radiation. The invention presents seven Hypotheses of integration of the DSCs with glassblock and the system to assemble the new product and/or the traditional glassblock in prestressed panels, which constitute the building envelope even in high-rise buildings. This assembly system implies favourable economies in terms of costs and materials, since further technical elements for the construction of the building envelope are no more needed. The supporting structure of the panel is constituted by plastic profiles that are placed in the horizontal and vertical cavities resulting from the juxtaposition of the glassblocks. The supporting structure houses stiffening steel rods and electric connections (in case of DSC-integrated glassblocks for the construction of photovoltaic panels). To overcome the limits due to the wet assembly system, traditionally used to assemble glassblocks, a prestressing force is applied to steel rods in order to confer to the panel an adequate mechanical resistance against the actions perpendicular to its installation plane, such as wind and earthquake. In this configuration the mechanical resistance of the glassblocks is exploited. The unidirectional prestress (along the prevalent dimension of the panel) is obtained through the grip of the <b>nuts</b> <b>inserted</b> in the steel rods, opposing to the steel plates positioned at {{the top and bottom of}} the panel. The steel plates are positioned on plastic plates fixed to the lateral faces of the glassblocks by means of resins...|$|R
