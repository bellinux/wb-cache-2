50|$|Maricite is {{a member}} of the {{phosphate}} mineral group. Phosphate minerals have one or more metal cations bonded to the phosphate anion PO4. (Hawthorne, F.C., 1998). In maricite the metals bonded to PO4 are sodium and iron (Sturman, et al., 1977). The empirical formula for maricite is NaFePO4 and it has a molar mass of 173.81 g/mol (Yahia, et al., 2008; Tremaine, Xiao, 1999). The general formula for maricite is ABPO4, (Yahia, et al., 2008). The chemical composition was originally found by Dr. Corlett from the Department of Geological Sciences at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario. The formula was determined using electron microprobe analysis, and the resulting formula was found to be, Na 0.91(Fe 0.89 Mn 0.07 Mg 0.03)P 1.02 O 4.00 (Sturman, et al., 1977) when normalized to four oxygen atoms. The weight percentages were determined using six different points on a thin section and averaging the percentages of each oxide in all of the samples. The results <b>in</b> <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> average of oxides are as follows: Na2O 16.5%, MgO 0.8%, CaO 0.0%, MnO 3.1%, FeO 37.4%, P2O5 42.5%, with a total of 100.3%. When looking at these results, one may determine that the majority of the oxide weight composition is made of FeO with P2O5 making up almost the same weight percentage. There is a significant percentage of the Na2O oxide and an insignificant percentage of the CaO oxide (~0). It is clear from looking at the oxide content of the mineral that the main components are going to be sodium, iron, phosphorus, and oxygen. The oxide factor may be used to determine the weight percentages of the individual elements as follows, 1 sodium atom totaling ~13% of composition, 1 iron atom totaling ~32% of composition, 1 phosphorus atom totaling ~18% of composition, and 4 oxygen atoms totaling ~37% of composition (Sturman, et al., 1977).|$|E
40|$|A contact-hole deprotection blur metric {{has been}} used to monitor the deprotection blur of an {{experimental}} open platform resist (EH 27) as the <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> of base and photo acid generator (PAG) were varied.

A 2 x increase <b>in</b> PAG <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> is shown to improve 1 : 1 line-space patterning from 47 nm to 40 nm without changing deprotection blur or isolated LER. A discussion of improved patterning performance as related to shot noise and deprotection blur concludes with a speculation that the spatial distribution of PAG molecules has been playing some role, perhaps a dominant one, in determining the uniformity of photo generated acids in the resists that have been studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} properties of Zn– 27 Al based composites reinforced with rice husk ash (RHA), silicon carbide (SiC), and graphite (Cg) particles have been investigated. The Zn– 27 Al composites consisting of varied weight ratios of the reinforcing materials were produced using the stir casting process. Hardness test, tensile properties evaluation, fracture toughness determination, and microstructural examination, {{were used to}} characterize the composites produced. Results show that the microstructures of the composites are similar, consisting of the dendritic structure of the Zn– 27 Al alloy matrix with fine dispersion of the reinforcing particles. The hardness of the composites decreased with increase <b>in</b> the <b>weight</b> <b>percent</b> of RHA (and corresponding decrease <b>in</b> SiC <b>weight</b> <b>percent)</b> <b>in</b> the reinforcement.

Although some of the composite compositions containing RHA had slightly higher % elongation values compared with those without RHA, it was generally observed that the % elongation was invariant to the composite RHA content.
