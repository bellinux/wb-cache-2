5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> {{were eventually}} leaked and made playable. Soon afterward, an unofficial restoration effort known as Chrono Trigger: Flames of Eternity became popular and aimed to fully complete the game's development, switching {{from using the}} <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> as a base to the latest released version. While it received heavy criticism from the first developers and a very mixed reaction from the fan base {{for some of the}} changes, it nonetheless is the most stable version of the game and is under active development.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Degas {{painted the}} scene of the Nuns' ballet twice. The <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> (1871) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1876 Degas painted a larger version for the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure (who had sung the part of Bertram); this version is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the script to the point that he considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E
5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. An <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> {{of the same}} technology powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.|$|E

50|$|Although some of {{the titles}} were not altered from <b>earlier</b> <b>versions,</b> both the cover artwork and the {{interior}} content were changed. Thus, {{it is easy to}} distinguish between the <b>early</b> <b>versions</b> and the latter issues by the cover art alone.|$|R
50|$|The Iwerks seating was an <b>early</b> <b>version</b> of {{a product}} now called Simex-Iwerks 4-D Seats.This <b>early</b> <b>version</b> was far less capable than the current model, with the major {{difference}} being the lack of the current motion simulator base (3 DOF) capabilities.|$|R

Besides the standard features, several GCC and Microsoft specific extensions are also supported.|$|R
5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the game.|$|E
5|$|The chassis {{was derived}} from the T1E2 chassis, an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the M13. Based on an M3 Half-track chassis, it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{difference}} in tone between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E

5|$|An <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of {{the film}} that was edited before it was {{publicly}} screened had included a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes {{of life on the}} base, and Floyd buying a bush baby from a department store via videophone for his daughter. A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} politics, Southey {{believed}} that {{war with the}} post-revolution France was inappropriate when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed {{to the government of}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The poem is also heavily grounded in Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans to travel from Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the <b>earlier</b> <b>version,</b> which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E

5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Platform A4 {{divides the}} Group A plaza in two. It was a later {{addition}} to Group A during the reorganisation {{of the group}} that involved the destruction of the earlier building under Platform A5. When excavated it was very poorly reserved but was able to be reliably restored. There was no <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of the structure; it consists of a platform with two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A. The upper level is topped with a cornice and access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades.|$|E

The British Library brought together the four existing copies of the 1215 manuscript in February 2015 for a special exhibition. British artist Cornelia Parker was commissioned {{to create a new}} artwork, Magna Carta (An Embroidery), which was shown at the British Library between May and July 2015. The artwork is a copy of an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> of this Wikipedia page (as it appeared on the document's 799th anniversary, 15 June 2014), hand-embroidered by over 200 people.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Flame is a four-act play {{written by}} George V. Hobart and John Willard, who revised an <b>earlier</b> <b>version</b> by Leta Vance Nicholson. In 1920, {{producer}} Albert H. Woods staged the play on Broadway and on tour across the United States. Ruth Gordon, the main character, {{is a religious}} young woman who dies and is revived by her scientist fiancé as a soulless femme fatale. She seduces several men and involves them in crimes, including drug use and murder. In the final act, her death and resurrection are revealed to be a dream. The production starred Theda Bara, a popular silent film actress who was known for playing similar roles in movies.|$|E
5|$|The other version, {{from the}} Pranatoshini Tantra and {{attributed}} to Svatantra Tantra, is narrated by Shiva. He recounts that his consort Chandika (identified with Parvati) was engrossed in coitus {{with him in}} reverse posture, but became enraged at his seminal emission. Her attendants Dakini and Varnini rose from her body. The rest of the tale {{is similar to the}} <b>earlier</b> <b>version,</b> although the river is called Pushpabhadra, the day of Chhinnamasta's birth is called Viraratri, and upon seeing the pale Parvati, Shiva becomes infuriated and assumes the form of Krodha Bhairava. This version is retold in the Shaktisamgama Tantra (c. 16th century), in which Chinnamasta forms a triad with Kali and Tara.|$|E
