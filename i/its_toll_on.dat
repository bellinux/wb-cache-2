He spent the day working at the Festival of Britain site and trained {{three nights a week}} at Fulham. Eventually, this took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Robson and he gave up his trade for full-time professional football.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which opened it to the public as a historic house museum.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{coalmining}} {{activity was}} on the Faskine and Palacecraig estates, which were on the eastern extension. In 1820 the city of Glasgow was consuming [...] "half a million tons of coal a year, {{almost all of it}} subject to the high <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> the Monkland Canal". In 1828 a rival company claimed that The Monkland Canal had [...] "for many years yielded a dividend of Cent. per Cent ... arising solely <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>Tolls</b> <b>on</b> coal".|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the congregation, and {{membership}} dropped. In order {{to cope with}} the financial burdens, dues were raised, teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks, the Executive Secretary was laid off, pews were sold, and individual members provided mortgage guarantees. The synagogue survived, {{and membership}} recovered; by 1934 there were 300 members, and by 1944 there were 1,100.|$|E
5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the {{newspaper}} campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she {{not have a}} separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Philippe {{initially}} {{formed to}} the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening as it did so. Philippe became a hurricane on September 18 and stayed as such for two days before increasing wind shear from a non-tropical system took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> September 20 and weakened Philippe into a tropical storm. Philippe continued to weaken as it looped around this low and was absorbed by it on September 23.|$|E
5000|$|The Monkland Canal {{had opened}} in 1794, and {{provided}} a considerable stimulus to the coalpits in Monkland, and early iron workings were encouraged also. However, before the era of a proper road network, the canal had a virtual monopoly of transport, and it set its prices accordingly; so successful was its exploitation of the situation that it [...] "for many years yielded a dividend of Cent. per cent ... arising solely <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> coal".|$|R
50|$|Finally his ill-health took <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> and, <b>on</b> 7 September 1939, at 2:45 in the morning, Izumi Kyōka {{died of lung}} cancer. He {{is buried}} at Zōshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the Tyne Improvement Commission {{arranged}} for dredging and other works to improve the navigability of the River Tyne. For Newburn, it made the town not only easier to reach by boat, but necessitated {{the building of a}} river crossing, and so in 1893 Newburn Bridge was built. It was originally operated as a toll bridge, but was only freed of <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> 2 September 1947, making it the last bridge on the Tyne to do so.|$|R
5|$|The {{band had}} also {{incurred}} heavy legal {{expenses for the}} Penis Envy prosecution; this, combined with exhaustion and the pressures of living and operating together, finally took <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> <b>On</b> 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on the return trip guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E

5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite {{a slight increase}} in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to take <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E
5|$|Playing a {{physical}} style again took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Roberts' upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, {{he missed the}} first {{four and a half}} months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} had <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> <b>on</b> Sima Shi, however. He was ill {{with an eye}} disorder {{at the time that}} Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion started, and had just had an eye surgery. He was initially therefore reluctant to lead the forces himself and wanted his uncle Sima Fu to lead the forces against Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin. At the urging of Zhong Hui and Fu Gu (傅嘏), he led the troops himself, which was important in the victory against Guanqiu Jian, but during one of the raids made by Wen Qin's son Wen Yang (文鴦), Sima Shi, in his anxiety, aggravated the eye that he had just had the operation in—causing his eye to pop out—and his conditions soon deteriorated greatly. Less than a month after he put down the rebellion, he died while at Xuchang (許昌, in modern Xuchang, Henan), with his brother Sima Zhao in attendance to succeed him.|$|R
5|$|The New Zealanders' attack {{began with}} a night-time advance on 24 August by the 1st Infantry Brigade to clear the {{approaches}} to Bapaume, including Loupart Wood and Grévillers. Brigadier General Charles Melvill, commanding the brigade, was directed to move onto Bapaume if it {{were able to do}} so quickly. However, progress was delayed by heavy machine gun fire and artillery took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the supporting tanks allocated to the brigade. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous three days, the weather was poor. Despite this, Grévillers fell to the brigade along with 380 prisoners and several field guns. There were over 100 casualties among the attacking New Zealanders, including the commander of 2nd Auckland Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} demands {{of running a}} marathon every day took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken {{at the request of}} the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E

On the one hand, {{some members of the}} community in the nearby mill town of Fortuna strongly resented the presence of activists from other areas, as these were not aware of the potential economic impacts of logging stoppages. On the other hand, environmental activists like Chain believed that clearcutting was not sustainable and highlighted that the choice of jobs or the environment was a fallacy.|$|R

5|$|Woods' {{performance}} {{continued to}} suffer in 2011, taking <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 {{with a strong}} showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who {{was shocked by the}} dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.|$|E
5|$|World War II meant The Football League was {{suspended}} for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53. However, the war had taken <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.|$|E
5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Bonnie, giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decade of}} the 1990s began with an {{economic}} recession, taking <b>its</b> inevitable <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the automotive industry, and throwing GM into some of its worst losses. As a result, [...] "Jack" [...] Smith (not related to Roger) became burdened {{with the task of}} overseeing a radical restructuring of General Motors. Sharing Roger's understanding of the need for serious change, Jack undertook many major revisions. Reorganizing the management structure to dismantle the legacy of Alfred P. Sloan, instituting deep cost-cutting and introducing significantly improved vehicles were the key approaches. These moves were met with much less resistance within GM than had Roger's similar initiatives as GM management ranks were stinging from their recent near-bankruptcy experience and were much more willing to accept the prospect of radical change.|$|R
