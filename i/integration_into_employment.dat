30|$|The {{empirical}} {{analysis shows}} that <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> gainful <b>employment</b> or vocational training in companies {{is not the}} major route off benefits receipt for young beneficiaries. In most cases the benefits episodes are ended by other reasons in the household context (e.g. re-employment of the parents or partner). However, most surveyed young beneficiaries are not detached from employment or vocational training, as high numbers of them accept job or training positions {{that go along with}} further benefits receipt. The results of the multivariate analyses indicate that the young beneficiaries’ employment and training participation is dependent on individual qualifications, previous employment experience and unemployment experience, and the households’ constellation. The results can be interpreted as if getting off benefits is mainly a question of individual resources and the depending opportunity structures in the labour market. Moreover, young people seem to be more likely to become detached from the labour market in benefits receipt if they cannot reach <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> gainful <b>employment</b> in the long run.

30|$|In January 2005 the Social Code Book II {{came into}} effect in Germany. It {{introduced}} the new unemployment benefit II (Arbeitslosengeld II) as a major element and final stage {{of a series of}} labour market reforms termed the Hartz reforms which aimed at flexibilization of the German labour market and granted (re)integration of persons in need into the labour market precedence over pure economic subsidies. The new means tested benefit integrated the former social assistance (a welfare benefit) and the former unemployment assistance for long-term unemployed persons whose entitlement to unemployment insurance payments had expired. Its paradigm is summarized in the slogan “support and challenge” (in German “fördern und fordern”). Support for <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> was extended to groups that had formerly been far detached from the labour market. On the other hand status protection regulations were disestablished and pressure on recipients to take up any reasonable employment was increased by the introduction of benefit sanctions and active labour market programmes designed to test work motivation.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{analysed}} {{the effectiveness of}} single active labour market programmes (ALMPs) for welfare recipients in different countries. As empirical evidence reveals that welfare recipients in Germany often participate in multiple programmes, I evaluate the sequential participation of unemployment benefit II (UB-II) -recipients in ALMPs in Germany. My study uses comprehensive, administrative data to control for dynamic selection that arises {{in the evaluation of}} sequences. Using a dynamic matching approach and an inflow sample of UB-II-recipients, I analyse the effects of sequences of One-Euro-Jobs and/or UB-II-receipt on labour market outcomes. I focus on two questions: Is participating in two consecutive One-Euro-Jobs compared with receiving UB II for two consecutive periods better for individuals' employment outcomes? Is it more effective {{to take part in a}} One-Euro-Job directly after entry into UB II or in a later period? For female participants in One-Euro-Jobs in the first period, especially in West Germany, I find that participating in two consecutive One- Euro-Jobs compared with receiving UB-II-receipt for two consecutive periods better facilitates <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> regular <b>employment.</b> It is also more effective for participants in One-Euro-Jobs in the first period to take part in a One-Euro-Job directly after entry into UB II rather than take part in a One-Euro-Job in a later period, especially for East German men (although not for West German women).

30|$|The {{well-developed}} {{research on}} benefits dynamics among adult recipients emphasises {{the relevance of}} labour market transitions to come off benefits. These findings might be relevant for young beneficiaries in particular who have already started their first job or an own family and are therefore in life situations comparable to older benefits clients. For the 18 - to 64 -year-old beneficiaries, <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> {{is one of the}} most important ways off benefits, further reasons for leaving benefits receipt are e.g. by the partner’s entry into work or by marriage, and administrative reasons (Buhr 1995; Gangl 1998; Gebauer 2007; Gebauer and Vobruba 2003; Gebauer et al. 2003, studies refer to previous social assistance; see Graf 2007 for the first evidence on current social benefit). Studies indicate that leaving benefits receipt by job entry is mainly the matter of individual employment opportunities depending on firstly, individual qualifications, secondly, domestic circumstances and thirdly, demand conditions on the labour market according to the economic cycle (Andreß and Strengmann-Kuhn 1997; Buhr and Weber 1998; Gangl 1998; Gebauer 2007; Gebauer and Vobruba 2003; Hoynes 2000). However, further studies emphasise that the financial situation of the household (Wilde 2003), individual wage expectations and labour supply of benefits recipients are significant as well (Schneider and Uhlendorff 2005; Schwarze and Raderschall 2002).|$|E
30|$|Program Description Labor market {{training}} courses {{are one of}} the main interventions used to integrate unemployed individuals into employment. The training content can be very heterogenous, ranging from purely classroom-based training to purely on-the-job training within firms, with varying durations between a couple of weeks to over one year. The purpose of these labor market training programs is to extend or to adapt the labor market relevant skill set of participants, so that a faster and more stable <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> can be achieved. Training programs within firms serve the additional purpose of providing youth with some level of work experience and send productivity signals to employers, making them potentially more likely to hire participants later on. This additional “foot-in-the-door” effect of within-company training may be particularly relevant for youth with limited signals of prior labor market participation. It may hence be expected that, all else equal, within-firm training has a better employment effect than formal classroom training. At the same time, by being more practically oriented, firm-based training tends to be offered predominantly to disadvantaged youth with stronger barriers towards direct labor market integration. This differential selection into classroom-based and school-based training programs suggests that the evaluation results for these two programs are not readily comparable.|$|E

40|$|Job search {{assistance}} and intensified counseling {{have been found}} to be effective for labor market integration by a large number of studies, but the evidence for older and hard-to-place unemployed individuals more specifically is mixed. In this paper we present key results from the evaluation of "Perspektive 50 plus", a large-scale active labor market program directed at the older unemployed in Germany. To identify the treatment effects, we exploit regional variation in program participation. Based on survey evidence, we argue that participation of regions is not endogenous in the vast majority of cases. We use a combination of different evaluation estimators to check the sensitivity of the results to selection, substitution and local labor market effects. We find large positive effects of the program in the range of five to ten percentage points on <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> unsubsidized <b>employment.</b> However, there are also substantial lock-in effects, such that program participants have a higher probability of remaining on public welfare benefit receipt for up to one year after commencing the program...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} half of 2017 Latin American and Caribbean labour markets {{followed}} two main trends. On the one hand, as described {{in the first part of}} this report, the main indicators continued to deteriorate as a result of slack economic growth, as has been the case for several years. The empoyment rate continued to decrease, while the unemployment rate continued to rise. On the other hand, the pace of this deterioration has continued to slow, which could signal “light at the end of the tunnel”. Young people tend to be among the hardest hit by downturns in labour markets. They also face structural problems of <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> and decent work. The second part of this report is devoted to the issue of the transition between the education system and the labour market and analyses this trajectory using data from household surveys and School-to-Work Transition Surveys (SWTS). Young people’s paths into the labour market in the region are found to be generally much longer than in the developed countries, something that is heavily shaped by the role of women, often still centred on caregiving and household activities. The analysis of these transitions has been made more complex by the fact that most young people pass through different activity statuses before becoming established in employment...|$|E
30|$|As {{in other}} European welfare states, social policy in Germany {{focuses on the}} special needs of young people at risk of poverty and labour market exclusion. However, there has been very little {{empirical}} research to assess poverty and benefits claims during the transition to adulthood. The existing literature discusses young adults’ financial hardship as a transitory experience caused by prolonged education, unemployment or family formation that may be overcome through <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> (Aassve et al. 2006). But if young people fail to become established in stable employment they face a high risk of recurrent unemployment and social benefits receipt (Kieselbach 2003). It is suggested that long-term benefits receipt during the vulnerable transition to adulthood is a profoundly negative experience that may limit young adults’ further development (France 2008; Furlong 2000). Therefore the concern of the political discourse in Germany is that young people with few prospects may withdraw from the labour market and become resigned to benefits dependency. The underlying assumption of this perception of welfare dependency is that continuing periods on benefits are the consequence of the young beneficiaries’ behaviour in response to their opportunities and to their experiences of public support and unemployment (Bane and Ellwood 1994). Hence, further qualification and activation against a familiarisation to benefits receipt for the under- 25 s became a priority on the agenda of the German benefits system (German Bundestag 2003).|$|E
40|$|The study {{explores the}} way out of benefit receipt by labour market {{integration}} of young adults in Germany. Under 25 -year-olds are a target group of the German social policy. If they rely on the payment of social benefits a prompt <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> or training is the main priority. The aim is to prevent young people from long-term benefit dependency. The causes of long-term benefit receipt can be discussed from different perspectives: Based on diverse labour market theories, poor perspectives of young benefit recipients can depend on low labour market opportunities. But in the political and public discourse in Germany, long-term benefit receipt of young adults is mostly regarded as the consequence of young people's low labour supply and resignation in benefit dependency. The article examines the chances to leave benefit dependency by labour market integration of about 650 18 - to 24 -year-old benefit recipients in 2005. The analysis is based on the survey 'Life Circumstances and Social Security 2005 ' of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany and on longitudinal register data of the Federal Employment Agency for three years, 2005 to 2007. The analyses show that most young benefit recipients enter a job or training during the observed period of time; though in many cases young adults keep on receiving benefits. Long-term benefit dependency is predominantly a matter of poor job prospects of low qualified young people and young single parents. But {{there is no evidence that}} ongoing benefit claims may go hand in hand with young people's poor labour supply.

30|$|For {{those young}} people who are {{available}} for job or training integration, theoretical considerations accentuate the meaning of individual resources for the young beneficiaries’ matching processes on the labour market. Thus the opportunities to exit benefits receipt via company-based training (Dietrich and Gerner 2007; Lex 1997) or via gainful employment depend on the employers’ demand for productive employees with certain labour market resources; in return, they reward accumulated resources by higher-level job positions (Sørensen and Kalleberg 1994). Relevant individual resources are accentuated by screening and signalling theories (Stiglitz 1975; Spence 1973): based on the productivity assumptions of human capital theory, general qualifications and specific job experience are indispensable (Becker 1962) while times of economic inactivity—especially long-term unemployment—lead to human capital depreciation (Mincer and Ofek 1982) and may go hand in hand with selective recruitment. The assumptions for the empirical analysis are that skilled young adults have improved chances of exiting benefits receipt that {{can be traced back to}} privileged recruiting and training prospects and access to advantaged job positions with good pay. In contrast, disadvantaged labour market groups such as the long-term unemployed are expected to have few opportunities to exit benefits receipt through <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> gainful <b>employment</b> (Hypothesis  5). Disadvantages on the labour market may either derive in joblessness or <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> poor jobs when people have to mix employment income by further benefits receipt.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a strong}} effect that young {{beneficiaries}} in long-term unemployment realise a partial exit and reduce benefits receipt via labour market integration. According to Hypothesis  5 that young unemployed experience reduced opportunities to exit benefits receipt through labour market integration, {{the results can be}} interpreted as if young long-term unemployed switch to low-paid jobs when they are filtered out of gainful job positions by employers during recruitment processes and only have access to marginal job positions. This interpretation is supported by the descriptive finding that partial exits are mostly due to <b>integration</b> <b>into</b> marginal <b>employment</b> (see previous section). As a consequence, some young beneficiaries seem to experience employment careers on state support. A previous partial exit via labour market integration has a positive effect on the probability that the young people experience further partial exits, but it does not significantly promote a final exit via labour market integration. The probability of exiting benefits receipt by labour market integration is reduced when the young beneficiaries have accumulated a rising number of employment episodes and unemployment experience which are indicators for a discontinuous employment career. Young people may be trapped in a series of temporary jobs and recurrent unemployment that limits their employment and financial perspectives in the long run as already shown by previous empirical literature.|$|R
