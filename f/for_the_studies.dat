25|$|All {{combined}} hormonal {{birth control}} products {{have a very}} small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A {{recent study found that}} users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35µg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> are overlapping.|$|E
500|$|A 2010 paper {{written by}} Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice, {{suggests}} that asexuality {{may be somewhat}} of a question in itself <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of gender and sexuality. Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society {{to be the most}} basic of instincts. Their New Orientations paper states that society has deemed [...] " [...] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [...] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities." [...] In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically-determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LeVay's blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.|$|E

2500|$|Knowledge of unilingual access has inevitably led to {{the curiosity}} of bilingual lexical access. Early models of bilingual lexical access shared similar {{characteristics}} with these unilingual lexical access models. For example, the bilingual models began with focusing on whether the lexical access for bilinguals would be different from monolinguals. In addition to study the activation process in separate language, they also investigated whether the lexical activation would be processed in a parallel fashion for both languages or selectively processed for the target language. In this case, the bilingual models also studied whether the bilingual system has a single lexicon combining words from both languages or separate lexicons for words in each language. With the occurrence of widespread computational modeling, researchers extended the theoretical approaches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of bilingual lexical access.The computational models are now essential component for mainstream theories, for example, the models of Bilingual Interactive Activation [...] model, ...|$|E

60|$|A {{year and}} more was already past since Xavier had laboured in the {{conversion}} of the Paravas; and in all this time, his two companions, Paul de Camerine, and Francis Mansilla, were not come to his assistance, though they had been arrived at Goa some months since. The number of Christians daily multiplying to a prodigy, and one only priest not being sufficient to cultivate so many new converts in the faith, or advance them in Christian piety, the saint thought it his duty to look out for succour. And besides, having selected some young men, well-natured, and of a good understanding, qualified <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of divinity, and human sciences, who being themselves well modelled, might return with him to instruct their countrymen; he was of opinion, that he ought to conduct them himself, without deferring his voyage any longer.|$|E
60|$|What disgusted {{the painter}} most was that, {{with all his}} belief in the wickedness of the fine world, it was clear that Jeff would have willingly been of it; and he divined that if he had any strong {{aspirations}} they were for society and for social acceptance. He had fancied, when the fellow seemed to care so little <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> of the university, that he might come forward in its sports. Jeff gave more and more the effect of tremendous strength in his peculiar physique, though there was always the disappointment of not finding him tall. He was of the middle height, but he was hewn out and squared upward massively. He felt like stone to any accidental contact, and the painter brought away a bruise from the mere brunt of his shoulders. He learned that Jeff was a frequenter of the gymnasium, where his strength must have been known, but he could not make out that he had any standing among the men who went in for athletics. If Jeff had even this, the sort of standing in college which he failed of would easily have been won, too. But he had been falsely placed at the start, or some quality of his nature neutralized other qualities that would have made him a leader in college, and he remained one of the least forward men in it. Other jays won favor and liking, and ceased to be jays; Jeff continued a jay. He was not chosen into any of the nicer societies; those that he joined when he thought they were swell he could not care for when he found they were not.|$|E
