5|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> thought St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, {{with its}} thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E

25|$|Prevented {{from playing}} {{the first few}} games by injury and unable to contain his {{excessive}} drinking and increasing weight, Richardson declined still more sharply in 1899. Though after returning to the Surrey eleven he produced some impressive performances (notably against Kent at the Oval), Richardson failed to take 100 wickets for the season. As a result, {{he was out of}} the running for Test selection, and the benefit Surrey gave him for his service between 1893 and 1897 was much less lucrative than <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> hoped despite Surrey winning the Championship.|$|E

25|$|Around 35 {{people were}} {{believed}} to have been on the ride when thick smoke began to escape from the tunnel doors. Ride staff raised the alarm, and began to pull people from the ride as their cars exited the tunnel. It was initially thought that <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> escaped the fire, but at around 11:30 pm, the bodies of seven people were found inside the ride: John Godson and his two children, Damien and Craig, and four Waverley College students; Jonathon Billings, Richard Carroll, Michael Johnson, and Seamus Rahilly. At the time of the fire, investigating police speculated that the seven had climbed out of their cars and unsuccessfully tried to find {{their way out of the}} tunnel; had they stayed in the cars, they might have survived. Other evacuated passengers reported seeing empty cars exit the tunnel on fire.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} churches were {{established}} in Jämtland during the medieval period they were done so by {{a small number of}} farmers. Estimations show that there were seldom more than 30 to 40 farmers in each parish. In some cases, like in Kyrkås, Marby and Norderö parish the farmers were probably 20 or less. These original parishioners built churches that's lasted for centuries, many are still existing and functioning today. This is quite remarkable given that they built these churches in stones, much larger than their ordinary timber houses and in a material the parishioners were not accustomed to (given that they only used timber). The churches became a matter of concern for every parishioner, the centre in each parish. <b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> to help build them and their descendants had to maintain them, this carried on for generations. Families have decorated the churches throughout history with various ornaments and art such as valuable inventories, wood carvings, paintings (predominantly biblical illustrations), textiles, silver and tin along with various handicrafts. Almost the entire older popular culture in Jämtland is tied to the churches. Making them the core of Jämtland's cultural heritage.|$|E

The claim was bogus and Bratolyubov was arrested for fraud, but Rasputin intervened and he was released.

500|$|Several of {{the lines}} in the episode proved {{difficult}} for both fans and cast members to embrace. Fans did not readily accept that The Smoking Man was Mulder's father. Davis, who portrayed The Smoking Man, noted that fans {{did not believe the}} revelation because [...] "part of the mystique of it was that <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> their own idea of what was going on." [...] The dialogue in the episode proved difficult for Anderson to present believably. She was troubled that her character was arguing against the existence of extraterrestrials, when in the previous episode her character had encountered an alien shipwreck. When she talked to Carter, she said that she did not [...] "know if [...] do this anymore" [...] because her character was arguing against information that had been confirmed in the first two parts of the episode. Carter explained that there must be conflict between Mulder and Scully for the show's [...] "believer versus skeptic" [...] dynamic to work properly.|$|E
500|$|Drums on [...] "Satan's Bed" [...] were {{performed}} by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On {{the day it}} was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. <b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out." ...|$|E

500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here.

500|$|Tarkovsky cast Anatoli Solonitsyn for {{the role}} of Andrei Rublev. At this time Solonitsyn was an unknown actor at a theater in Sverdlovsk. According to Tarkovsky <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> a {{different}} image of the historical figure of Andrei Rublev, thus casting an unknown actor who would not remind viewers of other roles was his favoured approach. Solonitsyn, who had read the film script in the film magazine Iskusstvo Kino, was very enthusiastic about the role, traveled to Moscow at his own expense to meet Tarkovsky and even declared that no one could play this role better than him. Tarkovsky felt the same, saying that [...] "with Solonitsyn I simply got lucky". For the role of Andrei Rublev he required [...] "a face with great expressive power in which one could see a demoniacal single-mindedness". To Tarkovsky, Solonitsyn provided the right physical appearance and the talent of showing complex psychological processes. Solonitsyn would continue to work with the director, appearing in Solaris, The Mirror, and Stalker, and in the title role of Tarkovsky's 1976 stage production of Hamlet in Moscow's Lenkom Theatre. Before his death from cancer in 1982, Solonitsyn was also intended to play protagonist Andrei Gortchakov in Tarkovsky's 1983 Italian-Russian co-production Nostalghia, and to star in a project titled The Witch which Tarkovsky would significantly alter into his final production, The Sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|After the result's announcement, President Josipović {{commented that}} the day was of great {{significance}} to Croatia, defining the nation as one with a European future. Prime Minister Milanović welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; {{he also said that}} the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia. Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris Šprem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning. The Croatian Minister of the Economy, Radimir Čačić, concluded that Croatia's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed. He also stated that, since the referendum passed, it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating. Minister of Finance Slavko Linić stated that he was pleased with the result, but not with the voter turnout. He disagreed with Čačić that the credit rating could be saved by this result, since <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> already counted on Croatian entry to the EU. Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusić {{commented that the}} result was good news for Europe, which faced internal problems. Former Speaker Vladimir Šeks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors– the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions. Luka Bebić, also a former speaker of the Parliament, added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU. Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandroković commented that the result is especially important for the nation's youth, and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesić stated that Croatia should be competitive and use EU funds, adding that {{it is not enough to}} be happy with entering the EU. He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia, saying that [...] "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".|$|E
