5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by {{a change in the}} width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

25|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, physical design <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{in the standard}} design cycle which follows after the circuit design. At this step, circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) of the design are converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, will ensure the required functioning of the components. This geometric representation is called {{integrated circuit}} layout. This step is usually split into several sub-steps, which include both design and verification and validation of the layout.|$|E

25|$|The loaded {{synaptic}} vesicles must dock near release sites, however docking <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> of {{the cycle}} that we know little about. Many proteins on synaptic vesicles and at release sites have been identified, however none of the identified protein interactions between the vesicle proteins and release site proteins can account for the docking phase {{of the cycle}}. Mutants in rab-3 and unc-18 alter vesicle docking or vesicle organization at release sites, {{but they do not}} completely disrupt docking. SNARE proteins, {{do not appear to be}} involved in the docking step of the cycle.|$|E
25|$|This passive {{learning}} type is {{also the}} most common scheme in supervised learning: a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed, without the ability to query the label of unlabelled examples. Outputting a hypothesis h <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> of induction. Classically, an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase: the model parameters are estimated in the training phase, and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase. In the asymptotic limit of the number of applications, this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources.|$|E
25|$|Pratyahara is {{fetching}} {{and bringing}} near one's awareness and one's thoughts to within. It {{is a process}} of withdrawing one's thoughts from external objects, things, person, situation. It is turning one's attention to one's true Self, one's inner world, experiencing and examining self. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> of self extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is not consciously closing one's eyes to the sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom innate in one's inner world.|$|E

25|$|Webern's {{first piece}} after {{completing}} his studies with Schoenberg was the Passacaglia for orchestra (1908). Harmonically, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward {{into a more}} advanced language, and the orchestration is somewhat more distinctive than his earlier orchestral work. However, it bears little relation to the fully mature works he {{is best known for}} today. One element that is typical is the form itself: the passacaglia is a form which dates back to the 17th century, and a distinguishing feature of Webern's later work was to be the use of traditional compositional techniques (especially canons) and forms (the Symphony, the Concerto, the String Trio, and String Quartet, and the piano and orchestral Variations) in a modern harmonic and melodic language.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|The current Church now {{occupies}} {{what used}} to be the choir and the sanctuary areas. This is separated from the open court by a solid red brick wall, of Middle Ages construction with doors and windows. The original sanctuary was built in a trefoil style with three apses. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> higher than the nave in the open court. The rectangular space defined by the apses to its north, south, and east sides; used to serve as the altar for the greater basilica. Now the altar is located within the central or eastern apse. The rest of the space is now integrated into the nave of the current Church. There is also a new iconstasis made with solid wood and adorned by small icons on its top register. The current sanctuary in the central apse is actually divided into three. The middle one is dedicated to Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, the southern one to the Virgin Mary, and the northern one to Saint George.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E
25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in this direction.|$|E

Witmer claims that communal hunting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the evolution of cooperative hunting.
