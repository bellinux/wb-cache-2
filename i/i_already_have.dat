It features {{the names of}} LGBT and other minority communities, which {{was due to the}} support Gaga had received from the community over the years. She also explained that since The Fame and The Fame Monster did not directly address those communities, [...] "Born This Way" [...] was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs, but also empowered her to artistically say, [...] "'I'm not being safe with this record.'

The couple married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun's family, reportedly because they felt Anggun was too young [...] Georgea later became Anggun's manager. The following year, Anggun became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records, and took complete creative control over her work. She produced her final Indonesian studio album, Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!! (1993), which yielded number-one single [...] "Kembalilah Kasih (Kita Harus Bicara)". By age nineteen, Anggun had sold over four million albums in Indonesia. She began to feel dissatisfied with her success in her country and began considering an international music career. Anggun later recalled: [...] " [...] I was 20, I'd made five albums. I'd built my own record company. I'd produced my last album and produced some Indonesian acts as well. And I said to myself: 'I'm tired! I cannot achieve more than <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>have.</b> There's no challenge anymore'." ...|$|E

Lavigne stated that the album would musically be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby, with a release date rumoured for sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It's really different and a lot of my friends I've played it for really like it. I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E

500|$|The third single {{from the}} album, [...] "One Thing", is an upbeat pop rock song. The song has a [...] "plucky" [...] guitar riff and a [...] "forceful" [...] chorus with Lewis Corner of Digital Spy dubbing it [...] "arena-ready". The song's melody {{has been noted}} for {{similarities}} between Backstreet Boys song [...] "I Want It That Way". The fourth song on the album and fourth single, [...] "More than This", is a pop ballad. [...] "More than This" [...] contains sounds of synthesizers. The fifth song on the album, title track [...] "Up All Night", is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song. Lyrically, the song is a party-anthem, with the Katy Perry name-check in the chorus being noted by various publications. The sixth cut, [...] "I Wish", is a mid-tempo pop ballad. The song's lyrical tone {{has been compared to}} Robyn's [...] "Dancing On My Own". The seventh song, [...] "Tell Me a Lie", is an uptempo pop rock song which features prominent guitar instrumentation and pulsating beats. The song was originally intended for Kelly Clarkson's album Stronger (2011). [...] Clarkson spoke to Capital FM on how she was proud of the end result. [...] "It's a really cute song, I love it. I loved that they liked it. They sound really great on it. <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> it – I'm so VIP with my copy on my computer! It does sound really good." ...|$|E

Despite this, Hill won by 115pts with a season's best 6,669. Theisen-Eaton was disappointed with her silver medal saying [...] "I'm disappointed. I went in as the favourite and I didn't compete how I had to to win gold. And that was my own fault.

2500|$|The vogue for {{portrait}} drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she {{may have}} regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family photograph album. Catherine loved having her children painted: [...] "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, [...] "to have paintings of all the children done [...] [...] [...] and sent to me, without delay, {{as soon as they}} are finished". However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally. On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of François Clouet and requesting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. Catherine gave detailed instructions: [...] "I pray you do me the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great , and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> one in full face, {{it would be better to}} have her turning to the right." ...|$|E
