South Korea has already put this technology into practice in city of Songdo, where traffic, waste and energy usage are monitored [140].

40|$|Accelerated {{atherosclerosis}} {{leading to}} {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and other cardiac manifestations <b>have</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>importance</b> for the management and outcome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is increased cardiovascular mortality in SLE. Several traditional and disease-related risk factors, as well as corticosteroids are involved in lupus-associated atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations. Cardiovascular risk is even higher in lupus patients also having secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) due to the additive effects of SLE- and APS-related risk factors. The primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis and CAD in these diseases includes drug treatment, {{such as the use}} of statins and aspirin, as well as lifestyle modifications. Apart from CAD, other cardiac manifestations may also be present in SLE patients. Among these conditions, pericarditis is the most common, however, myocarditis, endocarditis and valvular disease, conduction abnormalities, impairment of systolic and diastolic function, pulmonary or peripheral arterial hypertension and microcirculatory problems may also occur. Early diagnosis of SLE, active immunosuppressive treatment and close follow-up of lupus patients and prevention may help to minimize cardiovascular risk in these individuals. Lupus (2006) 15, 3 – 10.

40|$|EP 1132460 A UPAB: 20011119 NOVELTY - A {{disposable}} bioreactor for cultivating cells used in immuno therapy, comprising a substrate-carrying {{organic material}} {{located in a}} pouch, is new. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Disposable bioreactor for cultivating cells comprises a substrate-carrying organic material located in a pouch. The substrate (16) carries the organic material and is permeable to the organic culture medium. The substrate is placed between and surrounded by two planar sections (12, 14), forming a pouch-like structure. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the method of cultivating organic matter, especially dendritic cells. USE - As a bioreactor for cultivating organic matter, especially dendritic cells. These are expected to <b>have</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>importance</b> in immuno-therapy directed against tumor cells. ADVANTAGE - Cultivation of dendritic cells is improved, the apparatus described making cultivation simple and reliable. The pouch-like reactor vessel is particularly easy to handle. Introduction into, and removal from the incubator is facilitated. The apparatus is very low in cost, suiting it for disposable use. The pouch can be impermeable, or permeable to nutrients. Its contents may reinforce it, making it stable in form and dimensions...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} new {{dimensions of}} Information System evaluation. Sustainability issues <b>have</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>importance</b> and their influence is {{compared with the}} Internet revolution. Customers, policymakers and business partners increasingly require the monitoring and reporting {{of the impact of}} an organisation on sustainability. However, traditional IS evaluation approaches are not able to capture the impact of IT/IS on sustainability, especially in relation to social and environmental dimensions. In order to stimulate discussion and research, the authors propose a framework that was originally developed to focus on supply chain issues. The framework is built upon three dimensions: economic, social and environmental, which are divided further into three sub-dimensions. It was created to evaluate supply chain practices, but it {{can be used as a}} staring point to develop a framework for sustainability-oriented IS evaluation. In the paper the sustainability drivers are presented, and the problems related to IT/IS evaluation are discussed using selected examples from IT/IS applications in supply chain management. IT/IS solutions used in supply chains are perceived as having both positive and negative effects on sustainability. Moreover some business models supported by IT/IS that are perceived as positive for the supply chain processes, could be considered negativ...|$|E

Agriculture households in South Serbia fall into the category of regions with difficult conditions for agriculture such as the lack of connection between the new technologies and users, low population density, small plots, lack of information, difficult access to counselling services, low level of initiatives and the absence of local administrative capacity and technical assistance in agricultural production.
