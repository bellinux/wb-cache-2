5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form anywhere {{within the}} extratropical {{regions of the}} Earth (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator), either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form <b>each</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends <b>each</b> <b>winter</b> in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E
5|$|James of Saint George, {{a famous}} {{architect}} and engineer from Savoy, was probably {{responsible for the}} bulk of the construction work across the region. The castles were extremely costly to build and required labourers, masons, carpenters, diggers, and building resources to be gathered by local sheriffs from across England, mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home <b>each</b> <b>winter.</b> The number of workers involved placed a significant drain on the country's national labour force. The total financial cost cannot be calculated with certainty, but estimates suggest that Edward's castle building programme cost at least £80,000 – four times the total royal expenditure on castles between 1154 and 1189.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) <b>each</b> <b>winter.</b> The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. <b>Each</b> <b>winter</b> they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home <b>each</b> <b>winter.</b> The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up <b>each</b> <b>winter</b> when the Gulf of Finland froze. Bronenosets was {{reclassified}} as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34, Barzha No. 51 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 324. The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf of Finland sometime during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up <b>each</b> <b>winter</b> when the Gulf of Finland froze. Edinorog was {{reclassified}} as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. The ship was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 4 on 10 July of that year. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns. The ship was redesignated as Blokshiv No. 2 on 1 January 1932 and survived World War II to be renamed BSh-2 on 16 May 1949. She was stricken on 27 June 1957 and turned over to the Kronstadt Yacht Club. Her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up <b>each</b> <b>winter</b> when the Gulf of Finland froze. On 18 July 1875, she was accidentally rammed by the ironclad , but only {{suffered}} minor damage. Perun was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. After she was stricken she was used as a pilot ship before being renamed Lotsiia (Pilot) in 1915. During the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, the ship was struck by artillery fire. She was laid up after the resulting fire badly damaged her. During a flood on 23 September 1924, Lotsiia ran aground and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Vamei {{developed}} in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of Borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography. Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and {{in an analysis of}} 51winters, only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665km (415mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days <b>each</b> <b>winter.</b> The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400years.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was {{assigned}} to the newly formed Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870 and she was laid up <b>each</b> <b>winter</b> when the Gulf of Finland froze. Lava was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. The ship was used as a floating barracks by the Third Destroyer Division from 1902 to 1908 and was then used as an observation post during gunnery training. Lava was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 1 on 14 April of that year. She was converted into a floating hospital in 1916 and may have received her old name at that time. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was supposedly broken up there around that time, but may have still been in existence in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed {{for at least four}} months <b>each</b> <b>winter).</b> The first state highway bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first bond issue.|$|E
