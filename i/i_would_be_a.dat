5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In Nyasaland, the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the economic pressures on Africans in Nyasaland. Millenarians at the time believed that World War <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states.|$|E

We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E

500|$|When he was eighteen, Littleton {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan to study physics. His choice of major was influenced by his father, who wanted one of his children to follow him in his profession (Littleton’s oldest sibling Martha was an industrial psychologist; his oldest brother Jesse chose medicine as a career; and his brother Joe became a Vice President of Corning’s Technical Products Division). According to Littleton, [...] "I always thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> physicist like my father".|$|E

500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right then that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E
500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual." [...] Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, [...] "Let's face it, I am 73 years old. Does that answer your question about whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dangerous homosexual?" ...|$|E

[...] After becoming the most subscribed user, Ben Donovan of Maker Studios stated that PewDiePie [...] "is a great example of how a YouTube content creator can amass a worldwide following due to passion and creativity, and his large subscriber base showcases the loyalty and strong connection he has to his 'bros.'" [...] On 1 November, PewDiePie became the first channel to reach 15 million subscribers; the following day, the channel was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight account {{at the top of the}} site's subscriber rankings. In the same month, PewDiePie proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system. In December, PewDiePie overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel to once again become the most subscribed user on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|Official film {{adaptations of}} Matheson's novel {{appeared}} in 1964 as The Last Man on Earth, in 1971 as The Omega Man, and the 2007 release I Am Legend. Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, feeling that [...] "It was ... kind of cornball", though he later said, [...] "George Romero's a nice guy, though. I don't harbor any animosity toward him." [...] Critic Danél Griffin remarked, [...] "Romero freely admits that his film {{was a direct}} rip-off of Matheson's novel; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little less harsh in my description and say that Romero merely expanded the author's ideas with deviations so completely original that [...] is expelled from being labeled a true 'rip-off'".|$|E

[...] He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on The Charlie Rose Show, Rose asked, [...] "The guiding light has always been Henry James?" [...] and Banville replied, [...] "I think so, I mean people say, you know, I've been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it's always been Henry James [...] so I would follow him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Jamesian." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the Butcher family in May 1988 {{signified}} an {{end of an era}} for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson) vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over tenancy. Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane, played by Sophie Lawrence, Frank's teenage children came with Frank. Lawrence was 15 at the time, and she got the part in EastEnders straight after leaving stage school. Lawrence has commented, [...] "I always just thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dancer and go into a West End musical and that I would be very, very happy.

2500|$|More popular was Delightful Dalmatia (1914), {{an account}} of {{traveling}} with John Oliver Moqué in Dalmatia prior to the first World War. Alice explains that Dalmatia is their ninth [...] "wedding tour," [...] since they take one [...] "every year". She writes of Dalmatian women: [...] "I'm so glad I wasn't born a Dalmatian – or I feel sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bomb-throwing, acid-pouring, Croatian suffragette!" [...] Although she portrays herself as somewhat flighty, her descriptions of Dalmatia are careful, detailed, and knowledgeable. That she describes Dalmatia {{just prior to the}} first World War adds extra interest to her account. The book is illustrated throughout with her photographs, in spite of military prohibitions against taking pictures in many of the places they visited. It [...] "had a great success as one of the war books of the year".|$|E
2500|$|Morath {{was briefly}} {{married to the}} British {{journalist}} Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph {{during a visit to}} Venice. [...] "It was instantly clear to me that from now on <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> photographer", she wrote. [...] "As I continued to photograph I became quite joyous. I knew that I could express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found my language in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E
2500|$|Arturo Toscanini, a {{prominent}} anti-fascist, was furious {{to learn that}} Furtwängler {{would be at the}} Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler's actions. Toscanini argued: [...] "I know quite well that you are {{not a member of the}} Party. I am also aware that you have helped your Jewish friends [...] But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!". Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: [...] "By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which happens to be in power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events." [...] Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.|$|E
