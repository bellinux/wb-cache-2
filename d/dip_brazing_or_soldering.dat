It may also be caused by electroplated surfaces or metal-rich anti-corrosion paint, such as cadmium passivated steel or zinc chromate primer on aluminium aircraft parts.

50|$|Junctions {{should be}} made in a {{reliable}} manner, {{but there are many}} possible approaches to accomplish this.For low temperatures, junctions can be <b>brazed</b> <b>or</b> <b>soldered,</b> however {{it may be difficult to}} find a suitable flux and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the solder's low melting point.Reference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with screw terminal blocks.For high temperatures, a common approach is a spot weld or crimp using a durable material.A common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added emfs.This may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.|$|R

40|$|Aluminum Silicon Carbide (AlSiC) {{metal matrix}} {{composite}} (MMC) materials have {{a unique set of}} material properties that are ideally suited for all electronic packaging applications requiring thermal management. The AlSiC coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) value is compatible with direct IC device attachment for the maximum thermal dissipation through the 170 – 200 W/mK thermal conductivity value material. Additionally, the low material density of AlSiC makes it ideal for weight sensitive applications such as portable devices. The AlSiC material and functional electronic packaging geometries are produced using the Ceramics Process Systems Corporation's QuickSet™/QuickCast ™ net-shape (without machining) fabrication process. Additionally, functional packaging features such as feedthrus, sealrings and substrates are incorporated in AlSiC during fabrication using the CPS Concurrent Integration ™ technique eliminating the need for the traditional assembly and <b>brazing</b> (<b>or</b> <b>soldering)</b> operations. The ideal AlSiC material properties and the AlSiC net-shape fabrication process provides low-cost high performance functional thermal management packaging solutions. This paper will review the material properties of AlSiC contrasted to traditional heat-sinking materials. AlSiC fabrication processing flow will also be reviewed and discussed. Functional packaging designs and application solutions will be illustrated through CPS AlSiC product examples...|$|R
40|$|Hamilton Sundstrand (HS), {{together}} with NASA Johnson Space Center, developed methods to metallurgically join graphite fiber to aluminum. The {{goal of the}} effort was to demonstrate improved thermal conductance, tensile strength and manufacturability compared to existing epoxy bonded techniques. These improvements {{have the potential to}} increase the performance and robustness of phase change material heat sinks that use graphite fibers as an interstitial material. Initial work focused on evaluating joining techniques from 4 suppliers, each consisting of a metallization step followed by <b>brazing</b> <b>or</b> <b>soldering</b> of one inch square blocks of Fibercore graphite fiber material to aluminum end sheets. Results matched the strength and thermal conductance of the epoxy bonded control samples, so two suppliers were down-selected for a second round of braze development. The second round of braze samples had up to a 300 % increase in strength and up to a 132 % increase in thermal conductance over the bonded samples. However, scalability and repeatability proved to be significant hurdles with the metallization approach. An alternative approach was pursued which used nickel and active braze allows to prepare the carbon fibers for joining with aluminum. This approach was repeatable and scalable with improved strength and thermal conductance when compared with epoxy bonding...|$|R
40|$|In modern joining technology, {{the focus}} is on {{effective}} brazing and soldering of temperature sensitive materials. Here, as well as in diffusion welding processes the needed thermal energy is externally realized in the joint zone. This produces a heating of the whole joining parts, since in laminar joining the thermal energy is transported in interior by thermal conduction. An excess of critical temperatures or tolerable impact periods in wide parts of materials and respectively components is often not avoidable. This leads to thermal damages. In this point of view nanotechnology shows promising possibilities as scale effects and their resulting thermophysical effects such as melting temperature reduction and high diffusion rates can be used for providing a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis at room temperature. After ignition by an external energy source a self-propagating exothermic reaction is started. By producing a multilayer system with alternately arranged nanoscaled layers of e. g. Al and Ni the resulting thin foil can be used as heat source for melting the <b>braze</b> <b>or</b> <b>solder</b> material within the joining zone without any external preheating. Due to the high process velocities up to 30 m/s and the local heat input significant thermal influences on the joined parts are not detectable...|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently <b>brazed</b> <b>or</b> <b>soldered</b> to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and <b>soldered,</b> <b>or</b> flanged and <b>brazed</b> (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the <b>soldering,</b> <b>brazing</b> <b>or</b> welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
50|$|Monel metal is an alloy of {{approximately}} two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It {{is similar to}} platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the New York City Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be <b>brazed,</b> welded, <b>or</b> <b>soldered</b> in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.|$|R

Originally penannular, the ring is composed of seven separate strands of circular-sectioned gold wire which have each been joined along their length to create a ribbed band. Analysis by SEM-EDX suggests that the wire has been made by hammering wire with a quadrangular cross-section into a more rounded shape, and that the individual strands have been joined by using a <b>brazing</b> alloy <b>or</b> hard <b>solder.</b> Although only the second example found from Scotland, the ring is related to a class of composite gold rings of Middle to Late Bronze Age date known form the British Isles, Ireland and France...|$|R
40|$|The {{front end}} beamline section {{contains}} photon shutters and fixed masks. These components {{are made of}} OFHC copper and GlidCOP AL- 15. Stainless steels (304 or 316) are also used for connecting photon shutters and fixed masks to other components that operate in the ultrahigh vacuum system. All these dissimilar materials need to be joined together. However, bonding these dissimilar materials is very difficult because of their different mechanical and thermal properties and incompatible metallurgical properties. Explosion bonding is a bonding method in which the controlled energy of a detonating explosive is {{used to create a}} metallurgical bond between two or more similar or dissimilar materials. No intermediate filler metal, for example, a <b>brazing</b> compound <b>or</b> <b>soldering</b> alloy, is needed to promote bonding, and no external heat need be applied. A study of the metallurgical and mechanical properties and YGV applications of GlidCop AL- 15, OFHC copper, and 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded joints has been done. This report contains five parts: an ultrasonic examination of explosion-bonded joints and a standard setup; mechanical-property and thermal-cycle tests of GlidCop AL- 15 / 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded joints; leak tests of a GlidCop AL- 15 / 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded interfaces for UHV application; metallurgical examination of explosion-bonded interfaces and failure analysis, and discussion and conclusion...|$|R

This containment is under vacuum and this pressure is monitored along with the freon pressure to determine freon leakage so that necessary steps can be taken to stop contamination of the spacelab air.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews a new, {{low-temperature}} {{process for}} soldering and brazing ceramics to metals {{that is based}} on the use of reactive multilayer foils as a local heat source. The reactive foils range in thickness from 40 µm to 100 µm and contain many nanoscale layers that alternate between materials with large heats of mixing, such as Al and Ni. By inserting a free-standing foil between two <b>solder</b> (<b>or</b> <b>braze)</b> layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction of the foil melts the <b>solder</b> (<b>or</b> <b>braze)</b> and consequently bonds the components. The use of reactive foils eliminates the need for a furnace, and dramatically reduces the heating of the components being bonded. Thus ceramics and metals can be joined over large areas without the damaging thermal stresses that are typically encountered when cooling in furnace <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> operations. This paper draws on earlier work to review the bonding process and its application to a variety of ceramic-metal systems. Predictions of thermal profiles during bonding and the resulting residual stresses are described and compared with results for conventional <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> processes. The microstructure, uniformity, and physical properties of the reactive foil bonds are reviewed as well, using several different ceramic-metal systems as examples...|$|R

5000|$|Apparently {{the metal}} workers of ancient Igbo-Ukwu {{were not aware}} of {{commonly}} used techniques such as wire making, <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> riveting which suggests an independent development and long isolation of their metal working tradition. It is therefore perplexing {{that they were able to}} create objects with such fine surface detail that they depict, for example small insects which seem to have landed on the surface. Though these appear to have been riveted <b>or</b> <b>soldered</b> on to the artifacts, they were actually cast in one piece. The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art describes them as being [...] "among the most inventive and technically accomplished bronzes ever made." [...] Although the lost wax casting process was used to produce the bronzes, latex was probably used in Igbo-Ukwu instead of beeswax which would explain how the artists were able to produce such fine and filigrann surface detail. Some of the techniques used by the ancient smiths are not known to have been used outside Igbo-Ukwu such as the production of complex objects in stages with the different parts later fixed together by <b>brazing</b> <b>or</b> by casting linking sections to join them. However the complexity of some of the Igbo-Ukwu objects has led to considerable altercation between various metallurgic experts and debates regarding the actual production process which is an affidavit for the highly developed and intricate work of the ancient artists.|$|R

40|$|In the tropics, {{termites}} {{are major}} pests of buildings such as offices and stores. Buildings of traditional construction {{may have to}} be replaced every 3 - 9 years; grain stores may need replacing annually. Entire villages have had to be relocated because of termite infestation. Even modern concrete and brick buildings are not immune, since termite damage to door and window frames and wooden rafters can require costly repairs. In the past, highly toxic compounds such as copper aceto-arsenite (Paris green) or sodium arsenite were used to protect buildings against termites. They were replaced in the 1940 s by organochlorine insecticides such as aldrin, dieldrin and chlordane. Concern over environmental damage caused by these insecticides led to their being banned or withdrawn from use in many countries. They were replaced by insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, oftanol, permethrin and cypermethrin. However, these materials are too costly for widespread use in many ACP countries where low cost, locally available solutions are needed. Most termite damage to buildings is caused by subterranean termites which live under, or near, buildings which they enter through cracks or by constructing soil runways over the footings and lower wall. From there, they move throughout the building either within the walls, or under soil runways on walls. The most effective method of control is to create a barrier between the building and the soil. This is most easily accomplished during construction and is more readily achieved in concrete and brick buildings than in traditional structures. Whatever the type of building, however, all potentially termite-attracting wood debris, including tree stumps and roots, should be removed from the site before construction begins. A concrete base provides an effective barrier to termites entering through the floor of a structure. It should be cast as a single slab on ground which has been well compacted to avoid subsidence and cracking of the base. Holes around services (pipes and cables) which pass through the slab should be sealed with a pitch-based sealing compound. Termites then need to construct soil tubes on the outside if they are {{to gain access to the}} building. If the base of the wall is kept clear of plants and debris and painted white, termite runways will be easily seen. They can be cleaned off to prevent termites becoming established inside the building. This treatment can tee very effective if carried out regularly. Termite shields fitted on top of the foundations, sleeper walls or piers also prevent termite access. The most effective shields consists of a continuous strip of copper, aluminium or galvanised iron around the building beneath the entire thickness of the wall and extending out from the building for 50 mm then bent downwards at 450 for 50 mm (Fig la). All joints should be double locked and <b>brazed</b> <b>or</b> <b>soldered.</b> A simpler shield consists of a cement sill around the building, preferably with a groove cut into the underside (Fig 1 b). Shields should be at least 180 mm above the ground and should be inspected regularly for damage. Buildings of traditional construction are more difficult to protect. Many have a framework of wooden poles driven into the ground, which is then covered in mud or clay. Termites tunnel through the wood, wee ken the walls and destroy the structure. Walls made solely of mud may not attract termites, but the addition of straw to mud can encourage termites to tunnel into walls. Termites also tunnel through walls or construct soil tubes over them to attack the rafters and thatch. Wherever possible, termite-resistant wood should be used in construction. Several locally available materials are said to protect wood against termites. These include wood ash placed in post holes. Poles can also be treated by burning or charring the outer wood of the pole or painting it with used engine oil or creosote. Engine oil mixed into the soil along the base of the walls may also protect them. Some plant extracts (e. g. sap of Calotropis spp.) can protect timber for several months. Traditional grain and food stores may also be attacked. Some stores are more susceptible than others. Stores are built on top of 2 m high slabs of rock in India to protect them against termites. In Zimbabwe, a base of resistant timber pro sects the store, while in Ethiopia the termite susceptible stilts below the stores are replaced annually. Oversized termite caps (Fig 2) on the legs of stores also protect the contents against rats and mice. We know that termite damage to traditional and modern buildings can be reduced or controlled without the use of in ported pesticides; further research would help to test and improve these alternative methods of control. Further work is being undertaken by the Natural Resources Institute (NRI).
