5|$|Ahmed Best as <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised movements to make <b>Jar</b> <b>Jar</b> look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E

5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden <b>jar,</b> invented in 1746. The Leyden <b>jar</b> stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden <b>jar</b> is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction. They both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E
50|$|Variations in the {{practices}} of cremation inside <b>jars</b> and secondary burial outside <b>jars,</b> as noted by Colani, have proven difficult to explain. The cremated remains seem to mainly belong to adolescents. While the bomb clearance operations did not involve emptying of <b>jars</b> and thus no additional evidence could be gathered, Van Den Bergh claimed that the stone <b>jars</b> initially {{may have been used}} to distil the dead bodies and that the cremated remains within the <b>jars</b> represent the most recent phase in Plain of <b>Jars.</b> The <b>jars</b> with smaller apertures may reflect the diminishing need to place an entire body inside.|$|R

50|$|Cookie <b>jars,</b> {{also known}} as biscuit barrels or <b>jars,</b> {{have been used in}} England since {{the latter part of the}} 18th century. They were often made of glass with metal lids. Cookie <b>jars</b> became popular in America around the time of the Great Depression in 1929. Early American cookie <b>jars</b> were made of glass with metal {{screw-on}} lids. In the 1930s, stoneware became predominant as the material for American cookie <b>jars.</b> Early cookie <b>jars</b> typically have simple cylindrical shapes and were often painted with floral or leaf decorations or emblazoned with colorful decals.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled <b>jar</b> baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the <b>jar</b> {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E

5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the <b>jar</b> and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the <b>jar</b> was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E

A new section from <b>Jar</b> to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from <b>Jar</b> to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the replacement of stock with wide suburban standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all the streetcar companies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a {{sandwich}} {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with the contents of one <b>jar</b> of creamy peanut butter, one <b>jar</b> of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley {{is the source of}} its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E

5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a <b>jar</b> is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent <b>jar</b> exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E

The <b>jars</b> are stone sarcophagi dating from the early Iron Age (500BCE to 800CE) and contained evidence of human remains, burial goods and ceramics. Some sites contain more than 250 individual <b>jars.</b> The tallest <b>jars</b> are more than 3 meters in height. Little is known about the megalithic culture which produced the <b>jars,</b> but the <b>jars</b> and prevalence of iron ore in the region suggest that people who created the site grew wealthy from overland trade routes.|$|R

5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked <b>jar,</b> and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape <b>jar</b> with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E

Many sets of <b>jars</b> survive from this period, in alabaster, aragonite, calcareous stone, and blue or green glazed porcelain. The sons of Horus were also the gods of the cardinal compass points.
