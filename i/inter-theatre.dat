50|$|The {{mission of}} the 142d Airlift Squadron is to provide combat ready aircrew for state, {{national}} and worldwide deployment in support of any assigned mission. The squadron's mission capability includes all weather, day and night, airland, airdrop and aeromedical evacuation capability. The C-130 aircraft is capable to perform both <b>inter-theatre</b> and intra-theatre missions. The squadron is can also supply specially trained aircrews for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations when called upon. The squadron has pilots, navigators, flight engineers and loadmasters, life support, and administrative personnel assigned.|$|E
40|$|The DARPA SLS Program is {{developing}} a technology that has been justified, at least in part, by its potential relevance to military applications. In an effort o demonstrate the relevance of SIS technology to real-world military applications, BBN has undertaken the task of providing aspoken language interface to DART, a system for military logistical transportation planning. We discuss the transportation planning process, describe the real-world DART system, identify parts of the system where spoken language can facilitate planning, and describe BBN's work towards porting the HARC SIS system to the DART domain. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING Logistical transportation planning {{is the process of}} determining how to get people and cargo from where they are to where they need to be. <b>Inter-theatre</b> movements of personnel and supplies around the world are currently planned for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and other services by USTRANSCOM (the US TRANSportation COMmand) which operates under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The transportation plarming process is quite complex, involving very large databases of movement requirements, and information about personnel, cargo, transportation assets, and geographic locations. Currently, the human interface to military planning systems is relatively enmbersome and unintelligent, which adds extra complexity to the planner's task. As a domain for the application of spoken language, military transportation planning has a number of advantages: 1. Transportation planning is an essential military function and successful application of spoken language would be both useful to TRANSCOM and visible to other potential military users of SLS technology. 2. The concept of planning movements ofpeople and supplies can be understood by a wide audience. 3. The application isnon-trivial and, in the DART context that we will describe, affords opportunities for applying spoken language understanding at many levels of sophistication. 4. Current efforts to improve the planning process using non-speech technology have been weU-received, and cooperative users may be available as close as Scott Air Force Base nea...|$|E
