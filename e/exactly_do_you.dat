The panel and audience members, all enthusiastic alumni and students of my alma mater’s English Department, were discussing the career paths they had (or had not) chosen since college graduation.

Despite our diverse backgrounds and at times contentious conversation, we left that conference room having agreed on at least one thing: successful professionals are exceptional analysts.

I had remarked that knowing how to analyze hinges on not only being able to build arguments, but also on being able to break them down.

40|$|When {{trying to}} {{envision}} a happy day, or a happy life, what images come to mind? For some people, {{it might be}} sharing a meal with good {{friends and family members}} while laughing together, telling stories, and feeling loved. For others, happiness may come from accomplishing an important goal and basking in the glory of a job well done. And for others still, happiness may be the byproduct of doing good deeds, helping others, and believing that the world is a better place because of it. Although people may vary a good deal in what they think will make them happy, an overwhelming majority of U. S. residents place ‘‘finding happiness’ ’ very high on their list of major life goals (Diener, Suh, Smith, & Shao, 1995). How <b>exactly</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ‘‘find happiness?’ ’ This question has been posed for thousands of years, and although many self-help books have attempted to offer answers, their authors have often based their conclusions, however well meaning, on their own personal, idiosyncratic experiences. Only recently has scientific evidence emerged to suggest a possible path to lasting happiness that is effective for the majority of people. By scientific, we mean that researchers have conducted rigorous experiments to determine whether particular strategies for increasing happiness actually work. The present chapter reviews this evidence and provides practical suggestions that you can use to create long-term, or sustainable, changes in your level of well-being. IS HAPPINESS A WORTHWHILE GOAL?

40|$|Domesticating and {{cultivating}} {{fruit trees}} Cue: You {{would think that}} if something is special it is safe. But with indigenous or local fruit trees {{that is not the}} case. Trees that have been used and enjoyed by our people for generations are at risk. Some are dying out. Ferdinand Mushinge is the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. He encourages us to identify our favorites and to domesticate these wild trees by raising on our farms. A collection of fruit tree varieties ? and all their characteristics ? is a gene bank where the diversity is preserved. As he explained to Chris Kakunta, the trees on your land need to be nurtured just as tenderly as any other crop, or foreign, exotic trees. If not, then they will not thrive and the genetic treasure they hold could be lost forever. IN:	?We have been involved? OUT:	? they will have a regular harvest. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: The things you will need to get the best from your domesticated fruit trees were explained to Chris Kakunta by Ferdinand Mushinge, the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mushinge	We have been involved in indigenous fruit trees because some were being heavily harvested for firewood. So genetic erosion was slowly creeping in. Future generation might not have such fruits in the future. So far I can say so good, these trees can be domesticated. That is what is initially required is, farmers can set up what we call community seed banks. The seed can be collected, processed and then planted out in what we call small nurseries and then re-grown in strategic areas. But one thing you should know when you talk about domestication. The trees should be grown in their natural ecological sites. Kakunta	When you talk of ecological sites what <b>exactly</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean? Mushinge	What I am trying to say when I say ecological sites, tree species, can only establish properly, they only flower and fruit properly in particular geographical areas which are adapted to certain climatic conditions which are conducive for them to flower and fruit. Kakunta	If the farmers have to choose an indigenous tree which they can domesticate, what factors do they have to follow? Mushinge	The factors which farmers have to follow if they have to domesticate a particular indigenous fruit tree is one the climatic factor, two the rainfall pattern, three the species of that wild fruit tree. Soil conditions are also important. For example I will give you a very common fruit tree which is very vital in agriculture, you will find it commonly in the markets but unfortunately it is slowly phasing out, you find {{that a lot of the}} trees have been cut. The example I am talking about is Uapaca Kirkiana which is commonly known as masuku. Very nice, very tasty but can be successfully grown. Kakunta	Wonderful, so what about in terms of the period under which the farmer can grow the tree and be able to get the fruits, don?t you think it matters as well? Mushinge	That is a very important point. If you talk about such trees like mango which is exotic, mango normally will flower and fruit after 3 to 4 years. And from there one aspect you have to consider is biennial bearing. Sometimes the fruit might not be too well because of maybe climatic factors, if the rainfall has not dropped very well the fruit might not flower and fruit very well. But a point in fact is if it is properly cultivated, that is such factors like proper fertilisation in fact even irrigate in terms of scarce rainfall periods you can even put in some water. As a matter of fact when you plant out these trees like the masuku you only need to establish it in the first year. In the next years or so you let nature run its course. Kakunta	Could you just tell us some steps towards cultivation of this particular tree? Mushinge	One, what is most important is tillage. For example the trees, when you plant them out in the field they have to be 4 by 4 metres apart. Two, they have to irrigated at least once per week. When I say irrigate them, irrigate them once per week with 15 to 20 litres of water, make sure that you apply some fertiliser, that is X or D compound and then you really should be applying it once per year as and when the need arises. Kakunta	Now in the absence of these chemical fertilisers would you recommend farmers to use manure for instance? Mushinge	That is a very good question. Manure behaves like fertiliser. The most important aspect one should consider is that it should properly decompose. Make sure that it decomposes properly but it is an excellent alternative to inorganic fertilisers. Kakunta	So once the farmer follows this procedure are they assured that these indigenous fruit trees can grow just like the exotic ones? Mushinge	When these plants follow out the proper agronomic procedures which I have stipulated after 3, 4 and 5 years depending on the species in question they will definitely have a continuous yield but a point in fact is management is very important. Exotic fruit trees need to be managed same as indigenous fruit trees, they can be domesticated, managed and they will have a regular harvest.

40|$|Stopping slash-and-burn Cue: Slash-and-burn {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of agriculture, and in areas with low {{population}} density it can still be a sustainable way of survival. But forest land which has been cleared and cultivated needs a long time to recover; when population increases, recovery times for the land are reduced, and in time it becomes degraded and exhausted. However, changing the methods used by slash-and-burn cultivators is notoriously difficult. Many countries have found that sending in government extension officers to train in better methods simply does not work. Non-government organisations, however, have a better track record when it comes to working closely with communities. They often use a participative approach, helping people to work out their own solutions to their problems, rather than imposing solutions from the outside. One example is the Green Living Movement, an organisation which is working with the Lala people, slash-and-burn cultivators who live in a remote part of Zambia. In our next report, Emmanuel Mutamba of the Green Living Movement talks to Daniel Sikazwe about how the organisation is working with the Lala people to make their management of the forest more sustainable. IN:		?Basically the Lala people ?? OUT:		??can advise the people properly. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Emmanuel Mutamba hoping a better relationship between Zambia?s forest services and indigenous tribes in the future. Transcript Mutamba	Basically the Lala people in that area are getting most of their livelihoods from the forest, through the use of ?chitemene? which is a slash-and-burn system of agriculture, which has resurfaced after a while. During the beginning of the 1990 s, we saw the chitemene system coming back to life after the government policy changed towards agriculture. People were no longer able to get free inputs through government loans, so they reverted back to what was almost dying, the chitemene system. Now it is in full force and the threat on the forest is quite high. So this {{is one of the}} areas that we are really working towards, to help our communities start looking at sustainable management systems. Sikazwe	And these sustainable management systems, you work with the community. But then getting those people together requires some very good skills on your part. Just what are some of these specific methods that you are using to work with the community there? Mutamba	In this case we are looking at an area where people are cut off from the main areas of economic activity, so you have to really appreciate that their basic life-supporting system circles around the forest, or the natural resources. And while we are trying to help people manage their resources, we also realise that they have to use them. So we have to strike a balance at conservation and utilisation. So basically those are the systems that we are using. But we are going further. We are not just going there to train the people, we are going there to also learn about the difficulties that people are going through. Then when we start learning the difficulties that people are going through, we create a relationship, and once we create a relationship, we start understanding the intra-conflicts that exist in communities and natural resource management. You go there not as an expert, but as a partner with the people. So you give them what you have learned from school, but if it does not work, it does not work, so you revise what you have learned, you start thinking anew. Sikazwe	Can you give me an example of one method that you have had to re-do or rethink, as you have said, in the joint forest management? Mutamba	Well one of them is the thinking that the chitemene system, for instance, is bad. Just going there and saying, ?The chitemene system is bad! Stop!? is not the best approach. The best approach is that we start looking at why do we say the chitemene system is not sustainable. So we start looking at the issues like the population has increased; it means that we shall have more forest felled in a short period of time, because we are now many. The population has increased, it means that if we all go and attack the forest upstream, which means that the impact on the streams, our water, will be enormous. So you start looking at all these resultants of certain activities. So people start appreciating these issues. Sikazwe	Let me take you back a little. You talked about going to live with the community. What <b>exactly</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean? Mutamba	Basically what I mean there is you go and stay there, let?s say for a period of three months up to six months. Sikazwe	Do you have specific officers that do that? Mutamba	Yes we have got what we call field volunteers. Most of them have got some skills of some kind, we have had even qualified foresters staying with people in the villages. And they train them on new management systems. They also learn of what the indigenous people do to manage the forest. Then together they come up with workable programmes. Now when these volunteers, field volunteers, come out of the field, then they have quite a wealth of knowledge that they have learned themselves from their experiences. And in future we hope that if these people are sort of employed in the mainstream forest department, then we think that we will have people with the right attitudes who can advise the people properly.
