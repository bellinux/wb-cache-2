25|$|Some of the {{creature}}s of light (the Abbhasaras) who had curiosity and a greedy nature began to dive and taste the savory Earth's substance.

500|$|Howard R. Cohen {{learned from}} Charles B. Griffith {{that when the}} film was being edited, [...] "there was a point where two scenes would not cut together.

Chuck comes running up to me, says, 'You've got to see this!' It was a magazine article—eight pages on {{the symbolism of the}} moon in Little Shop of Horrors." [...] According to Corman, the total budget for the production was $30,000. Other sources estimate the budget to be between $22,000 and $100,000.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was a most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] {{always wanted to be}} this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E
500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the first}} plants were being {{imported}} to these major Western European gardens from Eastern Europe and nearby Asia (which provided many bulbs), and these {{found a place}} in the new gardens, where they could be conveniently studied by the plant experts of the day. For example, Asian introductions were described by Carolus Clusius (1526–1609), who was director, in turn, of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna and Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Many plants were being collected from the Near East, especially bulbous plants from Turkey. Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry, and he helped create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe at Leyden where his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate this garden near its original site. The [...] of Leyden in 1601 was a perfect square divided into quarters for the four continents, but by 1720, though, it was a rambling system of beds, struggling to contain the novelties rushing <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> became better known as the [...] His Exoticorum libri decem (1605) is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted today. The inclusion of new plant introductions in botanic gardens meant their scientific role was now widening, as botany gradually asserted its independence from medicine.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E
