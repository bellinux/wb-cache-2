Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier.

[...] "To this day, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> no idea how they made the album End of the Century, or who actually played bass on it." [...] Dee Dee's account contradicts much of the band's collective account from the 1982 Trouser Press interview, where the band stated that the only track that Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover of [...] "Baby, I Love You"; as the band, save for Joey, had gone home after cutting basic tracks {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E

[...] The video was released to download via iTunes on September 18, 2006 in Ireland and September 20, 2006 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E

A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour.

After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became {{a teacher at the}} school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and anti-life.

However, {{it was only when}} Wood saw her act in a show by BBC Scotland called Eighty-One Take Two that she was impressed enough to hire her friend for the show. Imrie played various roles throughout the run, like a co-presenter of McConomy (a spoof TV economy show), and most famously Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques. Imrie said in 2007, [...] "Miss Babs is still what I'm best known for, even though I don't go around with bright yellow hair." [...] During her run in As Seen On TV Imrie received a fan letter from playwright Alan Bennett. [...] "He wrote a card to me saying he adored Miss Babs. You can't imagine how thrilling that was. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that card today." [...] Imrie though believes that the praise should go to Wood's writing: [...] "Every word is of huge importance and crafted to perfection. It was a wonderful, happy accident that I met her." ...|$|E

There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4.

500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E

I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
