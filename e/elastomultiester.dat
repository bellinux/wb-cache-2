40|$|In December 2003, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) was {{entrusted}} by DG Enterprise {{to verify}} the validity and applicability of the testing methods, proposed by DuPont, for the identification, characterisation and quantification of their new fibre (<b>elastomultiester).</b> This is an elastic bicomponent fibre made {{by a combination of}} two different polyesters (side-by-side structure). The elastic properties are due to crimps that are formed, after heat treatment, and due to the different shrinkage of the two components. The crimp is not mechanically induced and the yarn can be used directly, as no texturing or covering before weaving is needed. Experimental results confirmed that microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can identify both the multicomponent nature of the new fibre and its chemical composition, whereas Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) can confirm only its chemical composition. The normal pre-treatment, described in Directive 96 / 73 /EC, was proved to be applicable to the new bicomponent fibre and the agreed allowance value of 1. 50 % was adopted for the new fibre, in agreement with the European Network of National Experts on Textile Labelling (ENNETL). The solubility properties of <b>elastomultiester</b> were evaluated. In particular, the chemical methods 1, 2, 4, 6 – 9, 13 and 14 of Directive 96 / 73 /EC were tested and considered suitable for the quantification of <b>elastomultiester</b> in binary mixtures with other fibres. With the exception of method 14, the novel fibre was insoluble in all the mentioned methods and showed correction factors d equal to the ones of polyester (1. 00 for methods 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13 and 1. 01 for methods 6 and 8, respectively). In addition, also the manual separation method described in Directive 96 / 73 /EC was proved to be suitable for the quantification of <b>elastomultiester</b> in binary mixtures with other fibres. A new quantitative method based on DSC was developed and successfully applied to the quantification of binary mixtures of <b>elastomultiester</b> with polyester and cotton and to ternary mixtures with polyester/cotton, polyester/viscose and modal/viscose. The method is also applicable to mixtures of <b>elastomultiester</b> with nylon. It led to a good repeatability and results were generally as good as the ones obtained with chemical methods. The comparison with quantification based on the manual separation method showed differences usually lower than 1 %. The method shows two important advantages, the first being the rapidity of the analysis and the second being the possibility to avoid manual separation in the quantification of mixtures polyester/elastomultiester. The JRC developed a test method to measure the recoverable stretch and the permanent deformation of yarns and single filaments based on elongation. Experiments performed on single filaments of <b>elastomultiester</b> showed that, at 50 % elongation, the novel fibre is intrinsically elastic and proved that the elasticity is not due to the construction of yarns and {{to the fact that they}} contain several single filaments; on the contrary single filaments are as elastic as yarns. In fact, in these conditions the per cent permanent deformations were usually lower than or equal to 10 %. Based on experimental results, discussions during the 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th ENNETL meetings, the name and definition agreed and proposed for the new fibre were “elastomultiester: fibre formed by interaction of two or more chemically distinct linear macromolecules in two or more distinct phases (of which none exceeds 85 % by mass) which contains ester groups as dominant functional unit (at least 85 %) and which, after suitable treatment, when stretched to one and half times its original length and released, recovers rapidly and substantially to its original length”.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove non-fibrous material, is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture regain in standard atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent. Based on the results of this study, laboratories across the EU and beyond have now at their disposal methods to quantify the new fibre in binary mixtures with polyester, <b>elastomultiester,</b> polyamide, chlorofibres, certain acrylic and modacrylic fibres, acetate, triacetate, polylactide, certain cellulose fibres and certain protein fibres.

40|$|In November 2011, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) was {{entrusted}} by DG Enterprise {{to verify}} the validity and applicability of the testing methods, proposed by DuPont, for the identification and quantification of their new fibre polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT). The fibre {{is a type of}} polyester that differs from the common one polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as it contains one more methylene group in the aliphatic chain that links the terephthalic moiety. Experimental results confirmed that PTT can be identified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). FT-IR is able to distinguish among the three types of polyester PTT, PET and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), whereas DSC can differentiate only between PTT and PET {{on the basis of their}} melting points. For quantification purposes, the normal pre-treatment described in the EU Regulation 1007 / 2011, was proved to be applicable to PTT and its correction factor b for mass loss during pre-treatment was established (0 %). This means that the novel fibre is completely insoluble when the normal pre-treatment is applied. The agreed allowance of the new fibre (which represents its humidity regain) was measured (0. 34 %). The European network of national experts on Textile Labelling (ENNETL) established the value of 1. 50 % for PTT agreed allowance, for consistency with the already established values for polyester and <b>elastomultiester.</b> The solubility properties of PTT were evaluated with 15 methods described in EU Regulation 1007 / 2011, all of them with the exception of one (method 12). The new fibre was insoluble in methods 1 - 11, 13 and 16. The d correction factors were established on the basis of the experimental work carried out by the JRC. The resulting values were: • 1. 00 for methods 1, 2, 3, 7 and 11; • 1. 01 for methods 4, 5, 9 and 10; • 1. 02 for method 13; • 1. 03 for methods 6, 8 and 16. PTT was completely soluble in method 14, whereas it was partially soluble in method 15 that consequently cannot be used in the quantification of blends containing PTT. 2 For the quantification of PTT in binary mixtures, manual separation is an adequate technique, whenever applicable. The following chemical dissolution methods can also be used: 1 - 11, 13, 14 and 16. The quantification results of binary mixtures PTT/PET obtained by DSC method, using calibration curves built up with PTT and PET manually extracted from the sample under evaluation, were in very good agreement with the reference ones obtained through manual separation. In fact, the differences expressed in terms of bias were in all cases lower than 1 %. In these conditions, the DSC method can be judged accurate. A consensus among the members of ENNETL was reached on the need to validate the new, if possible improved, DSC quantification method to be added to the Textile Regulation. Consequently, the JRC was entrusted to organise the validation exercise at European level according to ISO 5725 : 1994. The discussion concerning the name and the definition of this fibre would be held in the final ENNETL meeting, which will be organised in April-May 2013. JRC.

40|$|In 2011 DG Enterprise and Industry {{requested}} the European Commission’s DG-JRC to technical evaluate a petition submitted by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont). This petition {{requested the}} creation of a new generic fibre name under the Directive 2008 / 121 /EC on textile names, now repealed by the EU Regulation 1007 / 2011. This would allow distinguishing between their fibre, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) and, in particular, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), the two most common types of polyesters. Although the three polyesters are very similar in terms of chemical composition, according to DuPont, PTT fibres have a set of improved properties that justify the petition. As identification and quantification methods are required in order to allow market surveillance of textile products, the JRC was responsible for the verification of the test methods proposed by the applicant and for the development and validation of the new required ones. Regarding identification, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy can distinguish between PTT, PET and PBT. This distinction can be achieved also using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), but only on the basis of their crystallisation peaks, since the melting peaks of PTT and PBT occur at the same temperature. The mechanical properties of PTT were studied. Tests were carried out at 25 % elongation. In these conditions, PTT showed an elastic recovery and a permanent deformation ranging from 65. 7 to 78. 1 % and from 5. 4 to 8. 8 %, respectively. On the basis of such results, PTT cannot be considered an elastic fibre. Regarding quantification, the usual pre-treatment protocol is applicable to PTT fibres. The correction factor b for mass loss during pre-treatment for PTT was established as 0 %. The experimental value for the agreed allowance of PTT was determined (0. 34 %). However, for consistency with the values already adopted for polyester and <b>elastomultiester,</b> the value 1. 50 % was agreed by the members of the European Network of National Experts on Textile Labelling (ENNETL). PTT is completely soluble in method 14. The following correction factors d for PTT (mass loss due to dissolution methods) were determined: 1. 00 for methods 2, 3, 7 and 11; 1. 01 for methods 1, 4, 5, 9 and 10; 1. 02 for method 13; 1. 03 for methods 6, 8 and 16. Method 15 is not applicable to binary mixtures containing PTT. Several binary and ternary blends containing PTT were quantified using both manual separation method and chemical dissolution ones. The JRC developed a new DSC method that was proved to be adequate and accurate for the quantification of PTT in blends with PET. The method uses calibration curves prepared with yarns manually separated from the sample under analysis, thus ensuring a common thermal history. Different types of integration as well as multipoint and single point calibration curves based on PTT or PET melting peaks were evaluated. The JRC organised the validation of the optimised DSC method at European level, as a balanced uniform–level experiment with six levels and 15 laboratories. The best results were obtained using multipoint calibration curves based on the integration of PTT melting peak with a linear integration. The method was successfully validated and showed good accuracy, in terms of both trueness and precision, as proved by the following parameters: bias values (0. 06 - 1. 30 %), confidence limits at 95 % probability level (0. 60 - 1. 07 %) and HORRAT values (0. 5 – 2). Results were presented in two meetings of ENNETL, held in Ispra, Italy, on 30 th November 2012 and 4 th October 2013. The definition proposed by DuPont for PTT (“fibre formed of linear macromolecules comprising at least 85 % (by mass) in the chain of an ester of 1, 3 -propane diol and terephthalic acid) was consistent with the evaluation carried out. As regards the proposed name of the fibre (triexta) there was no consensus among the experts belonging to ENNETL. JRC. I. 1 -Chemical Assessment and Testin...|$|E
