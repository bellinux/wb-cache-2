50|$|The water {{resulting}} from this condensation of steam was suctioned by the extraction pumps and sent {{once again to}} the boilers’ steam drums, passing first through the water heaters, <b>feed</b> <b>tanks</b> and pumps, and finally to the economiser.

50|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} is {{an essential}} part of boiler operations. The feed water is put into the steam drum from a feed pump. In the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat. After the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser. From the condenser it is then pumped to the deaerated <b>feed</b> <b>tank.</b> From this tank it then goes back to the steam drum to complete its cycle. The feed water is never open to the atmosphere. This cycle is known as a closed system or Rankine cycle.|$|E

50|$|In a {{steam power}} plant, {{particularly}} shipboard ones, the condensate pump is normally located {{adjacent to the}} main condenser hotwell often directly below it. This pump sends the water to a make-up tank closer to the steam generator or boiler. If the tank is also designed to remove dissolved oxygen from the condensate, it {{is known as a}} deaereating <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> (DFT). The output of the DFT supplies the feed booster pump which, in turn, supplies the feedwater pump which returns the feedwater to the boiler so the cycle can start over. Two pumps in succession are used to provide sufficient net positive suction head to prevent cavitation and the subsequent damage associated with it.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other FR designs, the {{powdered}} feed is contacted on a solid {{heat carrier}} {{rather than a}} gaseous carrier. It {{involves the use of}} a heated rotating plate that disperses the feed powder particles for a short duration. This is achieved by the use of centrifugal forces, where it compresses the powder onto the plate’s surface, allowing for direct contact between the particles and hot metal, which enables a higher heat transfer rate. the figure on the right illustrates the TSE-FLAR set up, with the arrows illustrating the direction of the feed traveling from the <b>feed</b> <b>tank,</b> to the metering unit, to the rotating plate, and finally to the cooling water unit.|$|E

The managers refused to believe him and ordered continued feeding of water into the reactor; the water, however, flowed through the severed pipes into the lower levels of the plant, carrying radioactive debris and causing short circuits in the cableways common to all four blocks.Later, before trial he had mental breakdown and tried to kill himself.

5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems. [...] Subsequently, an internal recycling system, referred to as the [...] "internal recycle control" [...] or [...] "IRC" [...] was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the <b>feed</b> <b>tank</b> and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact. During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28 mm design used in 1990 to 34 mm with the Mark II model and 38 mm in 1997. This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30 m3/h in 1990 to 60 m3/h in 1997.|$|E

The <b>Feed</b> <b>Tank</b> operates under a vacuum, therefore the Dip Tubes will operate under a vacuum.

The <b>Feed</b> <b>Tank</b> was designed to simulate actual conditions in which the Dip Tubes would measure the differential pressure. The <b>Feed</b> <b>Tank</b> was made of Stainless Steel with a Lexan window to view inside the tank during testing. The <b>Feed</b> <b>Tank</b> was built per Drawing SRT-ETF-DD- 96008, Revision A.

Figure 2 shows that the Dip Tubes were responsive and accurate when compared to the data from the measuring scale on the view window. Then tests were conducted with 23 y Hg vacuum inside the tank and water flow rates of 3. 9 L/min, 1. 8 L/min, and 0. 7 L/min being fed to the tank.
