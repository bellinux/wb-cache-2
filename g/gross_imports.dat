We restricted our analysis to three industries (i.e., Electronics, Motor Vehicles, and Textiles and Apparel), and two years (i.e., 2007 and 2014). Our findings suggest that countries hold different positions at the various stages of the international production process, and these positions change over time. Moreover, these variations in centrality according to the roles countries occupy along the GVNs would remain undetected if more traditional measures of market power based on aggregate trade values were used.

A procedure called generalized maximum likelihood is used, and the results are compared with those of nonlinear least squares as a benchmark. The approach is applied to two models: (1) a six-commodity model in which the dependent variables are net imports in six categories and the independent variables are six weighted averages of the import- and export-price indices for these categories as well as the trade deficit; (2) a twelve-commodity model in which the dependent variables are the <b>gross</b> <b>imports</b> and gross exports (the latter measured negatively) in the six categories and the independent variables are the twelve import- and export-price indices and the trade deficit.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{aggregate}} trends in China’s trade performance from the 1840 s to the present. Based on historical benchmarks, {{we argue that}} China’s recent gains are not exclusively due to the reforms since 1978.

40|$|For much of {{the past}} thirty-face years Japan has {{imported}} a remarkably small share of the manufactured goods it consumes. This distinctive trade structure is regularly cited by policy makes as evidence that, despite the absence of formal barriers, foreign manufacturers are systemically denied access to the Japanese market. Alternative explanations of Japan's distinctive trade structure are possible. Using specifications directly derived from traditional models of comparative advantage, Japan's distinctive inter-industry trade structure can be largely explained by Japan's equally distinctive pattern of factor endowments. Scarcely any reference needs to be made at all to distinctive Japanese government trade policies. Japan's participation in intra-industry trade in manufactures is also distinctively low. Traditional models of comparative advantage do not explain intra-industry trade. Such trade can be explained, however, if allowance is made for product differentiation and economies of scale. While traditional models of comparative advantage explain net trade as a linear function of factor endowments, with intra-industry trade models gross trade in imports and exports can still be a function of factor endowments. Indeed, if expressed as a share of GNP, <b>gross</b> <b>imports</b> are still a linear function of factor endowments. Using this framework, it can be shown that Japan's intra-industry trade, like Japan's inter-industry trade, does conform to international patterns. The removal of the remaining distinctive Japanese barriers, both formal and informal, to the import of manufactures, while highly desirable from a diplomatic standpoint, may have little impact on Japanese trade structure...|$|E
40|$|China’s {{demand for}} imports helps support the global {{economic}} recovery, so China’s recent economic slowdown has caused international concern. China’s slowdown is concentrated in the industrial sector, while its emerging service sector has shown much new strength. However, China’s service sector is relatively closed and relies only modestly on imports. Accordingly, service sector growth is unlikely to offset the adverse implications of a slowing China for global trade. The recent slowdown in China’s economic growth has caused {{a great deal of}} concern, particularly among global trade partners that export to China. On November 3, China’s President Xi Jinping announced that expected real GDP growth {{over the next five years}} would be no lower than 6. 5 %, which is one-half percentage point lower than the previous estimate. The industrial sector has been particularly weak as it has expanded by only 0. 2 % over the past year. In addition, imports to China continue to fall dramatically, as shown in Figure 1. Import values in October 2015 were almost 19 % lower than they were in October of the previous year. However, a number of analysts (for example, Lardy 2015) have argued that concern about the slowdown in the Chinese economy—and the associated reduction in Chinese imports—is overblown. Instead, they point to the resilience in the country’s service sector. This sector has indeed been a source of relative strength, with reported growth of 11. 9 % over the past four quarters. In this Economic Letter, I show that the strength of China’s service sector is not likely to provide much support for gross exports from the rest of the world over the short term. The steep recent decline in China’s imports is consistent with the country’s growth pattern across different sectors. There has been a strong positive relationship between slower growth in <b>gross</b> <b>imports</b> and slower growth in industrial output over the past 15 years. However, imports and service outputs do not show a significant relationship. These results hold both for imports from non-commodity exporting advanced economies and for advance...|$|E

The results of Johansens's cointegration test indicated that there exist a long run and short run relationship among real gross domestic product, foreign direct investment, exports, imports and foreign direct investment in Ghana. The study found out that in the long run, exports had a positive effect on real gross domestic product and as a result, an increase in exports leads to an improvement in real <b>gross</b> domestic product. <b>Imports</b> and foreign direct investment had a negative effect on real gross domestic product, respectively.

40|$|A first {{approximation}} of the intermediate consumption matrix {{is necessary in}} the process of regionalization of national input-output tables, according to the available information at regional level. Different possibilities appear for this adjustment as could be: using location quotients, gravity models or commodity balance.

The use of location quotients is correct to generate domestic tables, but their traditional formulations do not detect cross-hauling and, therefore, it involves an overestimation of the domestic intermediate consumption.

[1], OECD-WTO [2] with {{the fragmentation of}} production processes across borders and the intensification of interconnectedness within supply chains, notably in East Asia, the importance of trade in intermediates has increased significantly in both goods and services trade.

The picture given by gross trade can be quite different from that by trade in value added; since in today’s production networks in East Asia, {{it is possible that}} the same intermediate goods and services are recorded many times as they go through customs. Value added generated by both domestic and foreign final demand, on the other hand, is more closely related with wages and employment, corporate profits, tax revenues, and finally national income.

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first paper that uses the Brazilian quarterly national accounts with this goal in mind. Besides estimating a demand equation (canonical model), as it is usual in the literature, we also explore the co-movements among total <b>imports,</b> <b>gross</b> fixed capital formation and household consumption (alternative model). The results underscore the role played by domestic income, which is the main determinant of total imports. The limited domestic supply of capital goods makes the allocation of domestic income also relevant to the imports dynamics. It should be noted, however, that this specification needs a better theoretical grounding. Evidence of nonlinearities has been found by different estimation techniques. Unfortunately its precise characterization turns out to be difficult due to the diversity of the results obtained. The out-of-sample assessment (one-step-ahead forecast) shows a good performance of the long-run vectors of the alternative models in predicting aggregate imports, meanwhile the best performance is obtained by the error correction representations of the canonical model. We believe those differences emerge from the different speeds of adjustment toward the long-run solutions...|$|R
