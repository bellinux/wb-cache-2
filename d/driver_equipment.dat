50|$|Initially, entry was {{confined}} to the few service trades then open to women, namely MT <b>Driver,</b> <b>Equipment</b> Assistant, Cook, Clerk and Mess and Kitchen Staff. A small number of fabric workers were also employed. By August 1939, the following additional trades were authorised: Teleprinter Operators, Telephone Operators and Plotters. It was in these latter trades that women’s natural temperament gave them a clear advantage over men, and in which they made {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of Britain. Hardly a photograph or film of those days, showing the WAAF manning the radar stations and plotting tables could fail to evoke memories of those brave women, most of whom would have been recruited and trained as original part-time pre-war auxiliaries, including some who worked on the balloon squadrons as fabric workers or, later in the war, handling the balloons themselves.|$|E

40|$|Throughout 1994 and 1995, Algoma Steel Inc. {{conducted}} several {{modifications to}} their No. 5 Reheat Furnace Combustion Air System during a major rebuild of the furnace. This involved a redesigned five pass recuperator, a replacement section of ductwork, {{and a new}} control scheme. Although the original objective {{of the project was}} to save gas energy with the new recuperator, it was also recognized that this was an ideal opportunity to deal with a serious and persistent ductwork cracking problem. Algoma Steel Inc. contracted FLOWCARE Engineering Inc. to determine the root source of the problem and design a solution. Through flow and spectrum analysis at the fan operating points, it was determined that the cause of the cracking was due to pressure pulsations resulting from a fan instability condition called rotating stall. The solution involved duct modifications, a revised control strategy that ensured fan operating stability and minor burner control modifications. The solution has not only eliminated all cracking problems, it has enhanced furnace controllability and provided immediate savings of electrical operating costs for the 1500 hp fan motor. It also identified an additional electrical savings of $ 156, 000 /yr which can be realized with fan and <b>driver</b> <b>equipment</b> modification...|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 149 - 152. Compressor {{and driver}} shafts often {{prove to be}} {{overstressed}} in equipment uprate situations. This paper shows how a change from conventional gear-type couplings to the more recent diaphragm coupling design can lower the shaft stresses sufficient to avoid shaft replacement during power uprates of centrifugal compressors or compressor <b>drivers.</b> <b>Equipment</b> uprate projects involving turbomachinery often appear to require time consuming and costly shaft replacements. However, closer examination of how the equipment vendor arrived at his maximum allowable stress levels may frequently show that such shaft replacements can be avoided without undue risk if the coupling selection is optimized. This conclusion {{is based on the}} fact that gear-type coupling have the potential of inducing in a shaft both torional stresses and bending stresses, whereas diaphragm couplings tend to primarily induce torisonal stresses and insignificant bending stresses at best. The economic incentives of finding ways of salvaging major rotating equipment shafts illustrated on a steam turbine shaft originally rated to transmit 17, 600 hp maximum at 6, 400 rpm. If uprating the turbine to 19, 600 hp were being considered, the required changeout of stationary steam path components would cost around $ 60, 000, but a combined replacement cost of about $ 500, 000 would probably be quoted for the main and spare rotor shafts. A rigorous calculation of shaft stresses shows the shaft factor of safety to be greater at 19, 600 hp using a diaphragm coupling than at 17, 600 hp using a conventional gear coupling...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} {{in both the}} time and the cost of installation of medium-to-large industrial gas turbine mechanical drive packages can be achieved.
