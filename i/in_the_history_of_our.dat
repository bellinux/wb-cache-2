25|$|In theory, either {{high enough}} energy {{concentrations}} or random chance could trigger the tunneling needed to set this event in motion. However an immense number of ultra-high energy particles and events have occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> universe, dwarfing by many {{orders of magnitude}} any events at human disposal. Hut and Rees note that, because we have observed cosmic ray collisions at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, {{at least for the}} foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight tera electron volts (8×1012 eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 1018 eV, a million times more powerful– the so-called Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit – and other cosmic events may be more powerful yet. Against this, John Leslie has argued that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider {{at the time of their}} respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.|$|E

A major reason for Germany's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower, {{it would have been}} impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion. One of its immediate results was the creation of the Warsaw Pact, which was signed on 14May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, as a formal response to this event, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.|$|E

500|$|Following {{news of the}} {{cancellation}} of Silent Hills, {{it was announced that}} P.T. would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from Kotaku stated [...] "It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make Silent Hills" [...] but that the deletion of P.T. was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of Polygon described Konami's removal as the [...] "most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible", but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo [...] "one of the coolest, most fascinating games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> medium". After {{the cancellation}}, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing Flappy Bird after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of Silent Hills, commented on P.T.s popularity, speculating that there were people who still have a passion for the Silent Hill series.|$|E

The opening scene, in which the characters frantically scramble to escape the Dunder Mifflin office due to what they believe is a fire, took about a day-and-a-half to shoot. It took much longer than the average 45 minutes of shooting time for a scene of that length due to the amount of stunt work involved.
