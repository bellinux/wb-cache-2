5|$|In the 1992–93 season, {{despite a}} 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, Jordan's streak of {{consecutive}} MVP seasons ended as {{he lost the}} award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, {{and became the first}} player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{responded by}} scoring 38 {{points in the}} next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan {{decided that he would}} resume wearing his former number, 23, immediately.

He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, 2006, a {{judge in}} Cook County, Illinois, {{determined}} that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5million in a breach of contract claim.

A DNA test showed <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> not {{the father of the}} child.|$|E
5|$|Playing in his 14th {{and final}} NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant). That year, <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> the only Washington player {{to play in}} all 82 games, {{starting}} in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.|$|E

As of the 2017 All-Star Game, 411 players have been selected to an All-Star Game roster at least once. However, only 283 of them have earned multiple selections to the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the match meant it was selected for live broadcast by ITV across their entire network, with on-site presentation by Jim Rosenthal, by then one of ITV Sport's main presenters, who shared the studio with Jimmy Greaves. Two separate commentary teams were used: one, consisting of ITV's senior commentator Brian Moore, Terry Yorath and Ian St. John, covered the game for the English and Welsh regions of the network, while the other, with Jock Brown and Joe <b>Jordan,</b> <b>was</b> for viewers in the Scottish ITV areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the Chicago Bulls, which saw them appear in six Finals.

5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Qandil {{began to}} work in {{broadcast}} television as the presenter of the program Aqwal al-Suhf ("In the Press"). In 1966 he became a media adviser to a television studio in Jordan, a role which ended after six weeks; the single broadcast of Aqwal al-Suhf in <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> met with consternation from the Jordanian royal government and after Qandil was notified of this disapproval, he immediately returned to Egypt where he continued presenting the program. His position in Aqwal al-Suhf ended in 1969 with his appointment {{as director of the}} Arab Broadcasting Stations Union (ABSU).|$|E
5|$|In 1993, <b>Jordan</b> <b>was</b> matched against {{close friend}} Charles Barkley, {{who was the}} league's reigning MVP at the Phoenix Suns.

The Bulls took Game 4, 111–105, with Jordan scoring 55 points and tying Rick Barry for the second-most points in an NBA Finals game. The Suns won Game 5, 108–98, sending the series back to Phoenix.
