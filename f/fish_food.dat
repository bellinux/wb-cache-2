5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the <b>Fish,</b> <b>Food</b> and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or <b>fish.</b> <b>Food</b> is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E

25|$|Asian arowanas are {{carnivorous}} {{and should}} be fed a high-quality diet of meaty food, such as shrimp and crickets. They are surface feeders and prefer to take food in the upper parts of the water column. Aquarists recommend live foods and meaty prepared foods. Examples of appropriate live foods include scorpions, centipedes, mealworms, crickets, shrimps, feeder fish, small frogs, and earthworms. Prepared foods include prawns (shrimp), lean pork, frozen <b>fish</b> <b>food,</b> and pelleted food. Some captive arowanas are fed Koi fry {{in an attempt to}} increase the vibrancy of their natural coloration.|$|E

Krill as a food source {{is known to have}} positive effects on some fish, such as stimulating appetite or resulting in an increased disease resistance. Furthermore, krill contains carotenoids and is thus used sometimes as a pigmentizing agent to color the skin and meat of some fish. About 34% of the Japanese catch of E. superba and 50% of E. pacifica are used for fish food; the Canadian catch is used almost exclusively for this purpose.|$|E

Products, such as fish oil and spirulina tablets are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).|$|E

50|$|Zebra loaches are {{peaceful}} fish {{suitable to}} community aquarium tanks. However, being bottom feeders, they may show some aggression against other smaller bottom feeders. Therefore, small corydoras are not suitable tankmates. They {{should be kept}} in groups of at least five. Any fewer and they will become stressed. They require some caves in which to hide during most of daylight. B. striata will accept a wide variety of <b>fish</b> <b>foods,</b> including live food such as blackworms, snails and small shrimps, and most commercial brands of sinking <b>fish</b> <b>foods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lake {{fishing for}} pike {{from the shore}} is {{especially}} effective during spring, when the big pike move into the shallows to spawn in weedy areas, and later many remain there to feed on other spawning coarse fish species to regain their condition after spawning. Smaller jack pike often remain in the shallows for their own protection, and for the small <b>fish</b> <b>food</b> available there. For the hot summer and during inactive phases, the larger female pike tend to retire to deeper water and/or places with better cover. This gives the boat angler good fishing {{during the summer and}} winter seasons. Trolling (towing a fairy or bait behind a moving boat) is a popular technique.|$|E
500|$|Because of the Great Salt Lake's high salinity, it has few fish, {{but they}} do occur in Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay when spring runoff brings fresh water into the lake. A few aquatic animals live in the lake's main basin, {{including}} centimeter-long brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana). Their tiny, hard-walled eggs or cysts (diameter about 200 micrometers) are harvested in quantity during the fall and early winter. They are fed to prawns in Asia, sold as novelty [...] "Sea-Monkeys," [...] sold either live or dehydrated in pet stores as a <b>fish</b> <b>food,</b> and used in testing of toxins, drugs, and other chemicals. There are also two species of brine fly as well as protozoa, rotifers, bacteria and algae.|$|E
500|$|The {{harvest of}} brine shrimp cysts during fall and early winter has {{developed}} into a significant local industry, with the lake providing 35 to 45 percent of the worldwide supply of brine shrimp, and cysts selling for as high as [...] Brine shrimp were first harvested during the 1950s and sold as commercial <b>fish</b> <b>food.</b> In the 1970s the focus changed to their eggs, known as cysts, which were sold primarily outside of the United States {{to be used as}} food for shrimp, prawns, and some fish. Today, these are mostly sold in East Asia and South America. The amount of cysts and the quality are affected by several factors, but salinity is most important. The cysts will hatch at 2 to 3% salinity, but the greatest productivity is at salinities above about 10%. If the salinity drops near 5 to 6%, the cysts will lose buoyancy and sink, making them more difficult to harvest.|$|E

500|$|Captive oscars may be fed {{prepared}} <b>fish</b> <b>food</b> {{designed for}} large carnivorous fish: crayfish, worms, and insects (such as flies, crickets and grasshoppers). Feeding live foods {{may increase the}} rate of growth but also may cause endoparasites. Poultry and/or mammalian flesh, including beefheart, should not be fed long term as these fatty foods will contribute to fatty liver disease. Since these fish eat fruit in the wild, items such as melons, oranges, and other fruits can also be used as a type of food. Just about anything that falls into the water would be eaten by oscars. Live feeder fish can be given, but fish such as goldfish and rosy red feeder minnows should not be fed. These contain an enzyme (thiaminase) within their flesh which binds vitamin B1, leading to deficiency. Most fish eaten by A. ocellatus in the wild are relatively sedentary catfish, including Bunocephalus, Rineloricaria, and Ochmacanthus species. The species uses a suction mechanism to capture prey, and has been reported to exhibit [...] "laying-on-side" [...] death mimicry in a similar fashion to Parachromis friedrichsthalii and Nimbochromis livingstonii.

2500|$|Crayfish {{are kept}} as pets in {{freshwater}} aquariums. Crayfish kept as pets in the US from local waters are usually kept with bluegill or bass, rather than goldfish or tropical or subtropical fish.

They will sometimes consume their old exoskeleton after it has moulted. Their disposition towards eating almost anything will also cause them to explore the edibility of aquarium plants in a fish tank. However, most species of dwarf crayfish, such as Cambarellus patzcuarensis, will not destructively dig or eat live aquarium plants. They are also relatively non-aggressive and can be kept safely with dwarf shrimp. Because of their very small size of [...] or less, some fish are often {{a threat to the}} crayfish.|$|E

The spillway was renovated in 2007. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources had planned to prohibit bread as food for the carp and ducks on January 1, 2009, only permitting commercial <b>fish</b> <b>food</b> {{as part of an effort}} to clean up the area and increase its wild nature, but subsequently reconsidered.|$|E
