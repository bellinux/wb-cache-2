[...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred two guys, and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting."

500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso. Pileggi, who had {{had to endure}} little to no make-up during the early seasons, noted that, [...] "They did a beautiful job and [...] looked awesome, but man, I hated it! I really don't know how those <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day. I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the nanobot infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets. The two sets were then mixed together electronically in post-production to give the effect of disease progression. The nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program. Composer Mark Snow's score for the episode was inspired by Daniel Sackheim's [...] "big-time feature-like action".|$|E
500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put big <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|The {{scripting}} of the film, tentatively titled as Running {{with the}} Bulls, {{was completed in}} November 2009 {{after three months of}} work. Zoya and Kagti incorporated real life observations, and specially wrote the character of Imraan for her brother Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film. The theme of the film was [...] "about three <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> the verge of making commitments in life", according to him. They used Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voice-over because they felt the poetry adds depth to the character and lends voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was penned down for Katrina's character, after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal filming was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain since the climax features running with the bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture and sports. The release date of the film was rescheduled thrice because the originally selected editor, Chandan Arora, fell ill and they had to redo the editing.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is one of Fey's {{favorite}} words, which she used multiple times when she appeared as an anchor on the Saturday Night Live sketch Weekend Update.

This episode marks the final appearance of Edie Falco, who was hired for a three-episode arc. Falco made her debut in the episode [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] as Celeste Cunningham, a Congresswoman and romantic interest of Jack's. She appeared in [...] "Secrets and Lies", where James Carville helps the fledgling relationship. The pair breaks up in Episode 210, when they realize their careers prevent them from staying together. Falco said that she was [...] "thrilled for the opportunity to work with such great comic actors", and expressed her enjoyment of watching the series.

500|$|... "La Llamada" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for Live! (1993). It was written by Selena y Los Dinos backup singer Pete Astudillo and Selena's brother, principal record producer and songwriter A. B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song {{was intended to be}} one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! album. Astudillo and Quintanilla III had spent an hour writing a song together. They wanted to write a song on a topic that many women face with their boyfriends. Quintanilla III had wanted to empower women, letting them know that they should hold their heads up and remember that life goes on. Selena favored the lyrical content and central theme, a common one in her songs. [...] "La Llamada" [...] was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas, at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions. Before Live! was released, the song was mixed by Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore, a family friend. Because Selena favored the song, the band released a music video. It was filmed in a beach house in Malibu, California. The video features Selena dancing with <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> one side and woman on the other.

500|$|Noted for his on-ice vision, passing ability, {{work ethic}} and {{complete}} overall game, Crosby has been {{considered one of the}} best players in the world since he was drafted in 2005. Wayne Gretzky said of Crosby, [...] "He's proven over and over that he's the best player in the game today. And it seems like the more important the game, the more impact that he makes on a game." [...] Gordie Howe was also impressed by Crosby, [...] "I met him and I've seen him play. Unless you put two <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> him, he'll kill you in a game". In 2016, Mario Lemieux praised his protégé for his ability to play both sides of the puck, [...] "I think he's more of a complete player. Defensively, I think he's improved a lot over the last couple of years." [...] On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Crosby was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. In that same year, Fox Sports ranked Crosby 15th on their [...] "21 greatest athletes of the 21st century (so far)" [...] list.

[...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E

[...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys.

500|$|In his career, Russell {{won five}} regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards. He was {{selected}} {{three times to}} the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969), {{and was the first}} season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the [...] "Athlete of the Decade". Russell is universally seen {{as one of the best}} NBA players ever, and was declared [...] "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" [...] by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. For his achievements, Russell was named [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by Sports Illustrated in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999. In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Bill Russell in a quote that says, [...] "There are two types of superstars.

500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E
