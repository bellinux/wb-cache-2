The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) establishes the basic rules for pharmaceutical <b>data</b> exclusivity <b>protection.</b> People’s Republic of China’s domestic law {{is consistent with the}} TRIPS agreement. In the drug registration approval process of the People’s Republic of China’s Drug Supervision Department, pharmaceutical <b>data</b> exclusivity <b>protection</b> has encountered some problems, including data authentication, exclusive rights to data, number of drugs requiring data to be submitted, and drug costs. In view of the long-term interests of the People’s Republic of China’s pharmaceutical industry and intellectual property protection trends, {{there are a lot of}} difficulties in the enforcement of pharmaceutical <b>data</b> exclusivity <b>protection</b> law that need to be overcome. Some measures can be taken, such as establishing a shorter <b>data</b> exclusivity <b>protection</b> period, only protecting the data submitted and relied on in the People’s Republic of China, only protecting the drugs that use new chemical components, allowing application and necessary research before the expiry of pharmaceutical <b>data</b> exclusivity <b>protection</b> period of generic drugs.

40|$|Data {{security}} and availability for operational use are frequently seen as conflicting goals. Research on searchable encryption and homomorphic encryption are a start, but they typically build from encryption methods that, at best, provide protections based on problems {{assumed to be}} computationally hard. By contrast, data encoding methods such as secret sharing provide information-theoretic <b>data</b> <b>protections.</b> Archives that distribute data using secret sharing can provide <b>data</b> <b>protections</b> that are resilient to malicious insiders, compromised systems, and untrusted components. In this paper, we create the Serial Interpolation Filter, a method for storing and interacting with sets of data that are secured and distributed using secret sharing. We provide the ability to operate over set-oriented data distributed across multiple repositories without exposing the original data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the security of our method under various attacker models and provide protocol extensions to handle colluding attackers. The Serial Interpolation Filter provides information-theoretic protections from a single attacker and computationally hard protections from colluding attackers. Comment: 6 pages and 3 figures.

25|$|Currently, as of March 2012, {{the need}} for a set of unified privacy {{policies}} has been met by the European Union with proposed legislation. The <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation is a proposed set of consistent regulations across the European Union that will protect Internet users from clandestine tracking and unauthorized personal data usage. This regulation will further protect users' privacy rights in two key ways: clearly defining the term “personal data” and increasing punishments for those who violate users' online privacy. In Article 4(2) of the proposed legislation, the definition of personal data is expanded significantly to include any information online that could be traced to an individual. In Articles 77 and 79 of the proposed legislation, appropriate punishments are outlined for many possible violations of users' privacy rights by controllers and effective enforcement of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> is guaranteed. The <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation will also hold companies accountable for violations of the regulation by implementing a unified legislation outlining specific repercussions for various types of violations based on severity.|$|E
