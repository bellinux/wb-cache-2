50|$|Didier De Radiguès {{moved up}} to 4th and the field started to get strung out. Schwantz gave Ron Haslam a little <b>bump</b> as he <b>passed</b> and Sarron crashed out.|$|R
50|$|As the {{facilities}} within the tubes of Lion Rock Tunnel {{are suffering from}} serious deterioration due to aging, as well as broken concrete on road surface which causes <b>bumping</b> when vehicles <b>pass</b> through, the Highways Department decided to undergo renovation works upon the tunnels in 2008. It will extend {{the lives of the}} tunnels for around 80 years more.|$|R
60|$|But {{we had no}} {{time for}} them. The yacht, {{completing}} the manoeuvre, headed into the wind with slatting canvas, and righted to an even keel. We were still plunging ahead, and directly in our path was the skiff. I saw Big Alec dive overboard and his mate leap for our bowsprit. Then came the crash as we struck the boat, and a series of grinding <b>bumps</b> as it <b>passed</b> under our bottom.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} <b>bumping</b> <b>forearms.</b> During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew {{there was a lot of}} talk about the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "They Will Kill Us All (Without Mercy)" [...] was {{directed}} by Mike Piscitelli. It depicts an African American man in a heavy jacket walking through Los Angeles, lip syncing the song's lyrics while dancing and making exaggerated gestures to the music. The band members appear as extras whom the man <b>bumps</b> into or <b>passes</b> on the street. During the final chorus the man is shot in the chest by an unseen gunman and bleeds to death on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In a 2009 interview, singer Matt Caughthran named it as his favorite of the band's videos and explained its nature: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{capabilities}} of the Super FX chip are demonstrated extensively in Stunt Race FX. Each course appears to be constructed with 3D polygons, complete with road <b>bumps</b> and overhead <b>passes,</b> resulting in a considerably large number of animation screens. Detailed billboard advertisements also appear throughout each race course. These realistic representations are possible on the Super NES because the Super FX chip renders 2D sprites in a visual format that resembled 3D polygons. Under this format, polygons do not [...] "crash" [...] together to become distorted, though the graphics run slower. This lack of speed is incorporated into the gameplay by featuring cars that are heavier and clumsier than those included in conventional racing games.|$|R
25|$|The Gold Coast 600 saw Jamie Whincup further {{extend his}} {{championship}} lead. Whincup and co-driver Paul Dumbrell finished runner-up in the Saturday race {{before going on}} to win the Sunday race. Shane Van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb won from pole on Saturday but incurred a drive-through penalty in the Sunday race and finished fifth. Tony D'Alberto, Alexandre Prémat and Dean Fiore all scored their first podium finish in V8 Supercars during the weekend, with D'Alberto and Tim Slade finishing third on Saturday, while Prémat and Scott McLaughlin finished second on Sunday ahead of Fiore and Michael Caruso. The Sunday result also saw the first podium finish of the season for Nissan. Whincup's championship rivals had difficult weekends, with Mark Winterbottom being relegated from the podium on Saturday after <b>bumping</b> and <b>passing</b> Slade at the final corner and suffering an engine problem late in the Sunday race before being spun by Russell Ingall. Craig Lowndes suffered damage in the Saturday race and finished eighteenth and was hurt by strategy on Sunday. With Chaz Mostert and Paul Morris struggling during the weekend, Whincup and Dumbrell easily secured the Endurance Cup.|$|R
50|$|Each team {{consists}} of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws {{the ball into}} the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the <b>bump</b> or <b>pass</b> so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense.|$|R
40|$|When you {{slip into}} the large and comfortably {{cushioned}} seat of a Farmall-H or a Farmall·M nd rest {{your hands on the}} large, automobile type steering wheel. right away you feel at home. As your left foot just naturally finds the clutch pedal and you put the tractor into gear you begin to get the feeling that here is a tractor that is as easy 10 drive as the family car. And as you give it the gas (gasoline. distillate or kerosene). and let in the clutch, you get the thrill which comes with the realization that here, under finger. tip control, is ready, eager power to romp through all your farm power jobs with salis· factoty thoroughness, speed and economy. When you hit rough ground you learn what it means todrive a tractor with irreversible worm steering gear. Yet. while none of the shocks occasioned by the front wheels encountering humps or <b>bumps</b> are <b>passed</b> back to your arms, you find the tractor instontly responsive to the lightest touch. Convenient to the right foot tl,re two differential brake pedals. For making short turns to right or lEft these pedals can be used separately. For equal brak iog of both rear wheels they can be instantly locked together 10 operate as one brake. The brakes and external expanding bands acting on forged sleel drums on the differential shafts. The large illustration at the riqht shows how conveniently the various controls are located. Note that the ball on the gear shift lever is right Under the steering wheel easy to reach and operate...|$|R
50|$|The first {{chairlift}} {{was installed}} {{during the summer}} of 1958. At the time it was the longest chairlift in the U.S. at over one mile, including a midway station. It was manufactured by Riblet Lift Company based in Washington state, using what was then some very novel design concepts. This included support towers that were not vertical but rather 90 degrees to the ground surface. The chairs were attached to the cable by weaving a bar {{into the center of the}} cable. This eliminated the uncomfortable <b>bump</b> when chairs <b>passed</b> over tower wheels due to the typical external clamp design. Since there was no power available in the area a large diesel generator and fuel tank with fuel capacity for the entire season were hauled to the summit. This also required that someone either stay on top or take the Tucker snow-cat up to start the generator and chairlift each day. Boyd Turner was the construction manager, but not a skier, living in Shaver Lake. He would volunteer with others to man the top station during that first year.|$|R
50|$|The Trail uses a {{segregated}} path on the Windsor Mill Road bridge, {{after which the}} Dickeyville Trail branches off to the north. The Gwynns Falls Trail mainline turns south, however, utilizing a section of Wetheredsville Road closed to motor vehicles. Along this stretch, the Hutton Trail branch leaves to the west. Just before approaching Franklintown Road again, the Trail narrows and travels west, leaving the Gwynns Falls valley and now running parallel to the Dead Run. The trail runs toward the Leakin Park parking lot, with two branches around the lot. Once across a bridge, the trail continues westward, close to Franklintown Road, utilizing two switchbacks to climb the steep grades. Along this stretch, another unnamed trail branch leaves to the south, a sidepath running alongside Winans Way. At William Street, the trail moves onto Franklintown Avenue, which utilizes traffic calming measures such as speed <b>bumps</b> as it <b>passes</b> between several homes. At Dogwood Road, the trail enters its own alignment south of Franklintown Road for the last time, and has a long curve alongside a ramp exiting Security Boulevard, Security Boulevard itself, and a ramp exiting Interstate 70. The Trail comes to its eastern end at the I-70 Park and Ride, the national eastern terminus of Interstate 70, which sits atop the city-county line.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores students’ {{learning}} journeys in {{and through}} units in Higher Education degree courses. The exploration focuses specifically on student learning failure. It does so by using empirical evidence from one Australian university over a two-year period. The argument presented here is that universities can exploit detailed data at their disposal to enhance students’ achievements on their learning journeys. An information-rich but modest Toolkit is proposed that provides {{a detailed description of}} student learning journeys in general, and of failure in particular. The Toolkit comprises an individual student’s current achievement in a unit (Grade); an individual student’s previous semester achievement (Grade Point Average); three failing Categories, namely, Academically Weak, Not Engaged or Speed <b>Bump</b> and two <b>passing</b> Categories, namely, Passing OK or Flagging, into one of which each individual student is assigned after encountering a unit; and the Group Learning Attainment of all students in that unit (an average of all Grades in a unit). The final Toolkit element concerns Dimensions of responsibility for learning. The Dimensions are Student, University, Course and Lecturer. This thesis suggests that student academic learning failure is an interrelationship of these four Dimensions. An argument is presented that the three non-Student Dimensions can impact negatively on student learning journeys, and are likely to contribute to failure. Notwithstanding these issues, the thesis concludes {{that it is possible to}} support and enhance student learning achievement journeys...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolving}} {{growth in}} networking and telecommunication technologies leads to their enhanced usage in many and {{different aspects of}} human activity. One of the technologies that shows great interest is Collabo-rative Virtual Environments (CVEs), which {{may be used in}} various applications, such as tele-education. This paper presents, analyzes and evaluates the basic elements of Elearn, a Collaborative Virtual Learning Environment (CVLE) that has been created for teaching electronic commerce. In Elearn, the virtual world, the web pages and the synchronous chat among the participants are integrated into the same environment. A user is represented as an avatar who can move, make gestures with its hands and head, <b>bump</b> into ob-jects, <b>pass</b> through them, etc. A detailed list of navigation directions is provided in order to help the user to move freely into the environment. The possibility of many users to coexist in Elearn is also supported. Collaboration and cooperation are its two components that enhance the learning effectiveness. Collabora-tion is supported among students and teachers with the use of synchronous chat. The chat window appears on the screen along with the virtual world and the web pages, motivating the participants to use it. Asyn-chronous communication is also supported, via email and discussion board. The evaluation of a CVLE is an important and difficult task. Pedagogical issues, like conceptual learning, collaboration, constructivism and adaptability, should be taken under serious consideration. These pa...|$|R
