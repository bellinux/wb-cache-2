25|$|In {{communications}} technologies without forward {{error correction}} and other physical layer protocol overhead, there is no distinction between <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and physical layer net bit rate. For example, the net as well as <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of Ethernet 10Base-T is 10Mbit/s. Due to the Manchester line code, each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20megabaud.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{is related}} to the symbol rate or {{modulation}} rate, which is expressed in bauds or symbols per second. However, the <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and the baud value are equal only when there are only two levels per symbol, representing 0 and 1, meaning that each symbol of a data transmission system carries exactly one bit of data; for example, {{this is not the case}} for modern modulation systems used in modems and LAN equipment.|$|E

30|$|In the figures, FDASH shows a slow {{increase}} in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and stably maintains the appropriate <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> after reaching it. On the other hand, SARA does not maintain an appropriate <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{even though it}} reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> quickly. The proposed scheme quickly reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and maintains this <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{sum up the}} results, FDASH {{maintains}} the appropriate <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and shows a low number of <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes. However, it requests a low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment until the client buffer reaches the target buffer level, so clients {{have to wait a}} long time to watch high-quality video. SARA reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> faster than other methods. However, it consumes client buffers quickly by requiring segments with an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> The proposed scheme reaches a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> faster than FDASH, and it {{maintains the}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> longer than SARA after reaching the <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> In addition, it usually shows a small quality variation.|$|R

The experiments show that for relatively low <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> both rate allocation strategies perform with excellent and almost sim-ilar accuracy (96 % at 0. 125 bpppb).

The method is operable to select and service {{a request for a}} communication session by selecting a <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and assigning the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> to the request. The method selects the request from a pool of queued requests and the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> from all supported <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> The request and <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> are selected based on calculations that determine an amount of power needed for each queued request at each <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> The calculations result in ratios representing each combination of power and <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> for each request. The method selects the ratio having the highest number of <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> per power unit and assigns the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> to the associated request.

2500|$|For example, the net bitrate (and {{thus the}} [...] "connection speed") of an IEEE 802.11a {{wireless}} network is the {{net bit rate}} of between 6 and 54Mbit/s, while the <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is between 12 and 72Mbit/s inclusive of error-correcting codes.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "connection speed" [...] of a V.92 {{voiceband}} modem typically {{refers to}} the <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> {{since there is no}} additional error-correction code. It can be up to 56,000bit/s downstreams and 48,000bit/s upstreams. A lower bit rate may be chosen during the connection establishment phase due to adaptive modulationslower but more robust modulation schemes are chosen in case of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Due to data compression, the actual data transmission rate or throughput (see below) may be higher.|$|E
2500|$|In modems and {{wireless}} systems, link adaptation (automatic adaption {{of the data}} rate and the modulation and/or error coding scheme to the signal quality) is often applied. In that context, the term peak bitrate denotes the net bitrate of the fastest and least robust transmission mode, used for example when the distance is very short between sender and transmitter. Some operating systems and network equipment may detect the [...] "connection speed" [...] (informal language) of a network access technology or communication device, implying the current net bit rate.

50|$|AMR-WB operates, like AMR, {{with nine}} {{different}} <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> The lowest <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> providing excellent speech quality {{in a clean}} environment is 12.65 kbit/s. Higher <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> are useful in background noise conditions and for music. Also, lower <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> of 6.60 and 8.85 kbit/s provide reasonable quality, especially when compared to narrow-band codecs.|$|R
30|$|In those {{simulation}} results, FDASH requests many segments {{at a low}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{until the}} target buffer level is reached. After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level. However, because it requests an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment, the download time for the segment is too long and the client buffer is quickly consumed. This causes an abrupt decrease in the segment <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> Moreover, since the SARA method increases the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> step by step from the low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> following an abrupt reduction in the <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes frequently. In addition, although FDASH and SARA show small variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases, they generally show large variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> decreases. On the other hand, the proposed scheme shows a small variation in both the increases and decreases in <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> according to the characteristics of the training data.|$|R

Such servers will be come increasingly more im-portant because of Variable <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> (VBR) compression standards such as MPEG- 2. ...|$|R
30|$|In Figs.  10 and 11, {{which are}} the results in the two Wi-Fi environments, FDASH shows the lowest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> {{although}} its number of <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes is smallest. SARA shows a higher average <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> than that of FDASH. However, it shows {{the largest number of}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes, and its variation in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also the largest. The proposed scheme shows a similar number of changes as FDASH. In addition, the proposed scheme shows the smallest variation and the highest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of all the schemes evaluated. Thus, it is clearly shown that the proposed method appropriately meets each element of a given QoE matrix.|$|R

Error correction under the DAB standard makes the signal more robust but reduces the total <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> available for streams.|$|R

As can be observed for the Stronger sequence, with an even <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> distribution and an advantageous scheme settings, the ML transmission schemes can show a benefit or an increase in terms of coverage at a similar Ucc value. The results for Wineyard and Reuter sequence only show a small increase or for the latter sequence even no increase in terms of coverage. For both sequences, only the video stream provides a quite even <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> distribution, but the audio <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is relative high compared to the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the video at QCIF resolution. Note that at higher resolutions the video <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> ratio is much higher whereas the audio <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> remains constant.
