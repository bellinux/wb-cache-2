50|$|An {{activity}} in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order {{necessary for the}} next processing step. Sorters, like the IBM 80 series Card Sorters, sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Sorting an <b>input</b> <b>card</b> deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, {{or a combination of}} the two methods.|$|E

50|$|Each <b>input</b> <b>card</b> {{was read}} at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} and survey vessels are fitted with shipborne wave records (SBWRs) which operate reliably with minimal servicing. In the past, the wave data have normally been logged as a time series, using central ship's computing facilities, or recorded by a simple chart recorder. This resulted in unacceptable post-processing delays and costs. This document describes an automatic logging/processing system which was installed and operated sucessfully {{for a number of}} years on OWS Cumulus, requiring manual intervention only at monthly intervals to download the processed data files. The system uses a dedicated personal computer, with analogue <b>input</b> <b>card,</b> to acquire and spectrally analyse the wave amplitude signal and to save the spectral data on hard disk.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{simulate}} an early Severe Accident (SA) scenario more detail through transferring the thermal-hydraulic status of the plant predicted by RELAP 5 computer code to SA Program (SAP).

40|$|The former Research Institute for Sustainable Energy (RISE) testing {{laboratory}} was originally a facility for measuring, monitoring and testing {{a variety of}} renewable energy systems. The RISE facility was independent of the School of Engineering and Energy, but has recently {{been taken over by}} the School as the Engineering and Energy Laboratory. Many of the systems associated with the laboratory have not been operated {{for a number of years}} and the condition of these systems, and the equipment that is associated with them, is not known. Personnel involved with the former RISE facility have since left Murdoch taking with them their knowledge of the facility. This project was primarily concerned with re-commissioning these systems and developing an operational knowledge of the SCADA based control system. Areas to be covered in particular were: •	connections to the grid from PV arrays and wind turbines •	PLC system and software •	inverters, solar array simulator, environmental chamber and other peripheral equipment •	power supplies such as the diesel generator, motor generator set and battery banks •	 3 phase permanently connected power monitors •	AC and DC electrical systems Initial inspections of the electrical systems showed that two key components of the facility were found to be defective and would need to be rectified if the facility was to function properly. These components were the diesel generator which provided electricity totally independent of the grid for testing purposes, and a fault on the PLC which was affecting the operation of the electrical systems. Also several main pieces of equipment had since been removed from the facility; most notably of these being the battery banks, main test inverter and the DC supply from the wind turbines located in what is now known as the Renewable Energy Outdoor Test Area (ROTA). Several pieces of equipment required for the operation of the diesel generator would also require attention such as the fuel tank and starting battery. Approval was granted for the alternator to be repaired and placed back into service. Approval was also granted for the purchase of a replacement analogue <b>input</b> <b>card</b> to rectify the fault with the PLC. In addition to this another requirement of the project was to develop a system so that the laboratory could be used as a training facility for future students. A procedure was developed so that an electrical system consisting of actual real components; a source, a transmission and distribution system and a load could be simulated. Software was also developed using National Instruments LabVIEW software to monitor and record various power parameters from the system. The system is referred to as the “Small Electrical Distribution System”. As an aside to this a program has been developed that monitors and records voltage, current and power that is being produced by the Real PV Array located on the roof of the Energy and Engineering Laboratory building. For someone who is unfamiliar with the setup of the electrical systems that make up the Energy and Engineering Laboratory a simplified block diagram of the Main AC switchboard has been produced. Schedules have been included of all socket inlets and outlets, main AC and communications cables and the Main AC Switchboard nomenclature. The diesel generator is nearly ready to be re-commissioned after approximately 5 years of non use. Procedures have been developed so that a user can configure the Main AC switchboard so that the “Small Electrical Distribution System” can be operated safely and measurements obtained and analysed. The main goal of the project was to get the diesel generator operating; therefore this report is focused on the equipment associated with the diesel generator. The equipment focused on was the diesel generator itself, the Main AC Switchboard, the Load Bank and the PLC system. Systems such as the Main DC switchboard and Solar Array Simulator were not covered in as much detail as they are not required for the “Small Electrical Distribution System”...|$|E

50|$|PLC {{software}} {{would be}} tested by sequencing the toggle switches to input the electrical {{signals to the}} <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> on the PLC, and then observing the response by software on the indicator lights and operator consoles. For small simple systems, this type of testing was manageable, and resulted in some degree of confidence that the control software would work once it was installed.

A new simulation language, the River System Modeling Methodology (RSMM), helps users construct simulation models for analyzing river pollution.

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the punched <b>card</b> <b>input.</b> A punched <b>card</b> <b>input</b> is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from punched cards. Most early computers used punched cards as their main input device. Along with a card punch, punched card readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A card punch is an output device that punches holes in cards under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with card punches and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R
40|$|The City of Dubuque, Iowa's new Water Division {{computer}} system was experiencing {{failures of the}} analog inputs ranging from signals out of tolerance by more than 30 percent to intermittent and sometimes complete loss of signals. The problem stemmed {{from a lack of}} signal isolation of the analog <b>input</b> <b>cards,</b> which made the inputs vulnerable to interference from storms and machinery. Electronic technician Bob Ervolino read an article in Tech Briefs describing an Ames Research Center solution to a similar problem.
