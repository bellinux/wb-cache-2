50|$|The Synthex is an 8-voice analog {{synthesizer}} with 2 oscillators per note, separate envelope generators, and chorus. The use of stable DCOs (digitally controlled analog oscillators) and oscillator cross modulation of Pulse Width and a multimode filter made it unique in its time. Unusually, the Synthex also contained a built {{in real-time and}} step-time 4-track monophonic sequencer with real-time transposition. The four different sequencer tracks can have different length, and sounds (Upper/Lower can be allocated to different tracks). Also {{it is possible to}} insert rests between notes as well as length of notes. Sequences and patches could be dumped to analog cassette tape through an audio interface.

This is achieved by using the control from a single eye, tracking the position of the pupil for direction, and using blinking as an input. As detection of eye motion proved too challenging, we built an accelerometer based tilt detector to determine head motion, so that, although not as applicable in this particular case, it might be use by a quadriplegic individual Introduction The system uses accelerometers to detect the user's head tilt in order to direct mouse movement on the monitor.

Short links are often included on printed materials so that people using mobile devices can quickly enter URLs. Although mobile transcription is a common use-case, link-shortening services generate output that is poorly suited to entry on mobile devices: links often contain numbers and capital letters that require time consuming mode switches on touch screen keyboards. With the aid of computational modeling, we identified problems with the output of a link-shortening service, bit. ly. Based {{on the results of}} this modeling, we hypothesized that longer links that are optimized for input on mobile keyboards would improve link entry speeds compared to shorter links that required <b>keyboard</b> <b>mode</b> switches. We conducted a human performance study that confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, we applied our method to a selection of different non-word mobile data-entry tasks.

40|$|The Glove-Enabled Computer Operations (GECO) system enables an extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) glove to be dual-purposed as a human-computer interface device. This paper describes {{the design and}} human participant testing of a right-handed GECO glove in a pressurized glove box. As part of {{an investigation into the}} usability of the GECO system for EVA data entry, twenty participants were asked to complete activities including (1) a Simon Says Games in which they attempted to duplicate random sequences of targeted finger strikes and (2) a Text Entry activity in which they used the GECO glove to enter target phrases in two different virtual <b>keyboard</b> <b>modes.</b> In a within-subjects design, both activities were performed both with and without vibrotactile feedback. Participants' mean accuracies in correctly generating finger strikes with the pressurized glove were surprisingly high, both with and without the benefit of tactile feedback. Five of the subjects achieved mean accuracies exceeding 99 % in both conditions. In Text Entry, tactile feedback provided a statistically significant performance benefit, quantified by characters entered per minute, as well as reduction in error rate. Secondary analyses of responses to a NASA Task Loader Index (TLX) subjective workload assessments reveal a benefit for tactile feedback in GECO glove use for data entry. This first-ever investigation of employment of a pressurized EVA glove for human-computer interface opens up a wide range of future applications, including text "chat" communications, manipulation of procedures/checklists, cataloguing/annotating images, scientific note taking, human-robot interaction, and control of suit and/or other EVA systems...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{aggressive}} focus on musical instruction within Rock Band 3, Rock Band 4 instead puts a larger {{focus on the}} franchise's core gameplay, multiplayer, and the overall feeling of the experience; Rigopulos felt that the franchise had become too [...] "sprawling" [...] in functionality, and that [...] "there is an existing gameplay core that is very powerful and very fun, and we don't want to tamper with that core. At the same time, {{we need to bring}} something new to the experience." [...] Owing to this renewed focus, the Pro Guitar and piano <b>keyboard</b> <b>modes</b> were dropped from the game. Rigopulos stated that Ubisoft's competing Rocksmith series [...] "is serving the audience that wants actual guitar instrumental instruction very well." [...] The new Freestyle Guitar Solo feature was something that Harmonix had built a prototype for in early 2014; at the time they did not have a clear concept of its use but found the mechanic to have potential and built up parts of Rock Band 4 around it. Rigopulos also noted that they were not trying to develop Rock Band 4 with competition from Guitar Hero Live in mind; that competition had caused the original over-saturation of the rhythm game market in 2009. With Rock Band 4, Harmonix' goal is a smaller but known fraction of the market of both old Rock Band players and new ones, such that meeting those numbers would make the game financially viable even if it does not outsell Guitar Hero Live. This goal also helps to manage the costs of the game as {{they do not have to}} manufacture as many instrument sets as they had done previously.|$|R

30|$|Several virtual {{keyboard}} designs {{have been}} proposed by commercial companies. For example, the SwitchXS <b>keyboard</b> provides various <b>modes</b> that implement mouse input and keyboard characters (AssistiveWare, 2013). In a common design, an initial switch activation initiates a cursor that follows a path across the keyboard and stops to select an item when the user triggers the switch device again. A default approach is for the user first to select a row containing a desired item and thereby direct the cursor to move across that row’s items for an additional user selection. Other keyboard designs use a similar strategy but define differently the groups of items that can be selected. For example, in the Logo keyboard (Norte & Lobo, 2007), two major scanning groups (numeric and alphabetic) are displayed, and the user first triggers the switch to select {{one of these two}} groups, and then selects the item in the selected group as the cursor moves across the group.|$|R
