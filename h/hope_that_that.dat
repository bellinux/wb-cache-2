2500|$|After {{reporting}} of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,"The ball {{is in the}} countryside of Spain and we <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Officials {{said that}} the attack may have been {{intended}} to abduct an IDF soldier, or to infiltrate a nearby community to attack civilians. [...] Defense Minister Ehud Barak {{said that the}} attack showed the need for [...] "determined Egyptian action" [...] against terrorism in Sinai, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret over {{the deaths of the}} Egyptian soldiers and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> incident would be a [...] "wake-up call" [...] to Egyptian forces.|$|E

60|$|Lady Staveley {{had known}} it, but up to <b>that</b> moment she had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{knowledge}} might have remained hidden {{as though it}} were unknown.|$|R
3000|$|But {{we found}} the carefarm {{ourselves}} 1 [….]. You have to search for yourself completely. Yes, I actually <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would be presented to you, like: ‘this would be something for you’. (FG 3) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to his}} revelation, Stephanopoulos told Jon Stewart on The Daily Show <b>that</b> when money {{is given to the}} Clinton Foundation [...] "everybody" [...] knows there's [...] "a <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> going to lead to something, and <b>that's</b> what {{you have to be careful}} of." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, my friends, let us <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> prayer will go up, {{even out}} of the wildest heart, in God's good time; {{and that it will}} not go up in vain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I owe him duty, no doubt. Had he bade me {{never to}} see you, I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would have sufficed. But {{there are other}} duties than that,--a duty even higher than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I see," [...] replied Charlie, with an amused expression; [...] "still I cannot help {{looking on}} the whole affair as very wonderful, and I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> does not disqualify me from {{recognising}} God's leading in the matter." ...|$|E
5000|$|Morrison {{has said}} [...] "'Everyone' {{is just a}} song of <b>hope,</b> <b>that's</b> what <b>that</b> is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in much anxiety about you," [...] he said. [...] "That you had been {{detained}} was certain; but I <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> petty rajah would not have ventured to harm you, for he would be sure <b>that,</b> sooner or later, {{we should have a}} heavy reckoning with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fogerty stated, [...] "On 'Lodi', I saw a {{much older}} person than I was, 'cause {{it is sort}} of a tragic telling. A guy is stuck in a place where people really don't {{appreciate}} him. Since I was {{at the beginning of a}} good career, I was <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> wouldn't happen to me." ...|$|R
60|$|However dreary my prospects, I was {{not without}} <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> Providence, which, {{at the very moment}} when hunger {{threatened}} me with dissolution, and when I might easily have been engulfed in the maw of the sea, had cast me upon those barren rocks, would finally direct some one to my relief.|$|E
6000|$|... “I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{has made}} the matter all right,” the Peruvian {{said in a low}} voice to Stephen; “but we must watch him closely for a short time and see how he goes on. If he looks at the matter sensibly he must see that, as I said, the gold is of no value to any of us at present.” ...|$|E
60|$|But I do not {{desire to}} dwell upon this {{branch of the}} {{question}} more than {{to say that this}} assumption of his is false, and I do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> fallacy will not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men. At all events, you ought to thank Judge Douglas for it; it is for your benefit it is made.|$|E
5000|$|... "No Exit" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews with many <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> now <b>that</b> Katherine's secret was revealed, {{the show will}} [...] "kick in".|$|R
60|$|To this Mrs. Proudie said nothing. Her {{dislike of}} the Signora Neroni was too deep to admit of her even <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> lady {{should see the}} error of her ways. Mrs. Proudie looked on the signora {{as one of the}} lost--one of those beyond the reach of Christian charity--and was {{therefore}} able to enjoy the luxury of hating her without the drawback of wishing her eventually well out of her sins.|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not tell}} Alftruda, as he meant to do, <b>that</b> she might see him soon in Lincoln Castle as its conqueror and lord. He half <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> when <b>that</b> day came, Alftruda might be somewhere else.|$|R
60|$|As may be imagined, though {{things had}} gone fairly well so far, nobody {{concerned}} {{of our party}} passed an over-comfortable night. The strain was too great to admit of it; and really they were all glad to {{find themselves in the}} court--which was, if possible, even more crowded on the following morning--filled with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> day might see the matter decided one way or the other.|$|E
60|$|Now, if {{you took}} any joy in reading that book, I have great <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> which follows may be every whit as {{pleasing}} to you; for I shall hereinafter {{have to do with}} the adventures of certain other worthies with whom you may have already become acquainted through my book and otherwise; and likewise of the adventures of certain other worthies, of whom you have not yet been told by me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me speak}} {{for a moment}} of the future," [...] he continued. [...] "Supposing you ring that {{telephone}} and hand me over to the authorities here? Well, that will be the end of me, without a doubt. You will have done what seemed to you to be the right thing, and I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> consciousness will sustain you, for, believe me, though it may not be at my will, your brother's life will most certainly answer for mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sitting {{among the}} potsherds, like Job; has he not, Mr. Dean? Well; let us <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> all <b>that</b> is over. When this {{accusation}} about the robbery was brought against him, I found myself bound to interfere." ...|$|R
2500|$|... – In a joint {{statement}} with Spain, Australia said through its Ambassador to the Philippines Bill Tweddel, stated <b>that</b> his government <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the incident will not derail the peace process. [...] "I think the only sensible thing I can say, when we are all {{trying to find out}} what exactly happened and why, is <b>that</b> how important it is for the people of the Philippines, including Mindanao, <b>that</b> the peace process is not discarded as a result of this tragedy and we are just <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> could be the case," [...] Tweddel said. The ambassador describes the event as a [...] "very sad development for those of us who care to see peace in the Philippines." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And now I shall {{leave my}} client's case in your hands. As to the verdict {{which you will}} give, I have no apprehension. You {{know as well as}} I do that she has not been guilty of this terrible crime. That you will so {{pronounce}} I do not for a moment doubt. But I do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> verdict will be accompanied by some expression on your part which may show to the world at large how great has been the wickedness displayed in the accusation." ...|$|E
60|$|You must {{expect to}} be beat {{a few times in}} your life, little man, if you live such a life as a man ought to live, let you be as strong and healthy as you may: and when you are, you will find it a very ugly feeling. I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> day you may have a stout staunch friend by you who is not beat; for, if you have not, you had best lie where you are, and wait for better times, as poor Tom did.|$|E
60|$|Now you {{understand}} how the inquisitors were able to devise that long array of minutely prying questions; questions whose subtlety and ingenuity and penetration are astonishing until we come to remember Loyseleur's performance and recognize their source. Ah, Bishop of Beauvais, you are now lamenting this cruel iniquity these many years in hell! Yes verily, unless one has come to your help. There is but one among the redeemed that would do it; and it is futile to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> one has not already done it--Joan of Arc.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do my best. I was thinking, <b>hoping,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> as I'm {{going right}} into the business--have gone into it already, in fact--and could begin life at once, <b>that</b> perhaps there wouldn't be much sense in waiting a great while." ...|$|R
500|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The Chairman of the Organising Committee, Hugh Leslie, who had lost a leg in World War Two, gave a speech aimed to change public perceptions about disabilities by addressing the power of language. These Games, he told the audience, ‘were designed {{to prove to the}} public <b>that</b> the person who was bodily handicapped was not a cripple, and he <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> horrible word would eventually be wiped out of use. He had a slogan which he hoped would be adopted by all disabled: [...] "I can, I will".|$|R
5000|$|Awarding {{the album}} four stars from New Release Today, Christopher Thiessen states, [...] "McClarney writes and {{performs}} these songs of praise and adoration so naturally <b>that</b> it will inspire many {{to join in}} and surrender all to the One who is worthy." [...] Jono Davies, giving the album five stars for Louder Than the Music, writes, [...] "these are songs <b>that</b> will last a long time." [...] Rating the album a 3.6 out of five at Christian Music Review, Laura Chambers describes, [...] "Everything and Nothing Less ushers us {{to a place of}} surrender in the <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>that’s</b> exactly what we’ll do when we get there." ...|$|R
60|$|Right then {{a thought}} came to him. It {{gave him a}} wee bit of hope, and seemed to help him run just a little faster. If the window of Farmer Brown's boy's room was open, he would run in there, and perhaps Shadow the Weasel wouldn't dare follow! How he did <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> window would be open! He {{knew that it was}} his only chance. He wasn't quite sure that it really was a chance, for Shadow was such a bold fellow that he might not be afraid to follow him right in, but it was worth trying.|$|E
60|$|But {{the hours}} slipped away, and {{little by little}} he grew less uneasy. He began to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> day would prove as {{peaceful}} as the previous day had been. Then {{suddenly there was a}} sharp report from the farther end of Paddy's pond. It was almost like a pistol shot. However, it wasn't a pistol shot. It wasn't a shot at all. It was the slap of Paddy's broad tail {{on the surface of the}} water. Instantly Lightfoot was on his feet. He knew just what that meant. He knew that Paddy had seen or heard or smelled a hunter.|$|E
60|$|During {{this visit}} to Venilik, I {{spent some time}} in {{renewing}} my inquiries as to the fate of my yacht's crew, but without success, and I was forced to the sad conclusion that they must either have been drowned or captured, and, it may be, killed after reaching the land. Long afterwards, however, I heard it rumoured that Mr Whitlaw had escaped and returned to his native country. There is, therefore, some reason to <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> sturdy and true-hearted American still lives to relate, among his other stirring narratives, an account of that memorable night when he was torpedoed on the Danube.|$|E

6000|$|Jack did {{not report}} himself to the naval {{authorities}} here, as he thought it quite possible <b>that</b> the [...] "Falcon" [...] had been recalled or sent on other service, and he <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> in <b>that</b> case he would, upon reaching the front, be appointed to some other ship.|$|R
40|$|To {{inform the}} {{development}} of a measure of caregiver burden for carers of children with chronic kidney disease, interviews were conducted with 16 caregivers and 10 renal healthcare professionals. A pool of 97 items generated from interviews was reduced to 60 items following review. A piloting exercise provided evidence for the usability, readability and relevance of items and informed further adaptations resulting in the 51 -item Paediatric Renal Caregiver Burden Scale. Further to assessment of its psychometric properties, it is <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> the Paediatric Renal Caregiver Burden Scale will serve as a useful measure of caregiver burden in paediatric chronic kidney disease...|$|R
