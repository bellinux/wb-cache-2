Sarah Arthur, the series' costume designer, explained how she achieved the detective's look. [...] "Holmes wouldn't {{have any interest in}} fashion so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> classic suits with a modern twist: narrow-leg trousers and a two-button, slim-cut jacket. I also went for slim-cut shirts and a sweeping coat for all the action scenes—it looks great against the London skyline." ...|$|E

He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

At the time, I was working on Once in a Blue Moon so I didn't have time to send a pitch. When I finished that project, my long time best friend, Becky Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. I remembered that I had been asked to send one as well, so we briefly considered sending a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead though, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 1978 US Open, Evert {{would play}} sixteen-year-old Pam Shriver in the final. [...] Shriver showed Evert {{she was to}} be taken seriously in the match by winning her first service game at 15 points for Evert, which was {{the first game of the}} match. [...] Evert would have a hard time shaking Shriver off during the first set because of mostly double {{faulting}} three-times in one game in the eight game of the set to allow Shriver to break back to level the set 4-games all. [...] Evert would lose the next game to go down 4 games to 5, which she said [...] "I was disgusted with those three double-faults...when I get nervous, serving is one of the first things that goes. [...] But even at 5-4, I felt very confident. [...] I didn't think there was any way I could lose." [...] During the subsequent game, Evert would only lose one point on serve to get the match back level at 5 games-all. [...] In the critical 11-game, Evert would show why experience matters and broke the youngster's serve, which allowed Evert to win the opening set 7 games to 5. [...] Evert and Shriver would battle to an even 4-all in the second set before the youngster showed her inexperience by having a 40 to love game, and simply put Shriver could not close it out against the relentless effort of Evert. [...] The points after this was the following: Evert winning on a forehand return, then made a winning volley, then got deuce with a galloping forehand up the line, Shriver won the next point with a booming service to get the advantage with a volley, Shriver on game point lead her forehand astray, lastly Evert won the game by hitting two unreturnable returns. [...] In the tenth game of the set, Shriver tried her best by getting most shots back, but Evert still won the set 6 games to 4, which gave Evert her fourth US Open title in a row and first one on the hard DecoTurf. [...] Evert later said [...] "I felt hungary to win...When the chips were down, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> passing shots and made them. [...] I hit the lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when I finally got to match point <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> a winner and I hit it. I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E
