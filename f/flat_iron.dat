5|$|These sister {{stations}} were of similar design and were built, opened, and closed together. Stella South, with a generating capacity of 300megawatts (MW), {{was built on}} the site of the Blaydon Races, and Stella North, with a capacity of 240MW, on that of the former Lemington Hall. They powered local homes and the many heavy industries of Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham. The large buildings, chimneys and cooling towers were visible from afar. Their operation required coal trains on both sides of the river to supply them with fuel and river traffic by <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> barges to dump ash in the North Sea. After their closure in 1991, they were demolished in stages between 1992 and 1997. Following the stations' demolition, the sites underwent redevelopment: the North site into a large business and industrial park, the South into a housing estate.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{seaplane}} service only operated {{and carried}} out maintenance from a specially adapted floating dock known as HMS <b>Flat</b> <b>Iron.</b> This floating dock was able to submerge and allow two seaplanes to navigate onto it and then raise itself back up to allow for complex maintenance. During the 1930s the Royal Air Force improved RAF Pembroke Dock by the installation of two 'B' and one 'T' hangar and in 1938, the floating dock was towed to Invergordon as it was redundant. In 1935, the first spillway was constructed which allowed aircraft {{to be removed from}} the water whatever the tide. During this period, Sir Arthur Travers Harris (Bomber Harris) was the Officer Commanding RAF Pembroke Dock and 210 Squadron as a Wing Commander.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} two-field system, a three-field system allows for {{significantly}} more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allows for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture creates a surplus of oats {{that can be used}} to feed horses. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a mouldboard, or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Most {{models have}} {{electric}} heating; cordless curling <b>irons</b> or <b>flat</b> <b>irons</b> typically use butane, and some <b>flat</b> <b>irons</b> use batteries that can {{last up to}} 30 minutes for straightening. Overuse of these tools can cause severe damage to hair.|$|R

25|$|The Pan-American Exposition of 1901 is most remembered because President William McKinley {{was assassinated}} by an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. McKinley died eight days later. On Sunday morning, September 15, 1901, President McKinley’s casket {{was closed and}} the honor guard placed the casket into a hearse. Close behind the {{followed}} President Theodore Roosevelt with Secretary Elihu Root {{and other members of}} the Cabinet following. The procession moved through a vast throng to the Buffalo City Hall where the body, lying in state, was viewed by one hundred and fifty thousand people. Toward the end of the afternoon, Indians from the exposition, in their blankets and feathers, followed by their squaws filed by. The Indians liked President McKinley and they had come to see the Great Father. A few hours before they had sent a wreath of purple astors accompanied by the inscription: “Farewell of Geronimo, Blue Horse, <b>Flat</b> <b>Iron</b> and Red Shirt and the seven hundred braves of the Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Like President Lincoln and Garfield, President McKinley never abused authority except on the side of mercy. The martyred Great White Chief will stand in memory next to the Savior of mankind. We loved him living, we love him still.” As the Indians passed, each of them dropped a white carnation upon the President’s coffin.|$|E
500|$|The first escape {{attempt to}} shatter Alcatraz's {{reputation}} as an [...] "escape-proof" [...] prison was made on December 16, 1937 by Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe. During their work assignment {{in one of the}} workshops, they cut the <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> bars of the window and climbed into the bay waters to escape. It was a stormy day and the bay water was highly turbulent. As the escapees were not found, they were declared drowned by the prison authorities as it was conjectured that they drowned in the bay and their bodies swept out into the sea due to the turbulent bay currents.|$|E
500|$|In December 1992 Wolfgang Puck was {{the first}} celebrity chef to open an upscale {{restaurant}} in a Las Vegas gambling resort with Spago at Caesars Palace. Located in The Forum Shops arcade, the restaurant is divided into a cafe facing the shopping mall serving lighter, lower-cost dishes, and a more formal dining room to the rear. Under the direction of Executive Chef Eric Klein, the menu changes daily with seasonal American fare, such as [...] "Roasted Organic Baby Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, Handmade Agnolotti, and Kobe <b>Flat</b> <b>Iron</b> Steak 'Hunan Style'". The restaurant has long been lauded for its pizzas, pastas, homemade sausages, burgers and braised ribs.|$|E

50|$|A hair iron or hair tong {{is a tool}} used {{to change}} the {{structure}} of the hair using heat. There are three general kinds: curling irons, used to make the hair curly, straightening irons, commonly called straighteners or <b>flat</b> <b>irons,</b> used to straighten the hair, and crimping irons, used to create crimps of the desired size in the hair.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic wigs {{are usually}} {{made from a}} fine fiber that mimics human hair. This fiber {{can be made in}} almost any color and hairstyle, and is often glossier than human hair. However, this fiber is {{sensitive}} to heat and cannot be styled with <b>flat</b> <b>irons</b> or curling irons. There is a newer synthetic fiber that can take heat up to a certain temperature.|$|R
500|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{by-products}} {{from the burning}} of coal in power stations. Ash from the Stella stations was taken out to sea by three <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> barges: Bobby Shaftoe, Bessie Surtees and Hexhamshire Lass. All three were built by Charles Hill & Sons of Bristol, in 1955. Bessie Surtees {{was the first to}} be put into service, in April 1955. On each trip, each ship took up to 500 tonnes of ash from the stations down the river and dumped it in the North Sea, [...] off the coast. Originally, they carried ash waste from Dunston power station as well. Their frequent passages made them a common sight on the Tyne. Each was [...] long and [...] wide, weighed 680 tonnes, and had a crew of seven. They were managed by Stephenson Clarke Shipping Ltd but owned by the CEGB. The ships went further up the Tyne than did any other, and so needed a shallow draft. The entire load of ash was dumped through two hydraulically operated doors in only a few minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{head and}} arm {{had been built}} with {{assistance}} from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier. The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel and his structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton {{was attached to the}} center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> bars which culminated in a mesh of metal straps, known as [...] "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually. To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac.|$|E
2500|$|Brouwer [...] "flattens" [...] his sheet {{as with a}} <b>flat</b> <b>iron,</b> without {{removing}} the folds and wrinkles. This example {{is better than the}} coffee cup one as it shows that uniqueness of the fixed point may fail. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as Banach's, that guarantee uniqueness.|$|E
25|$|Afro-textured hair is {{the natural}} hair texture of certain populations in Africa, the African diaspora, Australia and Asia, {{which has not been}} altered by hot combs, <b>flat</b> <b>irons</b> or {{chemicals}} (through perming, relaxation or other straightening methods). Each strand of this hair type grows in a tiny, spring-like helix shape. The overall effect is such that, compared to straight, wavy or curly hair, afro-textured hair appears denser.|$|R

2500|$|The steel gridshells of the {{exhibition}} pavilions of the 1896 All-Russian Industrial and Handicrafts Exposition in Nizhny Novgorod were the first publicly prominent examples of Shukhov's new system. Two pavilions of this type were built for the Nizhni Novgorod exposition, one oval in plan and one circular. The roofs of these pavilions were doubly curved gridshells formed entirely of a lattice of straight angle-iron and <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> bars. Shukhov himself called them azhurnaia bashnia ("lace tower", i.e., lattice tower). The patent of this system, for which Shukhov applied in 1895, was awarded in 1899.|$|E
2500|$|The Pine Tavern's menu {{is based}} on locally {{produced}} foods and ingredients. [...] For example, prime rib and the <b>flat</b> <b>iron</b> steaks served at the restaurant are from Oregon Country Beef, a Central Oregon ranching operation that raises hormone-free cattle. [...] The restaurant's lamb is from a sheep ranch near Shaniko, Oregon, north of Bend. [...] Their salmon is line-caught chinook from the Columbia River. [...] The chef uses Oregon hazelnuts for the crust on brie appetizers while pears, apples, and marionberries served in various dishes are from Pacific Northwest orchards and berry farms. [...] As a result, the Pine Tavern's menu helps to support local ranchers and farmers as well as serving dinner guests.|$|E
5000|$|Artificial hair integrations, more {{commonly}} known as hair extensions or hair weaves, add length and/or fullness to human hair. Hair extensions are usually clipped on by other hair by incorporating additional human or synthetic hair.

50|$|Formaldehyde may {{be present}} in hair {{smoothing}} solutions or as a vapor in the air. Stylists and clients may inhale formaldehyde as a gas or a vapor into the lungs and respiratory tract. Formaldehyde vapor can also make contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or throat.

50|$|Straightening <b>irons,</b> straighteners, or <b>flat</b> <b>irons</b> work by {{breaking}} down the positive hydrogen bonds found in the hair's cortex, which cause hair to open, bend and become curly. Once the bonds are broken, hair is prevented from holding its original, natural form, though the hydrogen bonds can re-form if exposed to moisture. Straightening irons use mainly ceramic material for their plates. Low-end straighteners use a single layer of ceramic coating on the plates, whereas high-end straighteners use multiple layers or even 100% ceramic material. Some straightening irons are fitted with an automatic shut off feature to prevent fire accidents.|$|R
