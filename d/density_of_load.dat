30|$|In {{order to}} realize the robust {{optimization}} of uncertain structures {{in the absence of}} the probabilistic distribution information of uncertainties, several non-probabilistic methods have been proposed in recent years to account for the uncertainties [18, 19]. Au et al. [20] proposed a robust design method based on the convex model and achieved the robustness of the objective function by minimizing the worst value of unsatisfactory degree functions of the uncertain parameters and ensured the feasibility robustness by a sub-optimization conducting the worst-case analysis. Takewaki and Ben–Haim [21] represented the uncertainties in the power spectral <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> and the parameters of the structure’s vibration model by info-gap models, and proposed a robust—satisficing methodology for the info-gap robust design of uncertain structures. However, the above methods are very complex when the parameter numbers are large. Sun et al. [22] proposed a bi-level mathematical model with interval objective and constraint functions for robust design optimization. The single objective function was converted into two objective functions for minimizing the mean and variation while the constraint functions were reformulated with the acceptable robustness level. However, the so-called robust solution obtained by their method cannot ensure the robustness of all constraints. Karer and Skrjanc [23] proposed a robust optimization framework for PID controllers by describing the uncertain dynamics of the process as an interval model, which was firstly transformed into a deterministic model and then solved by a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Li et al. [24] proposed an actuator placement robust optimization method for active vibration control system with interval parameters. Both nominal value and radius of the performance index were considered in the interval optimization model, which was also transformed into a deterministic one by weighted processing and then solved by GA.|$|E

Several methods <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by {{the characteristics of the}} explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loaded</b> charge can be obtained that is within 80-99% of the theoretical maximum <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the explosive. High load density can reduce sensitivity by making the mass more resistant to internal friction. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual crystals are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the warhead. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as dead-pressing, in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in the fatigue-life analysis of structures is predicting the parameters <b>of</b> the structure <b>loading</b> spectra under real operating conditions. If the loading spectrum is obtained from a load time series using a two-parametric rainflow counting method, then it is possible topresent the distribution <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>load</b> cycles in the two-dimensional space of the loading-spectrum parametersČ the amplitude and the mean <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> cycles. It is beneficial for the prediction <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> cycles if the distribution <b>of</b> <b>load</b> cycles is described by a continuous probability density function. We found in our previous studies that the different shapes of the multi-component probability <b>density</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>load</b> cycles can be modelled by a mixture of Gaussian functions if the parameters ofthe mixture are estimated using a maximum-likelihood method. One of the mainproblems connected with such an approach is the estimation of the number of components of the load-cycle distribution.

40|$|Estimates of the {{effective}} elastic thickness (Te) of the oceanic lithosphere based on gravity and bathymetric data from island loads are commonly {{significantly lower than}} those based on the wavelength of plate bending at subduction zones.

A fifth possible contribution to the discrepancy is an incorrect assumption about the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> volcanic <b>loads.</b> We suggest that load densities have been systematically overestimated in studies of lithospheric flexure, potentially resulting in systematic underestimation of effective elastic thicknesses and overestimation of the effects of hotspot volcanism.

30|$|Hauling {{is another}} mining {{activity}} {{needed to be}} optimized for mining cost minimization. The production rate and cost of hauling are substantially influenced by {{the magnitude of the}} payloads of the trucks (Dickerson et al. 1986) which highly depends on a fill factor decided by the particle size of the blasted material. Lower fragmentation size results in higher fill factor and higher production rate for the trucks. However, when weight capacity of the trucks is reached, production rate remains constant even if fragmentation size decreases. In this case, unnecessary fragmentation causes an increase in unit cost of drilling and blasting. If the bulk <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loaded</b> material is small, the lowering the fragmentation size can be considered to increase the truck’s production. Otherwise, the weight limit of the trucks does not allow to increase production even though the fragmentation size decreases.|$|R

40|$|Organic {{materials}} are ubiquitous in the geologic environment, and can exert significant {{influence over the}} interfacial properties of minerals. However, due to the complexity in their structure and interaction with soil solids, their impact has remained relatively unquantified. This study investigated the engineering behaviors of organoclays, which were synthesized in the laboratory using naturally occurring clay minerals and quaternary ammonium compounds of controlled structure and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading.</b> Organic cations were chosen to {{study the effects of}} functional group structure and size. The laboratory investigation showed that the presence of the organic cations on the mineral surfaces led to increased hydrophobicity of all clays tested. Conduction studies on the electrical, hydraulic, and thermal properties of the organoclay composites suggested that increasing the total organic carbon content resulted in decreased electrical and thermal conductivity, but increased hydraulic conductivity, due to the reduced swelling of the base clay mineral phase. Electrokinetic properties of the organoclays illustrated that compared with the clay's naturally occurring inorganic cations, exchanged quaternary ammonium cations were more likely bound within a particle's shear plane. Consequently, organoclays had less negative zeta potential than that of unmodified bentonite. Increasing the length of one carbon tail was more effective at binding organic cations within the shear plane than increasing the size of the cation, when compared on the basis of total organic carbon content. In terms of large strain strength, the modified organic clays exhibited increased shear strength, in part owing to the reduction in water content caused by the presence of the hydrophobic organic layering. Shear strength increased with single carbon tail length or with cation size, although the latter effect tended to reach a plateau as the length of the four short cation tails increased from 2 to 4. In terms of small strain behavior, the shear modulus was shown to be a function of the total organic carbon content. It is believed that number of particle contacts increased as the organic carbon content increased. Stiffness increased as either the size of the cation or the total organic carbon content was increased. Damping also increased as the organic loading was increased, with the organic phase acting as an energy dissipation mechanism. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Burns, Susan E.; Committee Member: Frost, J.

40|$|Rare {{individuals}} of Xenopus laevis exhibit frequent initiation of transcription in the spacers of oocyte ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Using electron microscopy we have characterized spacer transcription {{in such an}} individual and have confirmed that the sites of transcription initiation correspond to the imperfectly duplicated promoters ("Bam islands") present in the X. laevis rDNA spacer. We have cloned a repeat unit containing a gene and a spacer from this individual and have injected the recombinant plasmid, pXlr 164, into oocytes of other X. laevis individuals. In electron microscope preparations the spacers {{of some of the}} cloned repeats were transcribed by RNA polymerase I. This demonstrates that the ability to initiate transcription at the Bam islands is a property of the spacer DNA. On pXlr 164, initiation in the spacer occurred about 5 % as frequently as transcription from the gene promoter. However, transcribed spacers were as closely packed with RNA polymerase as was the gene. We conclude that polymerase I promoters may vary over a wide range in the frequency with which they "activate" but that once activated all can load polymerases to maximal density. The presence or absence of spacer transcription had no observable effect on either the frequency of activation or the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> polymerase <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> the gene immediately downstream. A subclone, pXlr 264, containing only spacer DNA also showed regular initiation and termination, providing further evidence that there is an effective "fail-safe" termination signal 225 base pairs upstream from the rRNA gene initiation site...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of direction-wise {{interpolation}} is proposed. Its merits are first presented {{by considering the}} interpolation of 1 st order motion Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) and 3 D (ω 1, ω 2, θ) wave drift load Quadratic Transfer Functions (QTFs). In a recent publication (see Ref. [1]), the importance of wave spreading on the spectral <b>density</b> <b>of</b> wave drift <b>loads</b> for a standard storage capacity LNG Carrier (135, 000 m 3) in shallow water has been demonstrated. The computation <b>of</b> above-mentioned spectral <b>densities</b> requires the pre-calculation {{of a large number}} of 4 D (ω 1, ω 2, θ 1, θ 2) wave drift load QTF and interpolations between the calculated directions. Application of the new method is investigated in this more challenging context. Examples are selected in the buoyant LNG floating system area with an LNG Carrier in shallow water and an FLNG in deep water...|$|R
40|$|Micro- and nanostructured polymer brushes on diamond can be {{directly}} prepared by carbon templating and amplification of the latent structures by photografting of a broad variety of vinyl monomers such as styrenes, acrylates and methacrylates. Even template structures with lateral dimensions as small as 5 nm can be selectively amplified and defined polymer brush gradients {{of a variety of}} functional polymers are realizable by this technique. Furthermore, conjugation with a model protein (GFP) results in protein <b>density</b> gradients <b>of</b> high <b>loading</b> and improved chemical stability. The effective functionalization of chemically and biologically inert diamond surfaces with stable functional polymer brushes, the possibility of structuring by the carbon templating technique and the direct biofunctionalization are crucial steps for the development of diamond based biosensors.
