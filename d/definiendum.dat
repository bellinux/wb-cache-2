Repeated application of a rule of revision generates sequences of hypotheses, which can be used to define logics of circular concepts.

5000|$|In modern usage, a {{definition}} is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to {{a word or}} group of words. The word or group of words {{that is to be}} defined is called the <b>definiendum,</b> and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the definiens. In the definition [...] "An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa", the word [...] "elephant" [...] is the <b>definiendum,</b> and everything after the word [...] "is" [...] is the definiens.|$|E
5000|$|A {{definition}} {{may very}} well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed in every definition definiens and <b>definiendum</b> are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no known}} {{syntactic}} {{characterization of the}} set of finite definitions, and finite definitions are not closed under standard logical operations, such as conjunction and disjunction. Maricarmen Martinez has identified some syntactic features under which the set of finite definitions is closed. She has shown that if [...] contains only unary predicates, apart from identity, contains no function symbols, and the <b>definienda</b> of [...] are all unary, then [...] is finite.|$|R
5000|$|Inductive {{definitions}} are semantically interpreted via fixed points, hypotheses [...] {{for which}} [...] In general, revision sequences will not reach fixed points.

5000|$|Revision theory, {{while in}} some respects similar {{to the theory of}} {{inductive}} definitions, differs in several ways. Most importantly, revision need not be monotonic, {{which is to say that}} extensions at later stages need not be supersets of extensions at earlier stages, as illustrated by the first example above. Relatedly, revision theory does not postulate any restrictions on the syntactic form of definitions. Inductive definitions require their definientia to be positive, in the sense that <b>definienda</b> can only appear in definientia under an even number of negations. (This assumes that negation, conjunction, disjunction, and the universal quantifier are the primitive logical connectives, and the remaining classical connectives are simply defined symbols.)

40|$|Most current definitional {{question}} answering systems apply one-size-fits-all lexicosyntactic patterns to identify definitions. By analyzing a large set of online definitions, this {{study shows that}} the semantic types of <b>definienda</b> constrain both lexical semantics and lexicosyntactic patterns of the definientia. For example, “heart ” has the semantic type [Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component] and its definition (e. g., “heart locates between the lungs”) incorporates semantic-typedependent lexicosyntactic patterns (e. g., “TERM locates …”) and terms (e. g., “lung ” has the same semantic type [Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component]). In contrast, “AIDS ” has a different semantic type [Disease or Syndrome]; its definition (e. g., “An infectious disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus”) consists of different lexicosyntactic patterns (e. g., “…causes by…”) and terms (e. g., “infectious disease ” has the semantic type [Disease or Syndrome]).

40|$|This {{original}} and enticing book provides a fresh, unifying perspective on many {{old and new}} logico-philosophical conundrums. Its basic thesis is that many concepts central in ordinary and philosophical discourse are inherently circular and thus cannot be fully understood {{as long as one}} remains within the confines of a standard theory of definitions. As an alternative, the authors develop a revision theory of definitions, which allows definitions to be circular without this giving rise to contradiction (but, at worst, to “vacuous ” uses of <b>definienda).</b> The theory is applied with varying levels of detail to a circular analysis of concepts as diverse as truth, predication, necessity, physical object, etc. The focus is on truth, and hope is expressed that {{a deeper understanding of the}} Liar and related paradoxes has been provided: “We have tried to show that once the circularity of truth is recognized, a great deal of its behavior begins to make sense. In particular, from this viewpoint, the existence of the paradoxes seems as natural as the existence of the eclipses ” (p. 142). We think that this hope is fully justified, although some problems remain that future research in this field should take into account.

Question bears on the existence, and not just the being or “subsistence”, of the objects of science. In the second chapter, I argue that hypotheses, for Aristotle, are {{assumptions}} of the existence of the primary elements of the science, which also includes nominal definitions of the primary elements of the science and of their per se attributes among the syllogistic premises. These definitions are nominal not because they fail to be truth-valuable (as on the usual understanding of the contrast between definitions and hypotheses), but only because they do not, of themselves, afford knowledge of the existence of their <b>definienda.</b> I Aristotle's scientific syllogism that goes back to the Greek and' Medieval commentators. In Chapter 6, I provide a kind of rationale for my interpretation of the ei esti-ti esti distinction" in terms of existence and essence by indicating how the notion of existence as a locative predicate may be implicit in the Aristotelian,’framework.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid room for {{difference}} in interpretation, lawmakers (codificators) sometimes deviate from etymological (<b>definiendum</b> plus definientia) definitions. In doing so, they approach the term from the law enforcement point of view.The best example {{is the definition of}} narcotics in the United Nations Conventions. Narcotics are substances and preparations that induce drowsiness, sleep, stupor, insensibility, etc., and that these effects (and their rate) are complicated to prove, e.g. during litigation. Thus, the legal definition of a narcotic is {{whether or not it is}} listed on the Schedules of the Convention. If it is on some of the Schedules, it is narcotic.|$|E
50|$|The logician Alfred Tarski {{presented}} two {{criteria for}} evaluating definitions as analyses of concepts: formal correctness and material adequacy. The criterion of formal correctness states {{that in a}} definition, the <b>definiendum</b> must not occur in the definiens. The criterion of material adequacy says that the definition must be faithful to the concept being analyzed. Gupta and Belnap recommend siding with material adequacy in {{cases in which the}} two criteria conflict. To determine whether a circular definition provides a good analysis of a concept requires evaluating the material adequacy of the definition. Some circular definitions will be good analyses, while some will not. Either way, formal correctness, in Tarski’s sense, will be violated.|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} one hundred years {{development}} of mathematical statistics has reached rather high level. A universal relative and non-dimensional factor which {{is known as a}} coefficient of variation is widely used for practical calculations, analysis and comparison of various stochastic processes. A variety of methodologies for evaluation of possible variations in <b>definienda</b> is used in case when a small amount of measurements (less that 30) is made in order to study the required parameter. While doing that a number of measurements executed {{with the help of the}}se regularities can be significantly increased that permits reliably (correctly) to assess numerical characterristics of the investigated parameters. However according to GOST (All Union State Standard) 21153. 2 – 84 some corrections in methodology for determination of minimum required number of measurements (less 30) have appeared to be insignificant for obtaining a reliable safety, for example, in the field of civil construction (catastrophic accidents: in Moscow – Transvaal Park and Basmanny Market; assembly and other constructions: in Poland, France and others). In 2007 it has been proposed to use chi-square criterion for determination of the required number of measurements when their number is less than 30 and appropriate patents of Eurasian Patent Organization and the Republic of Belarus have been obtained for the proposal. For this purpose Brownlie’s proposal has been used to assess confidence limits of dispersion values with the help of the chi-square criterion and the proposal has been supported by A. N. Kolmogorov who is an originator of exact mathematical probability calculus. The paper presents results of calculations for the required number of measurements in accordance with four methodologies and comparative analysis of the obtained results. It has appeared that in case when we are using chi-square criterion for the reliability level of 0. 9 or even more it is necessary to make the largest number of measurements (determinations). While increasing variation coefficient and predicted reliability level the number of the required measurements is also increased. An effort has been made to apply a robust methodology, which does not depend on the form of a distribution law, for determination of minimum number of the required measurements.

In this fashion, imprisonment can become [...] "true freedom", and massacres [...] "pacification". Persuasive definitions can change or distort the meaning while keeping the original evaluations {{that the use of}} a word evokes. Quasi-definitions consist in the modification of the emotive meaning of a word without altering the descriptive one. The speaker can quasi-define a word by qualifying the <b>definiendum</b> without setting forth what the term actually means.

5000|$|An {{explanatory}} combinatorial dictionary (ECD) {{is a type}} of monolingual dictionary {{designed to}} be part of a meaning-text linguistic model of a natural language. It is intended to be a complete record of the lexicon of a given language. [...] As such, it identifies and describes, in separate entries, each of the language's lexemes (roughly speaking, each word or set of inflected forms based on a single stem) and phrasemes (roughly speaking, idioms and other multi-word fixed expressions). Among other things, each entry contains (1) a definition that incorporates a lexeme's semantic actants (for example, the <b>definiendum</b> of give takes the form X gives Y to Z, where its three actants are expressed — the giver X, the thing given Y, and the person given to, Z) (2) complete information on lexical co-occurrence (e.g. the entry for attack tells you that one of its collocations is launch an attack, the entry for party provides throw a party, and the entry for lecture provides deliver a lecture — enabling the user to avoid making an error like *deliver a party); (3) an extensive set of examples. The ECD is a production dictionary — that is, it aims to provide all the information needed for a foreign learner or automaton to produce perfectly formed utterances of the language. Since the lexemes and phrasemes of a natural language number in the hundreds of thousands, a complete ECD, in paper form, would occupy the space of a large encyclopaedia. Such a work has yet to be achieved; while ECDs of Russian and French have been published, each describes less than one percent of the vocabulary of the respective languages.|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that term senses can be automatically ranked by how strongly they possess a given opinion-related property, by applying PageRank, the well known random-walk algorithm lying at {{the basis of the}} Google search engine, to a graph in which nodes are represented by eXtended WordNet synsets and links are represented by the binary relation si ◮ sk (“the gloss of synset si contains a term belonging to synset sk”). In other words, these properties are seen as “flowing ” through this graph, from the <b>definiendum</b> (i. e., the synset being defined) to the definiens (i. e., a synset which occurs in the gloss of the <b>definiendum),</b> with PageRank controlling the “hydraulics ” of this flow. In this paper we contend that two other random-walk algorithms may be equally adequate to this task, and provide an intuitive justification to support this claim. The first is a random-walk algorithm different from PageRank which we apply to the “inverse ” graph, i. e., with properties flowing from the definiens to the <b>definiendum.</b> The second algorithm is a bidirectional randomwalk algorithm, which assumes that properties may flow from the definiens to the <b>definiendum</b> and viceversa.

40|$|The {{definition}} of individual liberty as {{the absence of}} coercion or violence (threatened or actual) includes a circularity problem. A look at prominent representatives of classical liberalism and libertarianism (Hayek, Rothbard, Hoppe, Jasay) reveals that this is typical of classical liberals {{as well as of}} libertarians, though the latter avoid a confusion of power and freedom. However, the respective definitions of individual liberty analysed here rest on the assumption that coercion (or violence) presupposes the absence of the (voluntary) agreement of the coerced party. Thus they use the <b>definiendum</b> in a modified form (voluntariness) as part of the definiens in order to define the <b>definiendum.</b> The resulting circle can be avoided by looking at coercion and freedom (non-coercion) as representatives of the class of two-level decisions (meta-decision and object-decision) with different costs on the meta-level. While coercion means that the coerced party has to face or faces artificial costs in case of a negative meta-decision, non-coercion (freedom) does not. As a conclusion we define freedom as the absence of artificial interference in the private sphere of another person that would produce artificial costs for that person if she/he opted for a negative meta-decision...|$|E

This approach focuses on verbs that typically appear in definitions (= definitor verbs). We specify search patterns based on the valency frames of these definitor verbs and use them (1) to detect and delimit text segments containing definitions and (2) to annotate their main functional components: the <b>definiendum</b> (the term that is defined) and the definiens (meaning postulates for this term).
