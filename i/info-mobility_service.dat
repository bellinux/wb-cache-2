40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the background and the objectives of an European Commission funded project GiMoDig (Geospatial <b>info-mobility</b> <b>service</b> by real-time data-integration and generalisation), which was recently started. The background of the project lies in the goal to improve the accessibility of the national primary topographic databases, especially for mobile users. A prototype system providing geo-spatial service will be implemented and used as a test-bed in the frame of the project. The common access interface is based on the emerging standards like XML and Open GIS Consortium’s specifications. Besides methods for transferring vector-formatted data based on standards like GML and SVG, the work comprises several important issues like development of methods for real-time generalisation and data integration, definition of global schema, thematic harmonisation of geodata, development of methods for data transformation to a EUREF co-ordinate system, a study on small-display cartography and identification of the most important use cases for topographic data in mobile environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{studies the}} usability of topographic maps in mobile devices. In order {{to evaluate the}} usability, field tests in a national park were arranged {{with a group of}} test users. The purpose of the evaluation was to identify, at an early stage of the project, preliminary design principles for maps in small displays, as well as main benefits and obstacles for using topographic maps in mobile devices. The evaluation was part of the GiMoDig project (Geospatial <b>Info-mobility</b> <b>Service</b> by Real-time Data-integration and generalisation), funded by the EU. The paper presents in detail the design of the user evaluation and discusses its results. One of the central findings was that the main benefit of the mobile map services (besides the location information provided by the GPS module) was regarded to be the combining of additional information from various databases and its presentation over the topographic map data. In future mobile map services, the symbology, placement of symbols and other visualization will have to be adapted to small displays. Finally, we conclude that the scenario-based design and early user evaluation in the field are methods well-suited for developing mobile applications utilizing topographic maps. 1...|$|E
40|$|A Multi-resolution/representation-database (MRDB) can be {{described}} as a spatial database, which can be used to store the same real-world-phenomena at different levels of precision, accuracy and resolution. Furthermore these phenomena can be stored in different ways of presentation or symbolisation. In an MRDB, different views on the same physical objects or phenomena can be stored and linked. This variety of sights can stem from different views of the world, different applications, as well as different resolutions. These lead to differences in the objects as such, i. e. in the semantics and in the geometry. There are two main features that characterise a MRDB:! different levels of detail (LoDs) are stored in one database and! the objects in the different levels are linked. There are several reasons for introducing a MRDB: On the one hand it allows for a multi-scale analysis of the data: Information in one resolution can be analysed with respect to information given on another resolution. A major reason for National Mapping Agencies to investigate and implement MRDB is the possibility of propagating updates between the scales. At the Institute for Cartography and Geoinformatics (ikg) two projects with different objectives deal with MRDB. The project Geospatial <b>Info-mobility</b> <b>Service</b> by real-time Data-integration and generalisation (GiMoDig) aims at developing methods for spatial data delivery from national primary geo-database for mobile use...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} a first hypothesis {{of a business}} model for an intelligent LBS for personal mobility. This business model has been developed inside FP 7 i-Tour project. i-Tour stands for “intelligent Transport system for Optimized URban trips” {{and it is a}} so-called Collaborative Focused Research Project presented to the call on Surface Sustainable Transport topic “SST. 2008. 3. 1. 2 Intelligent mobility systems and multi-modal interfaces for transport of passengers”. In order to develop a business model for next generation personal mobility systems, an as-is analysis has been performed, resulting in a scenario characterized by the wide diffusion of wireless connections at urban and regional scale (e. g. UMTS, Wi-Fi or WiMax); by <b>info-mobility</b> <b>services</b> promoting multi-modal transport; by the development of transportation services based on localization technologies. The business model has been, then, proposed taking into account two different business strategies and two different organizations, and developing a financial analysis, including a break-even analysis useful to support a first feasibility study for a distinctive go-to-market strategy...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} a Mobile Wireless Vehicular Environment Simulation (MoVES) {{framework for the}} parallel and distributed simulation of vehicular wireless ad hoc networks (VANETs). The proposed framework supports extensible, module-based and layered modeling, and scalable, accurate and efficient simulation of vehicular scenarios integrated with wireless communication and mobile services/applications. The vehicular layer includes models for vehicles, synthetic and trace-driven mobility, driver behavior, GPS-based street maps, intersection policies and traffic lights. The wireless communication layer currently includes models for physical propagation, and a network protocol stack including IEEE 802. 11 Medium Access Control, up to the Application layer. MoVES provides a platform for microscopic modeling and simulation-based analysis of wireless vehicular scenarios and communication-based services and applications, like Intelligent Transportation Systems, communication-based monitoring/control and <b>info-mobility</b> <b>services.</b> The framework includes design solutions for scalable, accurate and efficient parallel and distributed simulation of complex, vehicular communication scenarios executed over cost-effective, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) simulation architectures. Dynamic model partition and adaptation-based load balancing solutions have been designed by exploiting common assumptions and model characteristics, in a user-transparent way. Test-bed performance evaluation for realistic scenarios has shown the effectiveness of MoVES in terms of simulation efficiency, scalability, adaptation and simulation accuracy...|$|R
30|$|The {{framework}} {{is based on}} a data-driven spatial generalization of the dataset of trajectories. The results obtained with the application of this framework show how trajectories can be anonymized to a high level of protection against re-identification while preserving the possibility of mining clusters of trajectories, which enables novel powerful analytic <b>services</b> for <b>info-mobility</b> or location-based <b>services.</b> We highlight that the mobility data published after the privacy transformation strategy, described in the following, is suitable for collective data analyses useful for extracting knowledge describing the collective mobility behavior of a population. Clearly, in cases where for providing a service it is necessary to identify specific, personal trajectories related to a specific user, this {{framework is}} not adequate. This because in that context {{one of the most important}} aspects is to maintain clear and well-defined the information at individual level, which is what we want to obfuscate with our transformation. In other words, the goal here is to enable collective analytical tool while protecting the individual privacy.|$|R
40|$|Smart {{phones are}} widely {{accepted}} and popular with navigation and route guidance functionality becoming a standard feature. Locations based services, henceforth {{referred to as}} LBS in this document, are used in various contexts and are becoming more accessible with the wide adoption of mobile smart phones. Industry experts expect that Location based services {{to be a major}} success and will account for large market share and profits in mobile services. Service providers in this area are coming up with innovative services trying to grab a share in this potential area. On the other hand, there is also some pessimism on the pace at which LBS taking-off in practice due to various reasons. For any service or business to be successful it should create value to the end-users. There are many key players involved to make LBS realizable and providing value, which include technology providers, service providers, telecom companies, regulation and standardization bodies and end-users. This thesis is a literature review of LBS and its general applications in real world with emphasis on its use in mountaineering. Scope of this literature review is to study the components of LBS, its architecture, positioning techniques, general application area, established standards and potential business model. While emphasizing LBS use in mountaineering, a concluded LBS demo project for mountaineering, sponsored by Eu-ropean Commission, called PARAMOUNT (Public Safety & Commercial <b>Info-Mobility</b> Applications & <b>Services</b> in the Mountains) is taken as reference. From business pers-pective, a conceptual business model called STOF (Service, Technology, Organization and Finance) model is used to analyze PARAMOUNT. /Kir 1...|$|R
