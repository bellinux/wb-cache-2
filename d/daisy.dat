50|$|The {{second phase}} of the {{simulation}} documents what happens as the sun's luminosity continues to increase, heating the surface of Daisyworld beyond a comfortable range for the <b>daisies.</b> This temperature increase causes white <b>daisies,</b> who are better able to stay cool because of their high albedo or ability to reflect sunlight, to gain a selective advantage over the black <b>daisies.</b> White <b>daisies</b> begin replacing black <b>daisies,</b> which has a cooling effect on Daisyworld. The result is that Daisyworld's surface temperature remains habitable - in fact almost constant - even as the luminosity of the sun continues to increase.|$|R
