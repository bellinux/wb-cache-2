40|$|Prion {{infection}} {{is characterized by}} the conversion of host cellular prion protein (PrPC) into disease-related conformers (PrPSc) and can be arrested in vivo by passive immunization with anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies. Here, we show that the ability of an antibody to cure prion-infected cells correlates with its binding affinity for PrPC rather than PrPSc. We have visualized this interaction at the molecular level by determining the crystal structure of human PrP bound to the Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody ICSM 18, which has the highest affinity for PrPC and the <b>highest</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> in vitro and in vivo. In this crystal structure, human PrP is observed in its native PrPC conformation. Interactions between neighboring PrP molecules in the crystal structure are mediated by close homotypic contacts between residues at position 129 that lead to the formation of a 4 -strand intermolecular β-sheet. The importance of this residue in mediating protein–protein contact could explain the genetic susceptibility and prion strain selection determined by polymorphic residue 129 in human prion disease, one of the strongest common susceptibility polymorphisms known in any human disease...|$|R
40|$|Both {{conventional}} and innovative biomedical approaches require cost-effective protein drugs with <b>high</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency,</b> improved bioavailability, biocompatibility, stability and pharmacokinetics. The growing longevity {{of the human}} population, the increasing incidence and prevalence of age-related diseases and the better comprehension of genetic-linked disorders prompt to develop natural and engineered drugs addressed to fulfill emerging therapeutic demands. Conventional microbial systems have been for long time exploited to produce biotherapeutics, competing with animal cells due to easier operation and lower process costs. However, both biological platforms exhibit important drawbacks (mainly associated to intracellular retention of the product, lack of post-translational modifications and conformational stresses), that cannot be overcome through further strain optimization merely due to physiological constraints. The metabolic diversity among microorganisms offers a spectrum of unconventional hosts, that, being able to bypass some of these weaknesses, are under progressive incorporation into production pipelines. In this review we describe the main biological traits and potentials of emerging bacterial, yeast, fungal and microalgae systems, by comparing selected leading species with well established conventional organisms with a long run in protein drug production...|$|R
40|$|Aim :  This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the antiarthritic and chondroprotective potentials of Lakshadi Guggul (LG) and Cissus quadrangularis encapsulated in novel alginate-enclosed chitosan-calcium phosphate nanocarriers (NCs) both in vitro in primary human chondrocytes and in vivo in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. Materials & methods : Chondrocytes exposed to IL- 1 beta and osteoarthritis chondrocytes grown in an ex vivo inflammation-based coculture were incubated with different concentrations of herbals, and cell modulatory activities were determined. For in vivo studies, herbals and their encapsulated nanoformulations were administered orally to DBA/ 1 mice with collagen-induce arthritis. Results : C. quadrangularis and LG showed enhanced chondroprotective and proliferative activity in IL- 1 beta-exposed primary chondrocytes, with LG showing the <b>highest</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency.</b> LG increased viability, proliferative and mitogenic activity, and inhibited cell apoptosis and mitochondrial depolarization. In vivo studies with LG and alginate-enclosed chitosan-calcium phosphate LG NCs revealed cartilage regenerative activity in those administered with the nanoformulation. The NCs were nontoxic to mice, reduced joint swelling and paw volume, and inhibited gene expression of MMPs and cytokines. Conclusion : The promising {{results from this study}} reveal, for the first time, the novel polymeric NC encapsulating LG as a potential therapeutic for rheumatic diseases.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to induce potent immune {{antitumor}} activities, we investigated, within the rat 9 L gliosarcoma model, distal therapeutic vaccinations associating three therapies: dendritic cell vaccination, intratumoral granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene transfer, and tumor apoptosis induction. Vaccines of dendritic cells coinjected with processed GM-CSF secreting 9 L cells induced systemic responses, resulting in the complete regression of distant preimplanted 9 L tumor masses in, with the best strategy, 94 % of male rats. All of the cured rats developed a long-term resistance to a rechallenge with parental cells. The curative responses were correlated with the detection of elevated specific cytotoxic activities and a CD 4 +, CD 8 + T cell-, and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated IFN-gamma production. The survival rate of the rat seemed more directly linked {{to the amount of}} GM-CSF secreted by the transduced tumor cells, which in turn depended on the toxicity of the apoptosis-inducing treatment, than to the level of apoptosis induced. Unexpectedly, alive GM-CSF secreting 9 L cells became apoptotic when injected in vivo. Thus we documented the positive role of apoptosis in the induction of therapeutic antitumor responses by comparing, at equal GM-CSF exogenous supply, the effects of dendritic cells coinjected with apoptotic or necrotic 9 L cells. The data showed the superior therapeutic efficiency of combined vaccines containing apoptotic tumor cells. In conclusion, vaccinations with dendritic cells associated with apoptotic tumor cells secreting GM-CSF show a very <b>high</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> that should show promise for the treatment of human cancer.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAbs) {{represent the}} fastest growing class of therapeutic proteins. The increasing demand for mAb manufacturing and the associated high production costs call for the pharmaceutical industry to improve its current production processes or develop more efficient alternative production platforms. The experimental control of IgG fucosylation to enhance antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity constitutes one of the promising strategies to improve the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and to potentially reduce the therapeutic cost. We report here that the EB 66 cell line derived from duck embryonic stem cells can be efficiently genetically engineered to produce mAbs at yields beyond a 1 g/L, as suspension cells grown in serum-free culture media. EB 66 cells display additional attractive growth characteristics such as a very short population doubling time of 12 – 14 h, a capacity to reach very high cell density (> 30 million cells/mL) and a unique metabolic profile resulting in low ammonium and lactate accumulation and low glutamine consumption, even at high cell densities. Furthermore, mAbs produced on EB 66 cells display a naturally reduced fucose content resulting in strongly enhanced ADCC activity. The EB 66 cells have therefore the potential to evolve as a novel cellular platform {{for the production of}} <b>high</b> <b>potency</b> <b>therapeutic</b> antibodies...|$|R

For site-specific PEGylation of LMB- 2, one cysteine residue was introduced into the peptide connector (ASGCGPE) between the Fv and the toxin. This mutant LMB- 2 (cys 1 -LMB- 2), which retained full cytotoxic activity, was then site-specifically conjugated with 5 or 20 kDa of polyethylene glycol-maleimide. When compared with unmodified LMB- 2, both PEGylated immunotoxins showed similar cytotoxic activities in vitro but superior stability at 37 °C in mouse serum, a 5 - to 8 -fold increase in plasma half-lives in mice, and a 3 - to 4 -fold increase in antitumor activity.

40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death worldwide and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) transplantation has been considered a promising therapy. Recently, it was reported that the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs is dependent on the age of the donor, yet the underlying mechanism has not been thoroughly investigated. This study was designed to investigate whether this impaired <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> is caused by an increased susceptivity of MSCs from old donors to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The MSCs were isolated from the subcutaneous inguinal region of young (8 – 10 weeks) and old (18 months) Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. By exposing these MSCs to H 2 O 2, we found that the adhesion of MSCs from old donors was damaged more severely. Specifically, decreased expression of integrin and reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase Src and FAK were observed. Furthemore, H 2 O 2 triggered an increased apoptosis of MSCs from old donors. To study the viability and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> of MSCs from young and old donors in vivo, these MSCs were transplanted into acute MI model rats. We observed a more rapidly decreased survival rate of the old MSCs in the infarct region, which may be caused by their increased susceptivity to the micro-environmental ROS, as transplantation of the old MSCs with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, protected them. The low viability of engrafted old MSCs consequently impaired their therapeutic effectiveness, judging by the histology and function of heart.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the anti-leukemia effect that is exerted by the murine anti-CD 7 antibody HB 2 in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and determined the contribution that this antibody effect makes to the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> of a saporin immunotoxin (IT) constructed with the same antibody. The anti-leukemia effect is not exerted through complement-mediated lysis or through direct growth-inhibitory signaling after binding of antibody to the CD 7 molecule on the T-ALL cell surface but rather through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Thus, the in vivo depletion of SCID mice of their natural killer cells almost completely abolishes the therapeutic effect of native HB 2 anti-CD 7 antibody and moreover significantly reduces the in vivo therapeutic performance of the anti-CD 7 HB 2 -SAPORIN IT. Furthermore, an IT constructed with the F(ab') 2 fragment of the same anti-CD 7 antibody (HB 2 -F(ab') 2 -SAPORIN), which is incapable of recruiting natural killer cells, performed significantly less well therapeutically than HB 2 -SAPORIN IT. There was also a significant improvement in the therapeutic performance of the HB 2 -F(ab') 2 -SAPORIN IT in SCID-HSB- 2 mice when used in combination with intact HB 2 antibody, presumably through restoration of an ADCC attack on the target HSB- 2 cell. These combined data indicate that ADCC in the SCID mouse does contribute additively together with toxin to the in vivo <b>therapeutic</b> <b>potency</b> of the HB 2 -SAPORIN IT directed against this human T-ALL cell line and that this has potentially important implications for the utility of this and other related classes of immunotherapeutic in human therapy...|$|R
