500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

[...] Speaking of the same encounter in a 2002 interview, Edward said, [...] "She told me I would one day become internationally known for my psychic abilities through lectures, books, radio and TV. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> full of it until she started to tell me things no one in my life knew about...

2500|$|Benson's {{band had}} a high {{turnover}} of musicians, as they frequently left to marry G.I.s they met while touring. She once commented, [...] "I lost seven in one year to America.

I like the way she moves on the court. She's very balanced". Bollettieri stated that Watson's [...] "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".|$|E
2500|$|In the George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill on 19 March, she again won at short odds, beating Kermadec {{by one and}} a half lengths. On 2 April, the filly started odds-on {{favourite}} for the A$3 million Doncaster Mile at Randwick despite carrying top {{weight in}} a fifteen-runner field on unsuitably soft ground. She looked unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight but broke through in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Happy Clapper. Waller commented, [...] "I'll call her a champion while I can speak. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> beaten at the half-mile. She must have an amazing will to win." ...|$|E
2500|$|Notably, Gurinder Chadha {{previously}} {{directed the}} film What's Cooking, which featured Julianna Margulies and Kyra Sedgwick as a lesbian couple.

2500|$|In 1975, Harris {{appeared}} {{in one of}} her signature film roles in Robert Altman's masterpiece Nashville, playing [...] "Albuquerque", a ditzy, scantily clad country singing hopeful who may be far more opportunistic and calculating than she would first appear. [...] Accounts of the film's chaotic and inspired production, particularly in Jan Stuart's book The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece, indicate a clash between actress and director. Harris earned a Golden Globe nomination (one of 11 for the film); as Oscar-nominated co-star Lily Tomlin put it, [...] "I was the hugest of Barbara Harris fan; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so stunning and original." [...] Although the two were set to reunite with Altman in a sequel, that film was never made.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, [...] "I loved Lisa. She was a great {{character}} and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and {{get out there and}} do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never!

I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in a bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because {{the pain in her}} feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
2500|$|BBC News {{claimed in}} 2000 that Tamzin Outhwaite {{was one of}} EastEnders most popular stars and Mel was {{described}} {{as one of the}} most popular characters on the show. During her stint it was reported that the BBC offered to increase her salary various times to entice her to stay with EastEnders with suggestions that she was the highest-paid British soap star. She was awarded 'Sexiest Female' at the British Soap Awards for three years running and 'Best Newcomer' at the National TV Awards. Outhwaite has discussed her popularity: [...] "When I came in as the vicar's sister, I had no idea Mel would be such a big character and the audience would take to her so quickly. I was surprised as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a bit plain and a flirt. But no matter what Mel does – going out with Ian, Dan, Steve, Phil – people still like her.
