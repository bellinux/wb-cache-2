By varying the monomer <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> over the micellar solution, an unexpected direct dependence of instantaneous conversion on the monomer <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> was found.

40|$|Context: Current {{treatment}} of paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning involves initiating a 3 -phase N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion after comparing a plasma concentration, taken ≥ 4 h post-overdose, to a nomogram. This {{may result in}} dosing errors, a delay in treatment, or possibly more adverse effects – due {{to the use of}} a high dose rate for the first infusion when treatment is initiated. Objective: Our aim was to investigate a novel dosing regimen for the immediate administration of NAC on admission at a lower infusion rate. Methods: We used a published population pharmacokinetic model of NAC to simulate a scenario where a patient presents to the hospital 2 h post-overdose. The conventional regimen is commenced 6 h post-overdose when the 4 -h plasma paracetamol concentration is available. We investigated an NAC infusion using a lower <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> initiated immediately on presentation. We determined a <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> that gave an area under the curve (AUC) of the concentration-time curve that was the same or greater than that from the conventional regimen on 90 % of occasions. Results: Lower dosing rates of NAC initiated immediately resulted in a similar exposure to NAC. An infusion of 110 mg/kg over the first 5 h (22 mg/kg/h) followed by the last two phases of the conventional regimen, or 200 mg/kg over 9 h (22. 6 mg/kg/h) followed by the last phase of the conventional regimen could be used. Conclusion: The novel dosing regimen allowed immediate {{treatment of}} a patient using a lower <b>dosing</b> <b>rate.</b> This greatly simplifies the current dosing regimen and may reduce NAC adverse effects while ensuring the same amount of NAC is delivered...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE To assess <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> in {{volumetric}} modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans. METHODS For <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> analysis, using Monte Carlo methods, dose distributions {{are calculated}} in sectors of consecutive DICOM control points and each multiplied with the MU-rate obtaining <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions for every voxel at every time-point during a treatment fraction. <b>Dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions {{were calculated for}} a clinical head and neck, cranial (2 Gy fraction dose) and a SBRT liver treatment case (5 Gy per fraction). To assess optimizer influence on <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions, five conventionally fractionated head and neck cases were optimized using the progressive resolution optimizer (PRO) versions 2 and 3 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). RESULTS Firstly, histograms of <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> {{over the course of}} treatment delivery in volumes of interest were generated for the PTV and spine or brainstem of the clinical treatment plans. Secondly, <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> were assessed as color wash overlay on top of CT slices, allowing the user to explore the <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> variation over time. For the cases considered, <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> were spread out over a continuous spectrum with a mean value in the lower half. PRO 3 generated plans showed higher maximum <b>dose</b> <b>rates</b> compared to PRO 2 (699. 80 cGy/min vs. 543. 46 cGy/min) and modulation of MU rates in blocks as opposed to gradual modulation. CONCLUSION Calculation and visualization of <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions in VMAT have been performed. <b>Dose</b> <b>rates</b> in clinical relevant VMAT cases are spread out over a continuous spectrum with a mean in the lower part for both conventional and SBRT test cases. Different optimization algorithms may lead to substantially different <b>dose</b> <b>rate</b> distributions in the same cases.

During four 8 -week trials, ozone {{was added to}} the system at a rate of 0. 025 or 0. 036 – 0. 039 kg ozone/kg feed fed. In the control, where no ozone was added, and in previously published research, BGD outbreaks occurred within two weeks of stocking, and these outbreaks generally required three to four chemotherapeutant treatments to prevent high mortality. In three of four trials where ozone was added to the system, BGD outbreaks were prevented without chemical treatments, but the causative bacterium, Flavobacterium branchiophilum, still colonized gill tissue. The one ozone test where BGD outbreaks required two chemical treatments coincided with a malfunction of the ozone generator. Although ozonation did reduce BGD mortality, it failed in all trials to produce more than a one log 10 reduction in numbers of heterotrophic bacteria in the system water or on gill tissue. Failure of the ozone to lower numbers of heterotrophic bacteria or to prevent the causative BGD bacterium from occurring on gills was attributed to the short exposure time to ozone residual (35 s contact chamber) and rapid loss of oxidation caused by levels of total suspended solids. Rationale for ozone's success at preventing BGD mortalities are not fully understood but may in part be due to improved water quality. Use of the lower ozone <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 025 kg ozone/kg feed) appeared to provide the same benefits as the higher <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 036 – 0. 039 kg ozone/kg feed fed); however, the lower ozone <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> was less likely to produce a toxic ozone residual in the culture tank and would also reduce ozone equipment capital and operating costs...|$|E

The chain length of the TG plays an {{important}} role in the oral bioavailability of the co-administered drug. Fatty acid (FA) chain-length specificity of porcine pancreatic lipase was studied by means of an in vitro lipolysis model under bio-relevant conditions at pH 6. 80. In order to determine the total extent of lipolysis, back-titration experiments at pH 11. 50 were performed. Results suggest that there is a specific chain length range (C 2 –C 8) for which pancreatic lipase shows higher activity. This specificity could result from a combination of physicochemical properties of TGs, 2 -monoglycerides (2 -MGs) and FAs, namely the droplet size of the TGs, the solubility of 2 -MGs within mixed micelles, and the relative stability of the FAs as leaving groups in the hydrolysis reaction.

Polymers used as flocculants in the {{secondary}} sludge dewatering process {{are one of the}} most expensive inputs in these plants. The disadvantage is that these polymers cannot be recycled. Currently, controlling of polymer <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> is done by trial and error method. It has been shown that huge savings can be made by optimising the polymer dosing using rheological properties. It is not an easy task to optimise this process because of changing sludge characteristics on a daily, seasonal and annual basis. To try and optimise polymer dosing and polymer concentration, the variation in rheological properties needs to be understood first. The correlation between the process parameters and the rheological properties needs to be determined. There is currently no database of rheological properties of secondary wastewater sludge feeding belt filter presses available. To address these issues, a 12 week assessment of the rheological properties of the sludge feed to the belt filter press before and after conditioning in four wastewater treatment plants in Cape Town was conducted. The rheological properties were determined using an MCR- 51 rheometer with parallel plate geometry under controlled temperature. After concluding the assessment, a 3 -level Box-Behnken factorial trial was conducted at Plant K wastewater treatment plant to statistically analyse the correlation and/or interactions between the process parameters (sludge feed flow rate, polymer dosing concentration, polymer <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> and belt press speed) and the rheological properties of the sludge to optimise the plant performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Drinking water {{contaminated}} by microorganisms {{can be a}} major risk to public health. Disinfection is used to destroy microorganisms that are potentially dangerous to humans. In order to prevent bacterial regrowth, it is also desirable to maintain a disinfectant residual in the water distribution system. The most commonly used disinfectant is chlorine. If the <b>dosing</b> <b>rate</b> of chlorine is too low, there may be insufficient residual {{at the end of}} the distribution system, resulting in bacterial regrowth. On the other hand, the addition of too much chlorine can lead to customer complaints about taste and odour, corrosion of the pipe network and the formation of potentially carcinogenic by-products. Consequently, in order to determine the optimal chlorine <b>dosing</b> <b>rate,</b> it is necessary to be able to predict chlorine decay in the network. In this paper, two data-driven techniques, namely linear regression models and multi layer perceptron artificial neural networks, are used to predict chlorine concentrations at two key locations in the Hope Valley water distribution system, which is located to the north of Adelaide, South Australia. A 5 -year data set containing routinely measured parameters is used for model development and validation. The results obtained indicate that both techniques are relatively successful in predicting chlorine concentrations in the distribution system. This is despite the fact that there is no hydraulic model of the system and that only data that were collected on a routine basis are used for model development. Overall, the performance of the multi layer perceptron is slightly better than that of the regression model, suggesting the presence of some non-linearities in the underlying physical processes governing chlorine decay...|$|E
