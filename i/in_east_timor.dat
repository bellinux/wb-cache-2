5|$|The 2nd Commando Regiment, {{then known}} as 4 RAR (Cdo), was {{deployed}} {{as a part of}} the United Nations Transitional Administration <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor,</b> 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit. The battalion took official control over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.|$|E

5|$|East Timor's {{ballot in}} favour of {{independence}} after 24 years of Indonesian occupation on 30 August 1999 resulted {{in a wave of}} violence by militia groups and pro-integration factions within the Indonesian military. 2, 3 and 5/7 RAR were subsequently deployed from 20 September 1999 as part of the UN-sanctioned International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), charged with restoring peace and overseeing the Indonesian departure. Despite minor clashes, including a contact at Motaain on the Indonesian border on 10 October 1999, control was quickly established and INTERFET handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNTAET) in February 2000. At this time, 5/7 RAR become the first battalion of the regiment to serve under UN command since the Korean War. From 1999 to 2004, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5/7, and 6 RAR would all serve <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> twice, giving the regiment a wealth of operational experience. One soldier was accidentally killed during these operations, while several more were wounded. Two years after being withdrawn, the deteriorating situation in the country—by then known as Timor Leste—again saw units of the regiment deployed to conduct stabilisation and security operations, this time under Operation Astute. In response to the initial crisis, 3 RAR was deployed along with special forces from 4 RAR (Commando) and the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in May 2006. It was replaced in early September by a combined Australian and New Zealand battle group based on 6 RAR, designated the ANZAC Battle Group. Subsequent rotations included elements of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8/9 RAR in the years that followed. After a phased drawdown, the last elements were withdrawn in 2013. Events <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> largely overshadowed developments in Solomon Islands, where elements of the regiment also served periodically from 2003 onwards. One member of the regiment died during operations in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E
