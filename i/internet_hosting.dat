In June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten, FreeBSD three of ten, and Microsoft two of ten; since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, FreeBSD two of ten, and Microsoft one of ten.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, {{many of the}} DOS-based BBSes {{had begun}} {{switching}} to modern multitasking operating systems, such as OS/2, Windows 95, and Linux. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was Excalibur BBS with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led {{to one of the}} earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include <b>Internet</b> <b>hosting</b> capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as Synchronet, Mystic BBS, EleBBS, DOC or Wildcat! BBS, provide access using the Telnet protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a FOSSIL-to-Telnet redirector such as NetFoss.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLocation-aware {{applications}} {{require a}} geographic location service of <b>Internet</b> <b>hosts.</b> We {{focus on a}} measurement-based service for the geographic location of <b>Internet</b> <b>hosts.</b> Host locations are inferred by comparing delay patterns of geographically distributed landmarks, which are hosts with a known geographic location, with the delay pattern of the target host to be located. Results show a significant correlation between geographic distance and network delay that can be exploited for a coarse-grained geographic location of <b>Internet</b> <b>hosts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} dealing with <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> {{localization}} methods, more exactly with determining geographical position of the unknown <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> connected to the network using RTT delay measuring. The first part {{is dealing with}} description of RTT delays that may occur in the network and tools for their measurement. The next is part of thesis is devoted to description of two kinds of localization methods. Ones that are using existing data to determine the position of <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> also called passive methods, and others that are using RTT delay measurement, also called active methods. The main part is focused on GeoWeight method {{which is based on}} geographical localization estimation of <b>Internet</b> <b>host.</b> It is based on RTT delay measurement using the principles of CBG method, enhanced by introduction of the theory of weights according to the probability of the target <b>Internet</b> <b>host.</b> The last part is describing the application that was made to determine the geographic localization of the target <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> using GeoWeight method. The application was afterwards tested by measuring RTT delay in PlanetLab experimental network. At the end the final measured results were compared with other localization methods (CBG, Octant, SOI, GeoIP) ...|$|R
