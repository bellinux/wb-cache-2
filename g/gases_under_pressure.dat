5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure,</b> buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, any diver who has breathed <b>gas</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> at any depth who {{surfaces}} unconscious, loses consciousness soon after surfacing, or displays neurological symptoms within about 10 minutes of surfacing should {{be assumed to}} be suffering from arterial gas embolism.|$|R
50|$|A gas {{generator}} is a chemical device that burns {{to provide a}} supply of <b>gas</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure.</b> Although still hot, comparable to rocket motor exhaust, this gas can be cooler and cleaner of particulates than rocket efflux. Both solid and liquid-fuelled {{gas generator}}s may be used.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{breathing}} <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> or containing helium causes problems in intelligibility of diver speech due to distortion {{caused by the}} different speed of sound in the gas and different density of the gas compared to air at surface pressure. These parameters induce changes in the vocal tract formants, which affect the timbre, and a slight change of pitch. Several studies indicate that the loss in intelligibility is mainly due to {{the change in the}} formants. Change of the speed of sound is relatively large in relation to depth increase at shallower depths, but this effect reduces as the pressure increases, and at greater depths a change in depth makes a smaller difference.|$|E
500|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties {{from those of}} air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction. Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult. [...] Human hearing underwater, {{in cases where the}} diver’s ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air. Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most. [...] The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure. Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it. The increased density of breathing <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> has a similar and additive effect.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{underwater}} habitats {{have been}} designed, built and used {{around the world}} since the early 1960s, either by private individuals or by government agencies. They have been used almost exclusively for research and exploration, {{but in recent years}} at least one underwater habitat has been provided for recreation and tourism. Research has been devoted particularly to the physiological processes and limits of breathing <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure,</b> for aquanaut and astronaut training, as well as for research on marine ecosystems.|$|E

50|$|Pressure swing {{adsorption}} (PSA) is {{a technology}} used to separate some gas species from {{a mixture of}} <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> according to the species' molecular characteristics and affinity for an adsorbent material. It operates at near-ambient temperatures and differs significantly from cryogenic distillation techniques of gas separation. Specific adsorptive materials (e.g., zeolites, activated carbon, molecular sieves, etc.) are used as a trap, preferentially adsorbing the target gas species at high pressure. The process then swings to low pressure to desorb the adsorbed material.|$|E
50|$|Corrugated hoses {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. Corrugated hoses are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.|$|E
50|$|On 18 September 2014, Gabr {{started his}} World Record dive {{with the help}} of H2O Divers in Dahab; a team of 30 individuals, {{including}} 9 divers as well as technicians, medical staff, and media representatives. The dive started at 10:30 on Thursday; while the descent took only 15 minutes, the ascent took 13 hours 35 minutes and he finally surfaced on Friday at 00:20. The slow ascent (decompression stops) is designed to mitigate the harmful effect caused by breathing different <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure.</b> Other than air, Gabr inhaled different mixes of nitrogen, oxygen and helium (Trimix), each with its own risk factor (nitrogen narcosis, decompression sickness, and oxygen toxicity) that could be fatal in many cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} a new cryopreservation method using xenon, a clathrate-forming <b>gas,</b> <b>under</b> medium <b>pressure</b> (100 psi). The {{objective of}} the study was to determine whether this cryostasis protocol could protect cardiac mitochondria at cryogenic temperatures (below 100 degrees Celsius). We analyzed transmission electron microscopy images to obtain information about changes in mitochondrial morphology induced by cryopreservation of the hearts. Our data showed absence of mitochondrial swelling, rupture of inner and outer membranes, and leakage of mitochondrial matrix into the cytoplasm after applying this cryostasis protocol. The electron microscopy results provided the first evidence that a cryostasis protocol using xenon as a clathrate-forming <b>gas</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> may have protective effects on intracellular membranes. This cryostasis technology may find applications in developing new approaches for long-term cryopreservation protocols...|$|R
5000|$|The {{physiology}} {{behind the}} off-gassing of nitrogen or helium {{absorbed by the}} body from breathing <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> has never been definitively established, particularly {{in relation to the}} formation of bubbles in the body's tissues, and a number of different algorithms have been developed over the years, based on simplified hypotheses of gas transport and absorption in body tissues, modified to fit empirical data, to predict the rate of off-gassing {{to reduce the risk of}} decompression sickness in divers to an acceptable level. However, these models do not describe the individual physiology of the diver accurately: divers have been known to suffer symptomatic decompression sickness whilst diving within the limits of dive tables or dive computers (sometimes referred to as an [...] "undeserved hit"), and divers have exceeded No Decompression Limits but remained asymptomatic.|$|E

5000|$|Conshelf Two, {{the first}} ambitious attempt {{for men to}} live and work on the sea floor, was {{launched}} in 1963. In it, a half-dozen oceanauts lived 10 m down in the Red Sea off Sudan in a starfish-shaped house for 30 days. The undersea living experiment also had two other structures, one a submarine hangar that housed a small, two-man submarine referred to as the [...] "diving saucer" [...] for its resemblance to a science fiction flying saucer, and a smaller [...] "deep cabin" [...] where two oceanauts lived at a depth of 30 m for a week. They {{were among the first to}} breathe a mixture of helium and oxygen, avoiding the normal nitrogen/oxygen mixture which when breathed under pressure can cause narcosis. The deep cabin was also an early effort in saturation diving, in which the aquanauts' body tissues were allowed to become totally saturated by the helium in the breathing mixture, a result of breathing the <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure.</b> The necessary decompression from saturation was accelerated by using oxygen enriched breathing gases. They suffered no apparent ill effects.|$|E

40|$|Storage of <b>gases</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{including}} hydrogen, is {{a well-known}} technique. However the use in vehicles of hydrogen at pressures much higher than those applicable in natural gas cars still requires safety and performance studies {{with respect to the}} verification of the existing standards and regulations. The JRC-IE has developed a facility, GasTeF, for carrying out tests on full-scale high pressure vehicle’s tanks for hydrogen or natural gas. Typical tests performed in GasTeF are static permeation measurements of the storage system and hydrogen cycling, in which tanks are fast filled and slowly emptied using hydrogen pressurised up to 70 MPa, for at least 1000 times according to the requirements of the EU regulation on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles. Moreover the temperature evolution of the gas inside and outside the tank is monitored using an ad-hoc designed thermocouples array system. This paper reports the first experimental results on the temperature distribution during hydrogen cycling tests. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|E
