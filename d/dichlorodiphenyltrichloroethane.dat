Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordane compounds (CHLs), and <b>dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes</b> (DDTs) were the most frequently detected OCPs in air and water. Air-water exchange was mainly characterized by net volatilization for all measured OCPs.

We found that the plume of the large contaminated river can serve as a significant regional secondary atmospheric source of legacy contaminants released in the catchment. In particular, the sediment plume represented the relevant source of DDT compounds (especially p,p'-DDE) sustaining net degassing when clean air masses from the open ocean reached the plume area. In contrast, a mass balance showed that, for HCHs, contaminated river discharge (water and sediment) plumes were capable of sustaining volatilization throughout the year.

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{have been}} a major environmental issue, attracting much scientific concern because of their nature of toxicity, persistence, and endocrine disrupting effects. Soil samples were collected from ten college school yards in Beijing in 2006 and analyzed to determine fifteen OCPs. <b>Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes</b> (DDTs) were found to be the main pollutants, accounting for 93. 70 % of total OCPs, followed by hexachlorohexanes (HCHs) (2. 25 %) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (1. 82 %). Content of chlordanes (CHLs), heptachlors (HEPTs), and endosulfans comprised 0. 51 %, 1. 05 %, and 0. 79 % of fifteen OCPs, respectively. The preliminary pollution assessment indicated that DDTs have caused high OCPs levels in some schools. Source identification showed that HCHs in soils were originated from an old mixed source of technical HCHs and lindane. And DDTs were mainly from mixed use of technical DDTs and dicofol containing DDT impurities. According to GB 15618 - 1995 (guidelines of Chinese environmental quality standards for soils), HCHs and DDTs levels might be categorized as little and low polluting pesticides.

Thus, OCPs in edible fish species (Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, Carassius spp., and Clarias gariepinus) from Lake Ziway, an Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake were investigated to assess the potential human health hazards of these contaminants. <b>Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes</b> (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, and heptachlors were observed with Sigma OCPs concentration ranging from 1. 41 to 63. 8 ng g(- 1) ww. DDTs were the predominant contaminants (0. 9 to 61. 9 ng g(- 1) ww), followed by HCHs. The predominance of DDTs may be attributed to their current use in vector control and contamination from past usage. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of OCPs from all fish species were much lower than the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), indicating that consumption of fish is at little risk to human health at present. However, the cancer risk estimates in the area of concern and the hazard ratios (HRs) of HCHs, DDTs, and heptachlors exceeded the threshold value of one, indicating daily exposure to these compounds is a potential concern.

The net atmospheric flux to the soil suggests that the levels of HCHs and DDTs in soil are dominated by atmospheric deposition and the urban soil in Beijing would be a sink for HCHs and DDTs in the long term.

The oxidised CNTs were successfully decorated with Zero-Valent (ZV) Fe/Ni nanoparticles for the adsorption and degradation studies of polychlorinated organic pollutants (in {{this case the}} <b>dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes</b> (DDTs)). The in situ modification procedure was carried out using different quantities (0. 04 wt%, 0. 1 wt% and 0. 2 wt%) of Fe/Ni-f-CNTs nanohybrids dispersed in a DMAc solution and dipping the polyethersulfone powder into a suspension containing the Fe/Ni-f-CNTs to form a nano-composite membrane. The formed composite membrane characteristics were investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The incorporation of nanohybrid in the PES membrane was found to increase the surface smoothness and the hydrophilicity of the composites. In addition, {{there was an increase}} in the adsorption of DDTs with increase in the nano-hybrid loading as indicated by the adsorption studies using the Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm studies. The data obtained from the batch studies closely fitted with the Langmuir isotherm based on the characteristic parameter RL found to lie within the standard range 0 < RL < 1...|$|R
