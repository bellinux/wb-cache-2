It is devoted to examining a number of patterns of representation especially as they pertain to the notion of counter discourse and counter-hegemonic modalities of resistance and subversion. It also inspects the discursive mechanisms Akbib employs to represent America and highlights how Western cultural prejudices and stereotypes are destabilised, and how the discursively-inflected distortions of the Orientalist mindset are disturbed in his work. The choice of this text is determined by a strong desire to discover how the Other of the Orientalist ideology examines and understands the Western Self and modernity and how he/she dismantles “the Centre/Margin binarism of imperial discourse. ...|$|R

40|$|Imagine for {{a moment}} that you are not a Goethe scholar, and {{consider}} these questions: Why read Goethe, or his contemporaries, for that matter? Is it worth the time and effort required? Are there not more relevant issues deserving of our attention? It is the year 2011 after all. What might we learn from this fellow Goethe that we don’t already know? With the ever-increasing pressure on educators in the liberal arts, in general, and Germanists, more specifically, to make a case for their continued existence, these are deadly serious questions. They require answers that are accessible to an audience who may not be familiar with Goethe or his Age. While reading Goethe’s Modernisms, I was contemplating career options other than teaching German language, literature, and culture at an institution of higher learning—not by choice, mind you. What transferable skills do I possess? Where does one start? What is a Goethe scholar to do? As I have taught numerous courses dealing with the Goethezeit, I am used to discussing with students the relevance of this time period, its texts, and its contexts for contemporary life—all of which I take great pleasure in doing. However, speaking with motivated, self-selecting students about this is one thing. Justifying to administrators—provided that is even an option—the value of such discussions is quite another. What might all {{this have to do with}} Goethe’s Modernisms? A great deal, I contend. Astrida Tantillo, President of the Goethe Society of North America as well as Interim Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has written a book that addresses many of the questions I posed above. In it she presents nuanced readings of Faust, Werther, and the Wilhelm Meister novels that have much to offer to Goethe studies. At the same time, her analyses are framed by the broader issue of Goethe’s contribution to and critique of modernity, with a particular <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>America...</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theories}} on {{the origins of}} crises put lending booms at the root of financial collapses. Yet lending booms may be a natural consequence of economic development and fluctuations. So, are lending booms dangerous? In this Paper, we investigate this question empirically using a broad sample of lending boom episodes over 40 years, with a special <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Latin <b>America.</b> Our results indicate that: (1) lending booms are often associated with (i) a domestic investment boom, (ii) an increase in domestic interest rates, (iii) a worsening of the current account, (iv) a decline in reserves, (v) a real appreciation, and (vi) a decline in output growth; (2) lending booms typically do not substantially increase the vulnerability of the banking sector or the balance of payments. <b>On</b> comparing Latin <b>America</b> {{and the rest of the}} world, we find that Latin American lending booms make the economy considerably more volatile and vulnerable to financial and balance-of-payment crises than is the case in other regions.

40|$|The {{leading role}} that China {{has been gaining}} in world {{commerce}} has had {{a great impact on}} global economy, and of course, on the economies of Latin American countries. It is not risky to say that China has seriously laid <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Latin <b>America,</b> not only as a market for its manufactured products, but as an important source of raw material for its industries, and food for its population. Currently, China grants Latin America a privileged place as part of its relationships with the developing world. For the Asian country, the insertion in this region is part of the building process and accumulation of the power developed in the frame of the Pacific strategy as a rising world power. A closer relation strengthens its influence upon it, traditionally dominated by the United States. The loss of political influence and capacity of the United States to impose a world agenda is one of the parameters upon which China designs its politics towards Latin America. A tight evaluation of the political reality shows that Latin-American countries tend to design more independent foreign politics than Washington, thu...|$|R
5000|$|Historical documentaries, {{such as the}} {{landmark}} 14-hour <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> the Prize: <b>America's</b> Civil Rights Years (1986—Part 1 and 1989—Part 2) by Henry Hampton, Four Little Girls (1997) by Spike Lee, and The Civil War by Ken Burns, UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery 500 Years Later, expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as The Thin Blue Line by Errol Morris incorporated stylized re-enactments, and Michael Moore's Roger & Me placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as [...] "mondo films" [...] or [...] "docu-ganda." [...] However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.|$|R

5000|$|The Great Depression made {{overseas}} military expeditions {{too costly}} for the U.S. In January 1931 Henry Stimson, then Secretary of State, announced that all U.S. soldiers in Nicaragua would be withdrawn following the 1932 {{election in the}} country. The Good Neighbor policy was the foreign policy of the new administration of United States President Franklin Roosevelt toward the countries of Latin America.The United States wished to have good relations with its neighbors, especially {{at a time when}} conflicts were beginning to rise once again, and this policy was more or less intended to garner Latin American support. Giving up unpopular military intervention, the United States shifted to other methods to maintain its influence in Latin America: Pan-Americanism, support for strong local leaders, the training of national guards, economic and cultural penetration, Export-Import Bank loans, financial supervision, and political subversion. The Good Neighbor Policy meant that the United States would keep its <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> Latin <b>America</b> in a more peaceful tone. On 4 March 1933, Roosevelt stated during his inaugural address that: [...] "In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others." [...] This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. Hull said: [...] "No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another" [...] (LaFeber, 376). This is apparent when in December of the same year Roosevelt again gave verbal evidence of a shift in U.S. policy in the region when he stated: [...] "The definite policy of the United States from now on is one opposed to armed intervention." ...|$|R
