5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} tell you something… and I think it's {{affected}} my whole life, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can tell it very well, but I've thought about it a lot of times.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hall's {{cinematography}} and {{the thematic}} use of water. He, too, felt an emotional detachment from the characters, saying, [...] "I knew I admired it, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> liked it... It {{is cold and}} holds us outside." ...|$|E
500|$|Levine {{stated that}} he {{believed}} the band was reaching its peak and may make one more album before disbanding.

500|$|In August 2016, Lochte {{was charged}} with {{providing}} a false claim of a robbery during the 2016 Olympic Games, and if convicted could be jailed up to 18 months. On August 30, 2016, when appearing on Good Morning America, {{he said that he}} was unsure if he would claim the incident, which fulfills the requirements of [...] "armed robbery" [...] under Brazilian law, as a robbery saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would consider it as a robbery, or extortion, or us just paying up for the poster being ripped." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{publication}} of William Wharton's 1978 novel Birdy, Alan Parker received galley proofs {{of the book}} from his agent, who advised him that the novel {{was going to be}} optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. Parker explained, [...] "So much of the story happened inside the boy's head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could make the jump." [...] In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000.|$|E
500|$|The seven-track live {{record was}} {{recorded}} {{in front of a}} room full of people in New York City in the autumn of 1984. It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should tell you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even if perhaps the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the eight}} days {{following}} the announcement, the page operated as it normally did. After reconsidering several times, the administrator decided to keep maintaining the page, and thanked the media and his followers for supporting him. He concluded by saying, [...] "I am not sure if keeping this page will benefit the people of goodwill ... only God will <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was irresponsible or stubborn in doing so ... On another note, I confess {{that it has been}} an honor and pleasure to continue collaborating and working as a team with all of you. Thank you, people of goodwill from Tamaulipas.

2500|$|When Wild {{joined the}} solar group {{there were two}} teams from which to choose.

500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to play football anymore. Because I just, I felt like that I would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, {{with more than}} 1,000 people in {{attendance}} at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the crowd: [...] "The real heroes didn't come home." [...] Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits {{in the game and}} earned a win in the Indians' 4–2 victory. [...] "I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could finish the game", Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50ERA.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E

500|$|Ram Charan {{decided not}} to debut in Bollywood with Magadheeras Hindi remake, as he {{believed}} the film might not be recreated well. In an interview with The Times of India, Charan said, [...] "When I met Anil Kapoor some time back, he told me I will ask Boney Kapoor to remake Magadheera with you in Hindi. But I said I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would want to do}} the remake. Magadheera is a lovely film which can't be recreated."

500|$|In 2003, Youkilis {{started the}} season with the Portland Sea Dogs. In 94 games, he led the Eastern League with a [...]487 on-base {{percentage}} (best all-time for the team through 2007), and was third in the league with a [...]327 batting average (second-best all-time for the team through 2007). Later, he earned {{a spot on the}} Eastern League All-Star team, the Baseball America AA All-Star team, and on the U.S. roster for the 2003 All-Star Futures Game. After Portland, Youkilis moved up to play for the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Boston Red Sox Class-AAA franchise. During his time with Pawtucket, Youkilis managed to complete a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate Kevin Millar's minor-league record for consecutive games reaching base. His 104 walks were the third-highest number recorded in the minors in 2003. Asked, however, about the focus in position-playing baseball on five-tool players, Youkilis quipped, [...] "I don't even <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have a tool." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his debut, the Philadelphia club {{retained}} several talented pitchers, including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs. Coveleski admitted that he [...] " [...] <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could have beat them out for a spot in the rotation." [...] After the 1914 season, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Connie Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics' rights expiring. Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the spitball; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used alum. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the Cleveland Indians purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916.|$|E

5000|$|Grove was on The Big Payoff {{for four}} years.

[...] She also appeared on such television programs as The Bert Parks Show, The Red Buttons Show and Ozark Jubilee.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> know the answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
