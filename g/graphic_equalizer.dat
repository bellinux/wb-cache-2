5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer</b> processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Crown {{patented}} the synergistic equalizer, {{releasing the}} stereo EQ-2 <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer</b> which used {{a combination of}} shelving filters and eleven active frequency adjustment faders per channel. The faders were connected to constant bandwidth, variable Q, 1/2-octave filters placed on octave centers but with adjustable frequency knobs to shift the center frequency for greater flexibility. A limited number of units were sold to audiophiles and audio researchers.|$|E
25|$|On the inside, this {{generation}} had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors {{as well as}} a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this year only went to 85mph (140km/h) in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control was standard in {{this generation}}. Toyota also included the retractable map light as standard. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with cassette. The optional cassette stereo featured a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer.</b> The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather was an option on L-types of this year, but P-types were limited to standard striped cloth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> {{used for}} tone control provide {{independent}} elevation or attenuation of individual bands of frequencies. Wide frequency range <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> of high resolution can provide elevation or attenuation in 1/3 octave bands spanning from approximately 30 Hz to 18 kHz.Parametric equalizers can control {{not only the}} amount of boost and cut but also the specific frequency at which the boost and cut takes place {{and the range of}} frequencies (bandwidth) affected.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> is their simplicity of use. When ringing the monitors, a person can boost then restore each frequency band until the ringing starts. [...] This helps you identify the feedback frequency. A drawback of <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> is the fixed frequency bands. Feedback rarely occurs on the exact center of the frequency band so two adjacent frequency bands may have to be reduced in parallel to eliminate the feedback.|$|R
50|$|Other well-received UREI {{products}} {{included the}} LA-4 electro-optical compressor limiter, the UREI Teletronix LA-3A electro-optical leveling amplifier and the 500-series UREI <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Typically, guitar {{amplifiers}} {{have two}} amplifying circuit stages {{and in addition}} frequently have tone-shaping electric circuits, which usually include at least bass and treble controls, which function similarly to the equivalent controls on a home hi-fi system. More expensive amplifiers typically have more controls for other frequency ranges, such as one or two [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] control for high frequencies. Some guitar amplifiers have a <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer,</b> which uses vertical faders to control multiple frequency bands. Some more expensive bass amps have a parametric equalizer, which enables precise control of tone.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest {{method of}} system {{calibration}} involves {{a set of}} healthy ears, test program material (i.e. music or speech), a <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer,</b> and last but certainly not least, a familiarity with the proper (or desired) frequency response. One must then listen to the program material through the system, take note of any noticeable frequency changes or resonances, and subtly correct them using the equalizer. [...] Experienced engineers typically use a specific playlist of music that they have become very familiar with every time they calibrate a new system. [...] This [...] "by ear" [...] process is still done by many engineers, even when analysis equipment is used, as a final check of how the system sounds with music or speech playing through the system.|$|E
2500|$|A simple, {{inexpensive}} amplifier {{may have}} only two tone controls, a passive bass and treble control. In some better quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, a number of mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid and high mid), and a <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer</b> or parametric equalizer. [...] The amplifier's master volume control restricts the amount of signal permitted through to the driver stage and the power amplifier. [...] When using a power attenuator with a tube amplifier, the master volume no longer acts as the master volume control. Instead, the power attenuator's attenuation control controls the power delivered to the speaker, and the amplifier's master volume control determines the amount of power-tube distortion. Power-supply based power reduction is controlled by a knob on the tube power amp, variously labeled [...] "wattage", [...] "power", [...] "scale", [...] "power scale", or [...] "power dampening".|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} broadband tactile sound, all {{channels are}} summed {{to provide a}} full range signal to the transducer amplifier. <b>Graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> {{can also be used}} to further modify the effect.|$|R
2500|$|Equalizers are {{electronic}} devices that allow audio engineers {{to control the}} tone and frequencies of the sound in a channel, group (e.g., all the mics on a drumkit) or an entire stage's mix. The bass and treble controls on a home stereo are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in pro sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for {{a whole range of}} bass and treble frequencies), <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> and parametric <b>equalizers.</b> <b>Graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> have faders (vertical slide controls) which together resemble a frequency response curve plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{equalizers}} in music production are parametric, semi-parametric, graphic, peak, and program <b>equalizers.</b> <b>Graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> are often included in consumer audio equipment and software which plays music on home computers. Parametric equalizers require more expertise than <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers,</b> {{and they can}} provide more specific compensation or alteration around a chosen frequency. This {{may be used in}} order to remove unwanted resonances or boost certain frequencies. An acoustic guitarist who finds that her instrument sounds too [...] "boomy" [...] may ask the audio engineer to reduce the low frequency range response, to correct this issue. A guitarist who finds that the instrument sound in the PA has too much finger noise may ask the engineer to reduce the higher frequency range response.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer</b> for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{application}} for a gyrator {{is to reduce the}} size and cost of a system by removing the need for bulky, heavy and expensive inductors. For example, RLC bandpass filter characteristics can be realized with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors. Thus <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> can be achieved with capacitors, resistors and operational amplifiers without using inductors because of the invention of the gyrator.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> {{and other}} {{equipment}} developed for improving fidelity have since been used by recording engineers to modify frequency responses for aesthetic reasons. Hence {{in the field of}} audio electronics the term [...] "equalization" [...] is now broadly used to describe the application of such filters regardless of intent. This broad definition therefore includes all linear filters at the disposal of a listener or engineer.|$|R

50|$|He {{obtained}} a master's degree {{in electrical engineering}} from Delft University in 1923, and joined the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (Philips Physics Laboratory) in Eindhoven. In 1926, he (and Gilles Holst) invented the pentode vacuum tube. The gyrator was invented by him around 1948. The gyrator is useful to simulate the effect of an inductor without using a coil. For example, it is used in hi-fi <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers.</b> He held 41 US patents.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of using parametric equalizers in a monitor {{system is that}} the filter can be exactly adjusted to the specific feedback frequency, and the bandwidth of the filter can be set to be very narrow so the adjustment affects as little of the frequency band as possible. This leads to more precise feedback elimination with less coloring of the sound. For this reason many professionals recommend using parametric <b>equalizers</b> over <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> for monitors.|$|R
40|$|A straight-forward {{design of}} <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizers</b> with minimumphase {{behavior}} based on recently developed higher-order bandshelving filters is presented. Due {{to the high}} filter order, the gain in one band is almost completely independent from the gain in the other bands. Although no special care will be taken to design filters with complementary edges except for a suitable definition of the cut-off frequencies, the resulting amplitude deviation in the transitional region between the bands will be sufficiently low for many applications. 1...|$|R

5000|$|A {{variation}} on the <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer</b> is a [...] "cut only" [...] <b>graphic</b> <b>equalizer.</b> Since most of the time, monitor equalization involves the removing of frequencies, a cut only equalizer can give you more precise level adjustments since the entire travel of the slider is used for reducing the level rather than wasting half the travel for boost. An {{example of this is}} the UREI 539.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of sound that determine {{the perception of}} timbre include spectrum and envelope.
