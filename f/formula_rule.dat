5000|$|In proof theory, {{admissibility}} {{is often}} {{considered in the}} context of sequent calculi, where the basic objects are sequents rather than formulas. For example, one can rephrase the cut-elimination theorem as saying that the cut-free sequent calculus admits the cut rule(By abuse of language, it is also sometimes said that the (full) sequent calculus admits cut, meaning its cut-free version does.) However, admissibility in sequent calculi is usually only a notational variant for admissibility in the corresponding logic: any complete calculus for (say) intuitionistic logic admits a sequent rule if and only if IPC admits the <b>formula</b> <b>rule</b> which we obtain by translating each sequent [...] to its characteristic formula [...]|$|E

Burn injuries present difficult, diverse and varied challenge to medical and paramedical staff. The prognosis of a burn essentially depends on prompt and proper management. The ability to accurately evaluate and provide correct management is a must for all the health-care providers. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive burn management reference to all physicians and primary health-care providers.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a tire is modeled by using geometrically exact shells. The {{discretization}} {{is done with}} the help of isoparametric quadrilateral finite elements. The interpolation is performed with linear Lagrangian polynomials for the midsurface {{as well as for the}} director field. As time stepping method for the resulting differential algebraic equation a modified backward differential <b>formula</b> <b>rule</b> is chosen. To handle the interaction with a rigid road surface, a one sided normal contact formulation is introduced. An orthotropic material model for geometrically exact shells derived from 3 D continuum theory is introduced, to describe the anisotropic behavior of the tire material. Inflation pressure is taken into account with a configuration dependent force. The interaction between the multibody system of a car and the tire is realized via co-simulation. Some quasi-static simulations are presented and compared to measurements on a real tire...|$|E

40|$|Our goal is {{to assess}} how {{confident}} we can be in rules induced from training data, rather than propose how they should be induced in the first place. The standard confirmation-theoretic approach is rejected in favour of estimating the domain accuracies of rules. This is done in both the Classical and Bayesian paradigms. We account for the effect of noisy data. Some recent empirical results on the significance of compressive clauses are explained. Keywords: confirmation, machine learning, Classical estimation, Bayesian estimation, compression, significance, noise. 1 Confirmation Theory and Machine Learning Confirmation theory concerns the relation between three objects; a hypothesis, a set of evidence and background knowledge. The task is to measure the confirmation of the hypothesis by the evidence relative to the given background knowledge. Typically the hypothesis is some universal <b>formula</b> (<b>rule)</b> : H = 8 x : A(x) ! C(x) (1) the evidence is a finite set of ground atoms (facts), rele [...] ...|$|E
