40|$|A {{series of}} sled tests was {{conducted}} to examine the performance of booster seats under belt geometries representing the range found in the rear seats of current vehicles. Twelve tests were performed with the standard 6 YO Hybrid III ATD and 29 tests were performed with {{a modified version of}} the 6 YO ATD. The modified dummy has a pelvis with more realistic shape and flesh stiffness, a gel abdomen with biomechanically-based stiffness characteristics, and a custom neoprene jacket. Shoulder <b>belt</b> upper <b>anchorage</b> was set at the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> location and 64 mm inboard and outboard from this location. Lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations were chosen to span the range of lap belt angles permitted under FMVSS 210, using the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations and forward <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations that produce a much steeper lap belt angle. Four booster seats that provide a range of static belt fit were used. The ATDs were positioned using either the standard FMVSS No. 213 seating procedure or an alternate UMTRI procedure that produces postures closer to those of similar-size children. Kinematic results for the standard and modified dummies under the same test conditions were more similar than expected. The current version of the modified 6 YO is less sensitive to lap belt geometry than the prototype version of the dummy. The seating procedure had a greater affect on kinematic results. The UMTRI seating procedure produced greater knee-head excursion differences and less forward torso rotation than the FMVSS No. 213 procedure. Shifting the shoulder <b>belt</b> upper <b>anchorage</b> 128 mm laterally produced minimal variations in kinematics for a given booster seat/lap belt condition, likely because the belt-routing features of the booster seats limited the differences in static shoulder belt score to less than 10 mm. Moving the lap belt geometry from rearward (shallow angle) to forward (steep angle) produced less desirable kinematics with all booster seats tested. The forward position of the lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> allows greater forward translation of the booster and ATD before the belt engages the pelvis. Steeper belt angles are associated with better lap belt fit for children sitting without boosters, so designing rear seat belts for children who sit with and without boosters may involve a performance tradeoff...|$|R

As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, outboard seating positions of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|R

40|$|Obesity {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of some types of injury in crashes. One hypothesis is that obesity adversely effects belt fit by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying skeletal structures. To evaluate this hypothesis, belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and women, 48 percent of whom were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of upper and lower <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations and ranges of seat height, seat cushion angle, and seat back angle spanning a large fraction of current vehicle front and rear seats. In some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical situation in the second row of a small sedan. Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 -kg/m 2 was associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap belt webbing length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants. Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across a wide range of upper <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations, and the shoulder belt webbing length between the D-ring and latchplate increased by an average of 60 mm with each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI. The results suggest that obesity effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes...|$|R

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable seat <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint installation requirement to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder belt fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. <b>Belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. <b>Belt</b> upper <b>anchorage</b> (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder belt routing clip. The shoulder belt was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder <b>belt</b> with fixed <b>anchorages.</b> Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorages</b> leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper <b>anchorage</b> locations on <b>belt</b> restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R

The project of such components involves a structural test considering the action of dynamic forces arising from a crash scenario.

40|$|This {{research}} provides {{new insight}} into the nature, causes and costs of rollover casualties; and the economic benefits of basic countermeasures. The National Accident Sampling System (NASS) is {{a rich source of}} data on motor vehicle crashes, particularly if one goes beyond the electronic files. In this work, the author reviewed every NASS case from 2002 through 2004 in which a passenger car, SUV, pickup, or minivan that was less than eleven years old rolled over and produced an AIS 3 + injury (more than 500 cases). From this, we developed a useful new classification for these crashes with AIS 3 + injury: (1) cases with complete ejections, (2) cases in which there was a head or neck injury from roof crush, (3) other rollovers in which the rollover was the most harmful event, (4) cases in which a collision before the rollover was the most harmful event, and (5) cases in which a collision or major change in elevation during the rollover was the most harmful event. We used the NHTSA “Economic Impact of Motor Vehicle Crashes ” and the weighting factor for the crashes to determine the total cost of all of these crash injuries. We then estimated the effectiveness of three simple countermeasures – a strong roof, side window glazing that does not break out during the rollover, and an <b>effective</b> <b>belt</b> use reminder – in reducing the severity and cost of these injuries. The results were most dramatic for SUVs where the discounted potential savings were on the order of several thousand dollars per vehicle over its lifetime.

Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of rear seat occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the rear seat. For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their rear seat occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the rear seat. From the injury analysis, seating in the rear seat is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and rear seat. Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the rear seat provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the rear seats of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a three-point belt rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center rear seating position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the rear seat...|$|R

In recognition of the failures experienced by a significant number of business firms applying the limited concept of Total Quality Management Six Sigma has revolutionized the world of business and has presented a new measure of success in customer satisfaction and quality. Six Sigma uses an array of statistical and analytical tools to apply a data-driven, rootcause analysis to existing processes to minimize variation and aim for reducing defects to nearly elimination. The literature provides a perception of the historical development of quality management and enables an understanding of the primary elements of which TQM consists. It also provides a review of some of Six Sigma literature, as well as takes {{a closer look at the}} Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control, problem solving model of Six Sigma. The results of this research reflect the problems which appeared during the implementation of the primary TQM elements on the case study (Altawfig Soap Factory). The study, after covering the six sigma solutions, recommends applying Six Sigma due to its concentration on customer satisfaction, product design, departmental integration with quality, <b>effective</b> trainings (<b>belts</b> system), process control and improvement and Quality system improvements which expands to encompass all business options and adopt totality further than Total Quality Managemen...|$|R

The first {{result is that the}} effective temperature is the same at the poles and equator, in spite of the excess solar heat deposited at the equator.

The second result is that the <b>effective</b> temperature of <b>belts</b> is 3 to 4 K greater than that of zones.

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} performance of automotive child restraint systems (CRS) that conform to international proposals for a universal restraint concept to be adopted by both restraint and vehicle manufacturers. The concept is known as Isofix (International Standards Organisation FIXing), and is intended to ensure optimum compatibility and coupling between vehicle and CRS. In order to quantify {{the benefits of the}} proposed Isofix concept it has been necessary to establish the performance limits and benefits offered by current commercially available adult belt retained CRS. A considerable body of knowledge existed on the performance and limitations of the then current CRS. However, during 1995 a significant amendment was introduced affecting ECE R 44, the compliance standards applicable to CRS in Europe to which most rnanufacturers require their products to conform (separate national standards also exist). In 1995 amendment 03 was added to ECE R 44 and became a catalyst for considerable development activity by manufacturers of child restraints, that resulted in new or revised product ranges. These new products, in particular forward facing Group 1 (9 - 15 kg) child restraints have significantly improved dynamic performance in frontal impacts, notably in modern vehicles whose seat <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> positions have been optimised for restraint of adults, but are commonly less effective in restraining framed CRS. It was important therefore to re-assess existing systems as the baseline for a realistic evaluation of the proposed Isofix concepts (chapter 10). It was evident that, of the different Isofix concepts being proposed, no overall evaluation of their relative performance had, to that date, been undertaken. A programme involving the design and manufacture of not only suitable test equipment but, in a number of cases, prototype devices, was undertaken. The resulting data have formed the basis of input to the ISO Working Group 1, the body responsible for the evolution of the Isofix concept. This programme also highlighted a number of shortfalls in the proposed concepts. The major results of this test programme have been published at international level, and were used to inform the Isofix discussions. During the programme of comparative evaluation of not only the Isofix but the current belt retained devices, it became clear to the writer that in a frontal impact the orientation of the occupant with respect to the direction of travel had significance. A literature survey produced evidence of minimal research in this area. Hence it was decided by the writer to include a programme of parametric tests to investigate the significance of occupant orientation, given that commercially available CRS often include a feature to vary the recline angle of the seat. The Isofix set-up was particularly suitable for this exercise in that it eliminated many of the variables associated with belt retained devices. The results of this work have been published at intemationallevel. A review of the available accident data indicates that side impacts are potentially more life threatening than the more common frontal impacts due to the proximity of the occupant to an intruding vehicle or object. However, current European certification standards do not require the evaluation of CRS in a side impact. This is considered to be an area where improvements, particularly aided by an Isofix type attachment concept, can be made. Therefore the final area of research undertaken by the writer was to develop and propose a test to evaluate CRS in a realistic side impact scenario. This involved the simulation of not only the acceleration imparted to the target vehicle occupant but in addition the intrusion component. This work, which again has been presented at international level, contributed towards a proposal to amend the European certification standard for CRS to include a side impact evaluation. This thesis commences with a review of the accident data currently available, and looks at how the physiological and anatomical properties of the child, vehicle design, and the inherent potential for misuse and mis-installation of the current generation of CRS, impact upon child safety. This is followed by an overview of the lsofix proposal before the results of the writer's detailed testing of both current belt retained and proposed Isofix CRS concepts (chapters 10 and 11) are reported. The subsequent chapters (12 and 13) detail the results of the writer's investigation into CRS orientation in a frontal impact {{and the development of a}} representative side impact test, based on a single sled, for inclusion in the European certification procedure. The document concludes with discussion and conclusions relating to the future of CRS design and evaluation. The major findings of this research were: • contrary to initial expectations, significant CRS recline angle in a forward facing device has been proven to be undesirable; • Isofix CRS with rigid lower anchors have been shown to be beneficial, particularly in side impacts, their efficacy in a forward impact being compromised by rotation in devices that do not incorporate an anti-rotation device; • a side impact test has been developed which more accurately represents the input to a CRS seen in a rear vehicle incident. Such a test is not only desirable but essential to drive CRS manufacturers into improving side impact protection for occupants...|$|R
40|$|Three new {{results of}} the Pioneer 10 and 11 mission are discussed. The first is that {{effective}} temperature is the same at the poles and equator {{in spite of the}} large differences in solar energy deposition. This is consistent with theories of convection which suggest that an extremely small equator-to-pole temperature difference at the level of infrared emission could suppress the internal heat flux at the equator relative to the pole by an amount sufficient to balance the difference in solar energy deposition. The second result is that the <b>effective</b> temperature of <b>belts</b> is 3 to 4 K greater than that of zones, which is almost exactly accounted for by the lower albedo of belts. This result cannot be interpreted uniquely, but is consistent with a model in which the internal heat flux is the same under belts and zones, and the horizontal atmospheric heat flux is zero. The third observation provides evidence of instability along the south edges of zones in the northern hemisphere. These are the latitudes of minimum prograde velocity, where instability is most likely to occur in a barotropic fluid, as pointed out by Ingersoll and Cuzzi (1969). A more realistic baroclinic stability analysis suggests instability at these same latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{persons who}} {{report that they}} never wear a seat belt while driving or as a {{passenger}} with those who do in a nationally representative sample in the United States. Our guiding hypothesis is that failure to wear a seat belt {{is part of an}} antisocial behavior spectrum. Methods: Using public-use data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study employed binary logistic regression with adjustments for complex survey sampling to assess relationships between never wearing a seat belt and sociodemographic variables, antisocial behaviors, substance abuse and co-occurring problems, and criminal justice system contact. Results: Individuals who do not wear seat belts are younger, more likely to be male, less likely to be African American or Hispanic, have incomes of less than $ 75, 000, and be a high school or college graduate. After controlling for the effects of age, gender, race, income, education, and population density, individuals reporting that they never wear a seat belt while driving or as a passenger are more likely to report using alcohol and drugs (adjusted odds, 1. 61 e 2. 56), committing antisocial behaviors including felony offenses (adjusted odds, 2. 13 e 3. 57), and possess a dual diagnosis (adjusted odds, 1. 62 e 1. 73). Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-seat belt use is convergent with a spectrum of serious antisocial behavior and comorbid psychological distress. Importantly, results suggest that standard seat belt use policies and campaigns may not be <b>effective</b> for non-seat <b>belt</b> using individuals and a targeted approach may be needed.

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} problem of {{establishing}} {{the rule of law}} in the developing world. Democracies in the developing world have regular elections yet lack the rule of law. The solution, it is believed, is that these democracies must adopt the “best practices” of Western democracies by reforming judicial systems and strengthening constitutional judicial review. This argument rests on the view that new democracies lack the rule of law because political actors have the power to trump the legal system and the solution, therefore, is to strengthen the formal institutions that support judicial independence. The essay argues that this view is incomplete because it fails {{to take into account the}} difficulties that new democracies face in implementing the rule of law. These polities enjoy the “un-rule of law” where nearly all power is given one individual rather than the rule of law. The un-rule of law is not an aberration but a logical response to {{the problem of}} development. For a poor nation faced with a myriad of social and economic difficulties, the logical response is to give nearly all power to one individual to deal with those problems. Rule of law reforms often fail, therefore, because there is considerable political support for this concentration of power. The key to effectuating the rule of law lies not in adopting rules borrowed from developed democracies but in crafting a constituency for a legal system. Courts are the least dangerous branch. They lack power unless other actors are willing to implement judicial decisions. The reason why the rule of law has proven difficult to implement in the developing world is that there is little political support for the judicial system. Courts are marginal to the politics of developing nations. Developed nations, on the other hand, have effective mechanisms for implementing judicial decisions and political and economic actors, therefore, can use the courts to achieve their aims. Establishing the rule of law requires the construction of an <b>effective</b> transmission <b>belt</b> from courts to society. The rule of law requires crafting the proper linkages between courts and citizens rather than negating politics. The view that the developing world needs to borrow the best practices of the West and separate law from politics fails to comprehend the processes by which the rule of law becomes effectuated. Understanding the rule of law requires that we reverse the paradigm. It is not the developing world that needs to learn from the West but scholars in the developed world who need to study the un-rule of law...|$|R
