500|$|He {{joined the}} AAA Columbus Clippers for their playoffs. Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippers’ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about? He goes out and hits for the cycle.|$|E
500|$|Oliver's lack {{of medical}} ability drew several {{negative}} reviews. Referring to his [...] "cack-handedness", Simon {{described him as}} [...] "screwing up just about everything he touches" [...] upon {{his return to the}} AAU, a sentiment she repeated after Penny's death. Simon was left baffled when a professor of cardiology was offered the [...] "very best care possible" [...] – which resulted in Oliver treating him. She concluded: [...] " [...] begs the question, what's <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> at Holby being looked after by an F2?" [...] The Guardian Daniel Maier ridiculed Oliver's supposed talents, and jested that he was [...] "a doctor with the blue eyes of Fonda and the medical competence of fondue". One Daily Record columnist said that Oliver [...] "hoped to complete his training on the strength of his nice eyes and pretty".|$|E
500|$|That {{sense of}} {{crossing}} cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, {{at the heart}} of Blonde on Blonde: [...] " [...] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a test tube, and it just exploded." [...] For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: [...] " [...] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of [...] "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Arnold {{embarked}} on a second career that brought his music to a more diverse audience. In the summer of 1965, he had his first number-one country song in 10 years, [...] "What's <b>He</b> <b>Doing</b> in My World" [...] and struck gold again six months later with the song that [...] became his most well-known, [...] "Make the World Go Away", accompanied by pianist Floyd Cramer on piano and featuring the Anita Kerr Singers. As a result, Arnold's rendition became an international success. [...] "Make The World Go Away" [...] became his only top ten pop hit.|$|E
2500|$|Game 7 was a {{pitching}} duel between Bob Gibson and Mickey Lolich, pitching on only two days' rest. In a pre-game pep talk, Mayo Smith told his team that Gibson was not Superman, prompting Norm Cash to ask: [...] "What was <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> {{in a telephone}} booth changing his clothes?" [...] The game was scoreless after six innings, as the two pitchers dominated. In the 7th inning, the Tigers broke through on a triple by Jim Northrup that went over center fielder Curt Flood's head, driving in Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Curt Flood initially misread Northrup's hit, taking a step in, and then slipping as he chased the ball over his head. [...] Flood was tagged a [...] "goat" [...] for having misplayed the ball. The Tigers won Game 7 by a score of 4–1.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{very modest}} person, who insisted that even the {{ordinary}} plumber or electrician knows more about his craft than <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he could not}} explain how <b>he</b> <b>did</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on the field of play, and that he just followed his instincts.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the series}} {{does not have}} many lead characters, there are many {{recurring}} characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father [...] "split the show". Shiban noted that [...] "...the boys were looking for Dad, and {{they were looking for}} a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'" [...] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the series Grey's Anatomy. Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.|$|E
60|$|He instituted {{comparisons}} between her record and his own. He had found fault with her--so he mused--HE! And {{what could he}} say for himself? When she built her first church what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Gathering other blase multimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace with it; losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her first university, what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Polluting himself with a gay and dissipated secret life {{in the company of}} other fast bloods, multimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was building her first foundling asylum, what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Alas! When she was projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Ah, what, indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman with the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal bottle from the land, what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Getting drunk three times a day. When she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully welcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose which she had so honorably earned, what was <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.|$|E

He wasn't any Barker to be wet-nursed by Demorest.|$|E
