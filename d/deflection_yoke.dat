25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E
5000|$|The voltage {{applied to}} the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> is {{adjusted}} by various means (transformers, capacitors, center-tapped windings) so that the half-way voltage on the sawtooth's cliff is at the zero mark, meaning that a negative voltage will cause deflection in one direction, and a positive voltage deflection in the other; thus, a center-mounted <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> can use the whole screen area to depict a trace.

However, the entire structure of the cathode, <b>deflection</b> <b>yokes,</b> anode and overall vacuum tube size is much larger, therefore made out of steel, not glass, with the main central open midsection of the vacuum tube hollow, leaving room for the scan table and object or person to lie while the scan is performed.|$|R

50|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} output tubes in television sets (6CD6, 21LU8, etc.), usually {{due to a}} shorted coupling capacitor upsetting the bias or the driving oscillator operating well out of its design range. <b>Deflection</b> <b>yokes</b> are sometimes faulty.|$|R
50|$|FEDs {{eliminate}} much of {{the electrical}} complexity of Cathode Ray Tubes, including the heated filaments in the electron gun used to generate electrons and the electromagnets in the <b>deflection</b> <b>yokes</b> used to steer the beam, and are thus much more power efficient than a CRT of similar size. However, FED displays are technically worse than CRTs as they are not capable of multiscanning.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> was {{an advantage}} for naval use, where multiple displays were {{provided for the}} same radar set. By using the established technology of synchros and resolvers, stable slaved displays could be provided.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, wide-deflection-angle CRTs need {{horizontal}} sweeps {{with current}} that changes proportionally faster toward the center, because {{the center of}} the screen is closer to the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> than the edges. A linear change in current would swing the beams at a constant rate angularly; this would cause horizontal compression toward the center.|$|E
50|$|Hewlett-Packard made a large-screen fast vector monitor, {{which they}} called an X-Y display. It uses a {{wide-angle}} electrostatically-deflected CRT {{that is about}} as compact as a magnetic-deflection CRT.

The single phase spinel {{structure of the}} double sintered ferrites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD). The ferrite series was studied in terms of DC electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power in the temperature ranging from room temperature to 300 °C and 400 °C, respectively. It was observed that DC electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient α decreased {{with the increase in}} x. DC electrical conductivity was found to decrease by about 4 orders. All the compositions showed a negative Seebeck coefficient exhibiting n-type semiconducting nature. From the above experimental results, activation energy and mobility of all the samples were estimated. Small polaron hopping conduction mechanism was suggested for the series of ferrites. Owing to their low conductivity the nonstoichiometric MgCuZn ferrites are the best materials for transformer core and high definition television <b>deflection</b> <b>yokes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{methods of}} the target uniform {{irradiation}} by heavy ions have been analyzed. As a result the scanning system for the sup 8 sup 4 Kr sup 1 sup 5 sup + ion beam extracted from the cyclotron IC- 100 has been chosen and worked up. It consists of two deflecting yokes creating horizontal and vertical magnetic fields. The yokes are supplied by generators of saw-tooth current having the definitely fixed frequencies. When both generators work synchronously the centre of mass of the ion beam 'draws' a pattern on the target. The dimensions of the pattern cells {{are determined by the}} ratio of these frequencies. The correlation between the generator frequencies when heterogeneity of the particle density distribution does not exceed the required value of +- 5 % is obtained. It has been shown that for the moving target the chosen scanning scheme allows one to obtain its uniform density distribution. For the slow target velocities (20 - 50 cm/s) this scheme also allows one to compensate the collapse in the particle density distribution on the target when the protective beam interruption occurs on time up to 0. 3 s. The short description of the <b>deflection</b> <b>yokes</b> construction, their parameters, the scheme of the scanning generators and first results of their stand tests are presented...|$|R
40|$|Ferrite {{have found}} a variety of uses in {{electronic}} and communication engineering. Mn-Zn ferrites (Mn 1 -XZnxFe 2 O 4) are widely used as filter core materials over a range of frequencies varying from several hundred Hz to several MHz. There are many other applications such as in television receivers as <b>deflection</b> <b>yokes</b> and E. H. T. cores etc. The development of a ferrite suitable for a particular application is an interesting scientific problem and technological challenge. The properties of ferrites are determined {{by a number of}} intrinsic properties and their interaction with the ceramic microstructure. Impurities, present in or added to the raw materials used for processing ferrites, {{play an important role in}} determining the properties of the ferrites. The cost of ferrites is very much related to the purity level of the raw materials used. It is, therefore, both scientifically and economically important that the behaviour of ferrites is studied with additions of controlled amounts of impurities commonly present in the raw materials cheaply available. Silica (Si 0 2) is commonly found in the raw materials and is also, to some extent, contributed by atmospheric dust. In order to determine the tolerance of SiO 2 as an impurity in the raw materials and during processing, a systematic study has been carried out to investigate the effect of SiO 2 addition in the raw materials. The effect of controlled additions of oxides of germanium and tin to the raw materials has also been studied since Si, Ge and Sn are all elements of the IV group in the periodic table. The studies have been presented in five chapters. Chapter I gives the background essential for the present study. This chapter deals with the important properties of ferrites. The properties of ferrites can be classified in two categories. Firstly intrinsic properties i. e. those properties which are decided by the basic composition of the ferrite. Secondly extrinsic properties i. e. those properties which depend upon the microstructure and processing parameters. The literature presently available with special reference to impurities and their effect on the magnetic properties has also been discussed. The effect of impurities on the magnetic properties of ferrites depends upon whether they go in solid solution with the ferrite or stay insoluble. The nature of the three impurities - SiO 2, GeO 2 and SnO 2 in the ferrite has been studied in chapter II by employing scanning electron microscopy, X-ray and Auger microprobe and X-ray diffraction (lattice parameter measurement) techniques. Both. Si 0 2 and Ge 20 have been found to have a limited solubility in the ferrite and tend to segregate at the grain boundaries, Si 02 has been found to form a compound at the grain boundaries. Si-rich inclusions have also been detected in the grains at larger concentrations of Si 02 (1. 28 mol...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{deflection}} {{was used}} to produce the PPI display. The first design used two fixed sets of deflection yokes, {{at right angles to}} each other, and varying the drive signal to both of them by means of a goniometer. Later designs used the more conventional approach, where a single <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> was physically rotated, in synchronism with the antenna's rotation.|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, these (usually steady-rate) {{movements}} of the beams are called [...] "sweeps", and the circuits that create the currents for the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> (or voltages for the horizontal deflection plates in an oscilloscope) are called the sweep circuits. These create a sawtooth wave: steady movement across the screen, then a typically rapid {{move back to the}} other side, and likewise for the vertical sweep.|$|E
5000|$|Test {{patterns}} were also broadcast {{to the public}} daily to allow regular adjustments by home television set owners and TV shop repair technicians. In this regard, various features in the pattern were included to facilitate focus and contrast settings, and the measurement of resolution. The circular [...] "bulls-eyes" [...] in the centre and the four corners permitted uniform <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> and oscillator amplitude adjustments for centering, pincushioning, and image size.|$|E
50|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 {{monochrome}} unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob {{on the back of}} the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke.</b> This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke.</b> The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} magnetically deflected CRT, {{such as in}} a TV receiver or computer monitor, basically the vertical deflection coils are equivalent to coils wound around an horizontal axis. That axis is perpendicular to {{the neck of the}} tube; lines of force are basically horizontal. (In detail, coils in a <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> extend some distance beyond the neck of the tube, and lie close to the flare of the bulb; they have a truly distinctive appearance.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The ramp {{portion of}} the wave must appear as a {{straight}} line. If otherwise, it indicates that the voltage isn't increasing linearly, and therefore that the magnetic field produced by the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> is not linear. As a result, the electron beam will accelerate during the non-linear portions. This {{would result in a}} television image [...] "squished" [...] {{in the direction of the}} non-linearity. Extreme cases will show marked brightness increases, since the electron beam spends more time on that side of the picture.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) display, when the {{electron}} beams are unblanked, the horizontal deflection component of the magnetic field created by the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> makes the beams scan [...] "forward" [...] {{from left to right}} at a constant rate. The data for consecutive pixels goes (at the pixel clock rate) to the digital-to-analog converters {{for each of the three}} primary colors. (For modern flat-panel displays, however, the pixel data remains digital.) As the scan line is drawn, at the right edge of the display, all beams are blanked, but the magnetic field continues to increase in magnitude for a short while after blanking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the Vectrex was {{conceived}} by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late 1980. He, Mike Purvis, Tom Sloper, and Steve Marking had gone to Electro-Mavin, a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles. They found a 1" [...] cathode ray tube and considered if a small electronic game could be made of this. A demonstration of a vector-drawing cathode ray tube display was made by connecting the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material. An axillary yoke was used to keep the raster television's horizontal fly-back high-voltage system running. The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade, but as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers, it evolved into a tabletop with nine-inch screen.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{misconception}} {{that once a}} scan line is complete, a CRT display in effect suddenly jumps internally, by analogy with a typewriter or printer's paper advance or line feed, before creating the next scan line. As discussed above, this does not exactly happen: the vertical sweep continues at a steady rate over a scan line, creating a small tilt. Steady-rate sweep is done, instead of a stairstep of advancing every row, because steps are hard to implement technically, while steady-rate is much easier. The resulting tilt is compensated in most CRTs by the tilt and parallelogram adjustments, which impose a small vertical deflection as the beam sweeps across the screen. When properly adjusted, this deflection exactly cancels the downward slope of the scanlines. The horizontal retrace, in turn, slants smoothly downward as the tilt deflection is removed; there's no jump {{at either end of}} the retrace. In detail, scanning of CRTs is performed by magnetic deflection, by changing the current in the coils of the <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke.</b> Rapidly changing the deflection (a jump) requires a voltage spike to be applied to the yoke, and the deflection can only react as fast as the inductance and spike magnitude permit. Electronically, the inductance of the deflection yoke's vertical windings is relatively high, and thus the current in the yoke, and therefore the vertical part of the magnetic deflection field, can change only slowly.|$|E

40|$|This short {{communication}} concerns {{identification of}} the number of magnetic correction shunts and their positions for <b>deflection</b> <b>yoke</b> tuning to correct the misconvergence of colours of a cathode ray tube. The misconvergence of colours is characterised by the distances measured between the traces of red and blue beams. The method proposed consists of two phases, namely, learning and optimisation. In the learning phase, the radial basis function neural network is trained to learn a mapping: correction shunt position changes in misconvergence. In the optimisation phase, the trained neural network is used to predict changes in misconvergence depending on a correction shunt position. An optimisation procedure based on the predictions returned by the neural net is then executed in order to find the minimal number of correction shunts needed and their positions. During the experimental investigations, 98 % of the deflection yokes analysed have been tuned successfully using the technique proposed...|$|E
