The effect on poverty reduction is computed by taking into account country-specific and time-varying income-growth elasticity of poverty. The ICOR method suggests that the average annual rate of poverty reduction over the period 2000 - 2010 could have been 1. 9 percentage points higher. The capital stock method generates an additional 2. 5 percentage points per year above the current rate of poverty reduction. The evidence in this paper confirms that capital flight ha...|$|E
40|$|Saving, the {{fraction}} of national income that is not spent on current consumption, has long been widely regarded as {{a key factor in}} economic growth. ' The saving rate along with the <b>incremental</b> <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> determine the growth rate of the economy in the Harrod-Domar Model framework. The critical role of saving in capital accumulation and economic development is also recognised in the "two-gap" and classical growth models. For capital accumulation to result in sustained growth, it must be supported by adequate domestic/national savings. This has been clearly demonstrated by the extra-ordinary performance of the East Asian economies. While there have been brief periods of significant inflow of external financial resources to some developing countries in the past, foreign savings cannot be expected to provide a sustainable basis for financing domestic investment. Raising national saving rate is particularly essential to developing countries with a heavy debt service burden and limited capacity to obtain loans in foreign capital markets. The 1995 Mexican crisis showed, among other things, that low domestic savings can raise the probability of sudden capital outflows, and sharpen their negative consequences. In a financially integrated world, high national/domestic savings contribute to macro economic stability which is itself a powerful growth factor. Indeed, any macro economic adjustment programmes oriented to the resumption of long-run growth invariably emphasise the need to expand domestic savings. ...|$|E

This process objectively leads to the integration of social production and to increased interdependence between the rates and effectiveness of development of branches in the national economy.

As we know, each unit of output entails the fixed productive capital not only of a given branch but of many related branches as well. Moreover, as a rule, the amount of necessary capital in the related branches far exceeds the amount of necessary capital in the branch directly engaged in the production of a given product. For example in the USSR automotive industry in 1966, the direct <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> was 0. 36 rubles for every ruble's worth of output, while the total <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1. 52 rubles, i. e., 4. 2 times greater. ...|$|R

In this paper, we assess the role of cross-country differences in barriers to entry. This is motivated by the recent evidence about both their prevalence in the third world and their harmful economic consequences. We construct a growth model with capital in which barriers to entry give monopoly power to insider groups and allow them to extract rents. Our first contribution is to solve the dynamic rent-seeking problem of the insider groups and show that larger barriers reduce TFP, the <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio,</b> and per-capita GDP and increase the relative price of capital. In other words, our model is consistent with the evidence that poorer countries have lower TFPs and <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratios</b> and higher relative prices of capital. Our second contribution is to take our model to the data and assess quantitatively the aggregate implications of barriers to entry. Our most important finding is that barriers to entry have non-linear effects: while small to medium-sized barriers are harmful, large barriers can have disastrous quantitative effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Under modern conditions, {{the scale}} of the means of labor to be {{employed}} and reproduced in large measure predetermines the volume and dynamics of all social production. In connection with this, the <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> indices â reflecting the expenditures of the means of labor on the reproduction of a unit of the social product â are increasingly confirmed not only as accounting-analytical indices but also as obligatory indices for assessing the effectiveness of the performance of enterprises under the new conditions of management. The paramount role of <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> and output-capital ratio indices under the new conditions of planning and economic incentives is organically related to the ever-increasing significance of the means of labor in the development of socialist production. V. I. Lenin emphasized that "without machinesâ¦ socialism is an empty phrase. " (1) The restructuring of the work of enterprises and branches of social production in socialist countries engaged in economic reform and the assessment of their work by society are taking place with due regard to the maximum utilization of scientific and technical progress materialized in the means of labor. This is expressed in changes in the calculation of certain indices. Thus while profitability was previously calculated as the relationship between profit and enterprise cost of production, profitability today is calculated as the relationship of profit to fixed productive capital and normative working capital; moreover, the means of labor make up more than 90 % of the aggregate value of productive capital. Accordingly, the rise in the role of <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> and output-capital ratio indices on the whole is predetermined {{by the fact that they}} characterize the relationship between the decisive productive effect and the main factor in the growth and improvement of social production. ...|$|R
