500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
5000|$|... "To see my name {{listed in}} the credits on each song was really {{important}} to me because I’m a songwriter. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> working with such talented writers. They all brought {{so much to the}} table and really helped me flesh out my sound. I grew up listening to Simon & Garfunkel, The Mamas & the Papas, Cat Stevens, and Kris Kristofferson. I love hard-edged vocals over pretty melodies — that’s what I’m about.″ ...|$|R
5000|$|Michael Adams of 411mania {{gave the}} episode 7/10. [...] "I liked Mitchell this week. ... The Cam/Mitchell story was minimal, however, {{it was very}} funny and {{touching}} and Mitch {{had a lot of}} great lines. ... <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> Mitchell's response when he thought Cam was yelling at him for calling the guy homeless. Good stuff. I think Jesse Tyler Ferguson will get an Emmy nomination this year, however, I don't think they've given him enough good material for the win. Shame." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{brought up}} to follow his father's career path, Jagger [...] "was always a singer" [...] as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. [...] "I always sang as a child. I {{was one of those}} kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> {{listening}} to singers on the radio–the BBC or Radio Luxembourg–or watching them on TV and in the movies." ...|$|R
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review, [...] "I’ve said this over and over, but {{one of my favorite}} things this season are the Camelot outfits. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> how Regina is dressed routinely in red while Emma is dressed in white: similar to how their wardrobe choices reflected their intentions back in the first season." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kimron Corion {{wrote for}} The Huffington Post, [...] "I {{have never met}} Mr. Trump, but I enjoy reading his enlightening books. My {{favorite}} is The Art of the Deal, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> The Midas Touch which was also co-authored by Robert Kiyosaki." [...] The book inspired Australian entrepreneurs to create a real estate company and name their venture after {{the title of the}} work. Casey Bond wrote for GOBankingRates, [...] "Theoretically, you could just read the list {{at the end of every}} chapter and get the gist of the book, but I find the value of Midas Touch to be in the storytelling of real-life experiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle it with a little sense of humour. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> a girl who appreciates darkness. I'm a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour." ...|$|E

My cousins were the Alice Cooper fans; I was the David Bowie, Lou Reed fan. But they had made me watch 'Teenage Lament '74' on Top of the Pops." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{always thought}} I'd {{like to go}} back to music. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> {{exploring}} a subject from scratch to interview a nuclear physicist. The live job was a bit like an Open Universitydegree course. The longer I did it, the more I realised how little I know, which is part of ageing.

5000|$|As {{published}} in Miss Earth's official website, Michelle described her childhood days as, [...] "I {{was one of}} the best students in my school, my favorites subjects were science, and Spanish. I loved to play in the park near to my house with my cousins and friends, we used to plant flowers and pick up flowers to decorate our houses, we were like the guardians of the park, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> to dress up like a model and imagine that I was a super model." [...] She learned that, [...] "I learned to love nature with my friends; we were so worried about the plants and animals. And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> to respect every living thing on earth." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jemison began {{dancing at}} the age of 11. [...] "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a {{professional}} dancer," [...] said Jemison. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of [...] "Maria" [...] in West Side Story. She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> the arts," [...] says Jemison. [...] "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream." [...] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, [...] "You can always dance if you're a doctor, but you can't doctor if you're a dancer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor, poor Kablunets," [...] murmured Chingatok, {{descending}} {{from his}} position, and wandering away towards {{the outskirts of}} the village. [...] "You are very clever, but you are somewhat foolish. I pity you, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> you well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> her." [...] And {{then the}} old man made his confession. [...] "I loved her well;--better than I had ever thought to love any one again, but you and Perry. I loved her very dearly, and felt that I should have been proud to have called her my wife.

2500|$|Sacks {{would later}} {{describe}} his {{experience on the}} kibbutz as an [...] "anodyne to the lonely, torturing months in Sinclair's lab". He said he lost [...] from his previously overweight body, {{as a result of}} the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time traveling around the country, with time scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: [...] "I wondered again, as I had wondered when I first went to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor. I had become very interested in neurophysiology, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> marine biology; [...] [...] [...] But I was 'cured' now; it was time to return to medicine, to start clinical work, seeing patients in London." ...|$|R

But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> very much this of the Duchess de Berri. She gave me the pattern herself. And, after, all, this cornette à petite santé of Lady Blaze is a dear little thing; then, again, this coiffe à dentelle of Lady Macaroni is quite a pet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Arabella," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think that}} you do not {{understand}} me, and that it is not likely that you should. If so, our further talking will be worse than useless. I have taken no account of what will be given between your son and me in your sense of the word giving. But he has professed to--to love me"--as she spoke, she still looked on the lady's face, but her eyelashes for a moment screened her eyes, and her colour was a little heightened--"and I have acknowledged that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> him, and so we are engaged. To me my promise is sacred. I will not be threatened into breaking it. If, however, he shall wish to change his mind, he can do so. I will not upbraid him; will not, if I can help it, think harshly of him. So much you may tell him if it suits you; but I will not listen to your calculations as to how much or how little each of us may have to give to the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why should}} I not leave you, even supposing {{it to be}} true that you do love me? To my cost I love you, and am I any longer to endure the daily humiliation of seeing myself, the poor German companion, who has nothing but her beauty, put aside in favour of another whom <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love.</b> You say you love me, and bid me stay; now, tell me what is your purpose towards me? Do you intend to try to take {{advantage}} of my infatuation to make me your mistress? It is, I am told, a common thing for such proposals to be made to women in my position, whom it would be folly for wealthy gentlemen to marry. If so, abandon that idea; for I tell you, Philip, that I would rather die than so disgrace my ancient name to gratify myself. I know you money-loving English do not think very much of race unless the bearers of the name are rich; but we do; and, although you would think it a mesalliance to marry me, I, on the other hand, should not be proud of an alliance with you. Why, Philip, my ancestors were princes of royal blood when yours still herded the swine in these woods. I can show more than thirty quarterings upon my shield, each the mark of a noble house, and I will not be the first to put a bar sinister across them. Now, I have spoken plainly, indelicately perhaps, and there is only one more word to be said between us, and that word is good-bye," [...] and she held out her hand.|$|E
5000|$|Of his influences, he said: [...] "I {{have three}} {{different}} places that I draw inspiration from. There's the guitar guys like Jason Mraz, John Mayer and Jack Johnson; piano influences like Coldplay, The Fray and OneRepublic. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> really <b>love</b> how hip-hop creates complexity in words. I love Common, Lauryn Hill, Jay-Z and Kanye West." ...|$|R
5000|$|Curtin was {{recruited}} to play Mary by friend Bonnie Turner after another actress was deemed too sweet for the part. Co-star John Lithgow said, [...] "We really needed {{a very strong}} human comic presence[...] [...] [...] Someone who could give it out and dish it out." [...] Curtin had earlier worked with Bonnie and Terry Turner on Saturday Night Live and in the 1993 film Coneheads. [...] She originally signed for just seven episodes, but soon agreed to extend her commitment. [...] "I loved the character, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> the sense of humor on the show," [...] she later explained. [...] "I had known John in New York, and I'm very comfortable with him. It made me laugh when John and I were working together -- there just would be puddles on the floor." ...|$|R

6000|$|This {{is almost}} the only passage in the poem in which {{something}} of the vastness of visible nature is conveyed. He saw the vastness only in the sky on nights with a full moon or when he made a telescope of his hat to watch the flight of the lark. It was not a hilly country about his native place, and his horizon was a very limited one, usually bounded by the hedgerow timber {{at the end of}} the level field. The things he depicts were seen at short range, and the poetry, we see, was of a very modest kind. It was a [...] "humble note" [...] which pleased me in the days of long ago when I was young and very ignorant, and as it pleases me still it may be supposed that mentally I have not progressed with the years. Nevertheless, I am not incapable of appreciating the greater music; all that is said in its praise, even to the extremest expressions of admiration of those who are moved to a sense of wonder by it, find an echo in me. But it is not only a delight to me to listen to the lark singing at heaven's gate and to the vesper nightingale in the oak copse--the singer of a golden throat and wondrous artistry; <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> the smaller vocalists--the modest shufewing and the lesser whitethroat and the yellowhammer with his simple chant. These are very dear to me: their strains do not strike me as trivial; they have a lesser distinction of their own and I would not miss them from the choir. The literary man will smile at this and say that my paper is naught but an idle exercise, but I fancy I shall sleep the better tonight for having discharged this ancient debt which has been long on my conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let me repeat," [...] Herr Freudenberg declared, [...] "that before {{many years}} are passed--perhaps, indeed, before many months--it is the {{intention}} of my country either to inflict a scathing diplomatic humiliation upon Great Britain, or to engage in this war the fear of which has kept her {{in a state of}} panic for the last ten years. Keep that in your minds, my friends. Friendship is a great thing, honor is a great thing, generosity is a great thing, but I would speak to you three citizens of France to-day as I would speak to her rulers had I access to them, and I would say, 'Do you dare, for the sake of an alliance out of which you have procured no single benefit, do you dare to drag your country into unnecessary, fruitless and bloody war?' You have nothing to gain by it, you have everything to lose. Let Germany deal with her traditional enemy in her own way. And as for France, let France believe what is, without doubt, the truth--that she has nothing whatever to fear from Germany. I will not speak of the past, but the greatest thinkers in Germany to-day regret nothing so much in the history of her splendid rise as that unfortunate campaign of Bismarck's. It is the one blot upon her magnificent history. Let that go--let that go and be buried. I bring you timely warning. I come to the city I love, for her own sake, for the sake of her people whom <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love.</b> I beg you to listen to these words of mine, to adjust your policy so that little by little you weaken the joints which bind you to England, so that when the time comes you yourself may not be dragged into a hopeless and pitiless struggle." ...|$|E

6000|$|May I not {{admire the}} daring tulip, because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>also</b> the modest lily? May I not press a kiss upon the sweet violet, because {{the scent of}} the queenly rose is {{precious}} to me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] she {{answered}} carelessly. [...] "After all, thou art my cousin; <b>also,</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> nursing--it is a woman's trade. Like enough I had done {{as much for}} any slave. Now, too, that the danger is past, I leave thee." ...|$|R
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Advocate, Carpenter was identified as bisexual. [...] "While my first love was a boy and I've had numerous male lovers, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> women," [...] Carpenter said.

5000|$|I love old-school baseball, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>love</b> the {{way people}} who've spent a {{lifetime}} in the game talk about the game.

5000|$|Lee and I {{first met}} in a South London {{rehearsal}} room, where five frantic grinning actors were hurriedly trying to learn their parts in comedy sketches which Lee and I had been commissioned to write independently. The show was called [...] "Words, Words, Words" [...] (or as it became affectionately known, [...] "Worst, Worst, Worst"), the brainchild of Marjorie Sigley, Head of Children's Programmes at Thames TV. She was trying to disguise education-based material as pure light entertainment, which seemed quite an interesting challenge. Other writers were involved too, but somehow Lee and I became the main contributors and so we began {{seeing a lot of}} each other's work at the following readthroughs. I thought Lee's stuff was annoyingly good, and he thought my stuff was irritatingly splendid, so when Lee was later given the go-ahead to develop a comedy-drama which shared similar aspirations to the one-off [...] "Words" [...] series, he rang and asked if I would like to collaborate. Up until this time I had trained and worked mostly as an actor (Glasgow Citizens Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Royal Shakespeare Company) but because <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> writing (and had a tax bill to pay) I immediately said [...] "certainly".|$|R
6000|$|There {{were other}} open spaces {{covered with a}} {{vegetation}} almost as interesting as the canes and the trees: this was where what were called [...] "weeds" [...] were allowed to flourish. Here were the thorn-apple, chenopodium, sow-thistle, wild mustard, redweed, viper's bugloss, and others, both native and introduced, in dense thickets five or six feet high. It was difficult to push one's way through these thickets, and one was always in dread of treading on a snake. At another spot fennel flourished by itself, {{as if it had}} some mysterious power, perhaps its peculiar smell, of keeping other plants at a proper distance. It formed quite a thicket, and grew to a height of ten or twelve feet. This spot was a favourite haunt of mine, as it was in a waste place at the furthest point from the house, a wild solitary spot where I could spend long hours by myself watching the birds. But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> the fennel for itself, its beautiful green feathery foliage and the smell of it, also the taste, so that whenever I visited that secluded spot I would rub the crushed leaves in my palms and chew the small twigs for their peculiar fennel flavour.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} you know, my friend, how wise you are," [...] he said. [...] "We {{all of us at}} your age love an image of our own carving. Ah, if only we could be content to worship the white, changeless statute! But we are fools. We pray the gods to give her life, and under our hot kisses she becomes a woman. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>loved</b> when <b>I</b> was your age, Paul. Your countrymen, they are so practical, they know only one kind of love. It is business-like, rich--how puts it your poet? 'rich in saving common sense.' But there are many kinds, you {{understand}} that, my friend. You are wise, do not confuse them. She was a child of the mountains. I used to walk three leagues to Mass each day to worship her. Had I been wise--had I so left it, the memory of her would have coloured all my life with glory. But I was a fool, my friend; I turned her into a woman. Ah!"--he made a gesture of disgust--"such a fat, ugly woman, Paul, I turned her into. I had much difficulty in getting rid of her. We should never touch things in life that are beautiful; we have such clumsy hands, we spoil whatever we touch." ...|$|R
