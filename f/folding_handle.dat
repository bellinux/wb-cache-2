50|$|The U.S. Army's flat ovoid M-1932 wartime-issue mess kit {{was made}} of {{galvanized}} steel (stainless steel in the later M-1942), and was a divided pan-and-body system. When opened, the mess kit consisted of two halves: the deeper half forms a shallow, flat-bottom, ovoid Meat Can Body, designed to receive the Meat Ration, the meat portion of the prewar canned Reserve Ration. The Meat Can Body, with its <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> extended, can double as a crude skillet. The Mess Kit Plate (lid) is even more shallow, and is pressed to form two compartments, with a center divide wide enough to accommodate the <b>folding</b> <b>handle.</b> The plate also has a very secure ring that is {{held in place by}} friction.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} description, the ST-series bikes have a bench-style saddle, small fat tires, and <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> bars. They have an {{air-cooled}} 4-stroke engine {{with either a}} semi-automatic 3-speed transmission or a 4-speed manual gearbox. The ST90 uses larger 3.00-14 tires, compared to the 3.50-10 and 4.00-10 of the smaller bikes. For more detail about individual models, see the accompanying Infoboxes and the External Links section below.|$|E

50|$|The Flakvierling weapon {{consisted}} of quad-mounted 2 cm Flak 38 AA guns with collapsing seats, <b>folding</b> <b>handles,</b> and ammunition racks. The mount had a triangular base with a jack at each leg for levelling the gun. The tracker traversed and elevated the mount manually using two handwheels. When raised, the weapon measured 307 cm (10 feet 1 inch) high.|$|R
50|$|A new {{pattern of}} mess tin was {{developed}} for the Web Equipment 1937 Pattern, which was a nested, two-piece rectangular mess tin with long, <b>folding</b> <b>handles.</b> An enamelled tin mug was used for drinking hot liquids. The water bottle of the 1908 Pattern Web Equipment was unchanged, though the web carrier was changed to incorporate the 1-inch-wide brace ends of the 1937 gear.|$|R
50|$|The SL-250 has a 250 watt DC motor {{that can}} propel {{it up to}} 14 mph. It stands 40 inches tall, 40 inches long, and 12 inches wide. It holds two 24/7ah (UL, CE) {{batteries}} in series. The batteries last 10-15.5 miles on a 5-hour charge. It rides on Rubber Pneumatic tires (8"). It features a head light, turn signals, horn, key switch, volt meter, variable speed throttle, <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> bars. It costs around $550.00-$650.00.|$|E
5000|$|The CMG-2's barrel was {{detachable}} {{and had a}} <b>folding</b> <b>handle,</b> so an overheated barrel {{could be}} replaced in the field. The barrel had a 1:9 twist and was meant to fire an experimental [...] bullet, designed for longer ranges than the then-standard [...] M193 bullet. Unlike the M60 machine gun then in use in the Vietnam War, which had its bipod and gas cylinder as integral to the spare barrel, an M2 bipod was mounted over the gas plug set in the CMG-2's ventilated handguard and was locked into place by the spare barrel's gas block.|$|E
50|$|When stored, the Mess Kit Plate {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} ovoid Meat Can Body, while the stamped <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> is folded over the inverse side of the plate's center divider, and latched onto the edge of the Body. It is further secured folding the lid's ring {{toward the center of the}} mess kit, which locks onto another latch. In use, each piece may be used individually, or as a unitary three-compartment mess tray, {{accomplished}} by sliding the lid-plate's center divider onto the <b>folding</b> <b>handle,</b> and securing it to the handle by the ring-and-latch mechanisms. When latched, the kit can be held in a ready position by the user in one hand to receive U.S. Army's 'A' or 'B' field kitchen rations. As the soldier passed along the mess line, food service personnel would dole out hot items first, often meat followed by vegetables, potatoes and other side dishes, ostensibly separated by the tray dividers. Dessert was piled in the center of the accumulated portions — if the soldier was lucky. While a soldier could use the handled Meat Can Body from his kit to cook raw food, it is really too shallow and thin to serve as an effective skillet, and was usually restricted to heating the canned Meat Ration. After 1938, the Meat Can Body was used to heat the meat and vegetable component of the C-ration, or to reconstitute breakfast items such as C-ration powdered eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{shelf of}} a true barrister's {{bookcase}} must be portable with a heavy load of books. The more robust examples have <b>folding</b> <b>handles</b> {{at the ends of}} each shelf. Modern [...] "decorator" [...] copies of these may look the same, but are often too lightly constructed to be carried whilst loaded, or may even be simply a single fixed case as per a normal bookcase, but with separate doors to each shelf to give the appearance of a barrister's bookcase.|$|R
5000|$|A binder clip, or a banker's clip or {{foldover}} clip or a cow clip, is {{a simple}} device for binding sheets of paper together. It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily, unlike the staple. The term [...] "foldback clip" [...] {{is used in the}} United Kingdom to describe this invention (not to be confused with a Bulldog clip, an older device with the same function, which is stronger and has rigid rather than <b>folding</b> <b>handles).</b> It is also sometimes referred to as a [...] "handbag clip" [...] because, when not in use, its clip can be up to look like a handbag.|$|R

Joint combines zero backlash, positive locking, and centerline pivoting. Used in <b>folding</b> tool <b>handles,</b> portable antenna booms, {{and many other}} deployable structures...|$|R
50|$|Some large combo amps {{and large}} speaker {{cabinets}} have ball-bearing-mounted caster wheels {{to make it}} easier to move them. All combo amplifiers and speaker cabinets have some types of carry handles, either a <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> on the top or recessed handles on the sides. There are two types of recessed handles: some equipment has folding, spring-loaded metal handles, with the spring holding the handle flush against the chassis until it is pulled out for use; the second type is handles that are non-moving, and which are flush with the surface of the amp/cab, but with a hollow area behind the handle for the hand to go. In both cases, the handle does not project out beyond the amp/cab, preventing the handle from catching on items during transportation and/or being damaged.|$|E
50|$|The Mark II was {{the most}} common variant, with two million units produced. It was a much rougher weapon than the Mk I. The flash {{eliminator}} and the <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> (the grip) of the Mk I were eliminated. A removable barrel was now provided which projected 3 in beyond the barrel sleeve. Also, a special catch allowed the magazine to be slid partly out of the magazine housing and the housing rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (from the operator's perspective), together covering the ejection opening and allowing the weapon and magazine both to lie flat on its side. The barrel sleeve was shorter and rather than having small holes on the top, it had three sets of three holes equally spaced on the shroud. To allow a soldier to hold a Sten by the hot barrel sleeve with the supporting hand, an insulating lace-on leather sleeve guard was sometimes issued. Sten Mk II's in German possession were designated MP 749(e). Some MkIIs were fitted with a wooden stock as this part was desirable and interchangeable with the Mk V. Also, the Spz-kr assault rifle uses the receiver and components from the Sten Mk II.|$|E
50|$|The Strida {{is made by}} Ming Cycle in Taiwan. There was a key patent which {{covered the}} early Strida 1 onwards. The U.S. version of this patent was filed in 1986 and expired in 2006, which means only the {{mechanism}} used in Strida 1 and 2 of the product {{is now in the}} public domain. Several other aspects of the latest Strida 3 to 5.x versions are currently covered by patents in various countries, including the <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> bar system US7243573, hub and locking system US7367632, front joint system US7681900, with other patents pending. The Patents, Trademark, Copyright and other IP are owned by Ming Cycle, Taiwan. Some components of the Series 3 to Series 5 machines are interchangeable but other significant components and sub-assemblies are not. Series 5 and Series 4 (Mini) machines have a freewheel mounted in the conventional position on the rear wheel (In Series 3 the freewheel, a commonly available Shimano 18t model, is part of the metal and plastic bottom bracket/crankset assembly) and a metal bottom bracket shell which incorporates an eccentric housing to adjust belt tension. Alternative folding handlebars which give more knee clearance for the taller rider are available for the Series 5; these may be retro-fitted in place of the standard folding handlebars on Series 3 and Series 4 (Mini).|$|E

40|$|How can {{a vacuum}} cleaner motivate you to use it? From a {{sustainability}} perspective, the author asked {{the question of how}} such a solution would look like? These where issues that the project tackled and devised solutions for. The project wanted to explore the physical modeling and {{a large part of the}} final result consisted of a full scale model. The project found that the problem of vacuuming largely consisted of the problem of storage the product. The project found that the motivation for the job, therefore, could be resolved by a better designed vacuum cleaner with a built-in hose, <b>folding</b> <b>handles,</b> which could be stored integrated within the vacuum cleaner. The project also found that a rechargeable energy-efficient battery could serve as a factor to motivate an everyday job when the user do not have to fuss with the cord...|$|R
5000|$|A declassified US {{analysis}} of the feed system, based on models captured during the Korean War, reads: An interesting departure was made from the heretofore orthodox practice of feeding ammunition to a gun of this caliber. The feed, somewhat resembling a grooved revolver cylinder, {{is an integral part}} of the gun, and the cartridges remain axial throughout the entire operation.The cylindrical feed cage is rotated by an arm that engages a slot in the gas piston. A helical groove in the drum arrangement withdraws the cartridges from the metal disintegrating link belt as it moves through the feedway by engaging their rims and gradually camming the cartridges rearward. The freed cartridges are then presented at the bottom of the receiver for chambering by final rotation.This circular type of feed holds ten rounds. Several phases are required to completely delink a round and roll it up into position for being shoved into the chamber. A small <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> held on the top side is used to rotate the feed drum when filling with cartridges.Camming the round slowly out of the belt with this type of feeder causes practically no drag when the weapon is fired at high speed. It has belt pull enough to take care of practically any length belt desired. ...The Russian Air Force nicknamed this circular arrangement the [...] "bird-cage" [...] feed. It is an adaptation of a system first used by the Polish designer, Gabriel Szakats. (Ian V. Hogg called the ShKAS feeding system a [...] "squirrel cage".) ...|$|E
5000|$|The 1874-model {{was made}} of tinplated steel and had a [...] "D" [...] plan view with rounded corners. The tray or cup piece had a <b>folding</b> <b>handle</b> that opened to the side. The tray also functioned as a deep lid for the pan. This change from the 1854-model allowed {{the use of the}} narrow and tighter curved side of the cup rim for drinking. It also {{permitted}} the tray to briefly be held over a fire. The corners of the square shaped bail were also more rounded. The geometry of the older British mess tins was substantially different. The 1854-model was [...] "D" [...] shaped in plan view and {{was made of}} tinplated iron. It was fabricated from front and back panels of sheet metal. The tray or cup nested inside the pan. The handle of the tray or cup folded inside but was on the flat [...] "back side" [...] forcing the user to drink from the broadly curved front. The lid was intermediate in depth, {{could be used as a}} plate, and set down securely on the pan. The bail was square shaped and the corners were tight curves. The 1810 (181314)-model is semicircular or [...] "C" [...] shaped in plan view and is made of tinplated iron. The tray of the 1810-model had no handle but nested inside the pan or lower section. The lid covered the pan and had a pull ring for easy removal, but apparently had no other intended use. The bail was curved.|$|E
5000|$|Folding-stock, shorter 436 mm barrel, paratrooper version, <b>folding</b> {{charging}} <b>handle.</b> This shorter {{version was}} requested by Belgian paratroopers. The upper receiver was not cut for a carry handle, the bolt stop device were absent which allowed the folded-stock rifle to fit {{through the doorway}} of their C-119 Flying Boxcar when worn horizontally across the chest.|$|R
50|$|Originally Cegléd jugs {{were made}} of {{galvanized}} tin. Later they {{were made of}} aluminium and steel, both bare metal and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) was made of a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, the mouth and bottom rims were doubly <b>folded.</b> The <b>handle</b> was attached by rivets.|$|R

50|$|A {{civilian}} mess kit, {{which may}} serve {{from one person}} to a family of eight, is a collection of common kitchen wares designed to be lightweight and easy to store. Such kits are typically constructed from aluminium, though enameled steel is also common, and some items (such as cutlery or plates) may be made of more expensive materials, such as titanium, to further save weight, or of plastic. A civilian mess kit usually contains at least a skillet, a kettle (which may also serve as a coffee pot), a plate, a cup (typically a Sierra cup), and cutlery. Utensils usually consist of forks, knives, and spoons, as at home, but may be replaced by specialty items like sporks or folding chopsticks. Kits usually come with either <b>folding</b> <b>handles</b> or a detachable handle which can be used with other cookware. Items are stored compactly by nesting them in other components (like a Russian doll); the whole kit may be placed in a stuff sack.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} US military's M249 Product Improvement Program (PIP), the M249 was updated with: a new {{synthetic}} stock and modified buffer assembly, a single-position gas regulator, a so-called birdcage type flash hider/compensator from the M16A2, a polymer barrel heat guard, and a <b>folding</b> carry <b>handle.</b> As a result, the weapon’s weight increased to 7.47 kg. Many of the PIP upgrades were later incorporated by FN for the Minimi.|$|R
50|$|One unusual {{feature is}} the ability to store a spare 44-round {{magazine}} {{at the rear of the}} gun, where it also functions as a stock. A wire folding stock is also available. Another unusual feature is that this firearm's charging handle is located directly behind the front sight and folds out of the way when not in use. A similar <b>folding</b> charging <b>handle</b> can be seen on the Heckler & Koch G36.|$|R
50|$|The initial ACR {{design was}} {{offered in the}} Army's Individual Carbine competition. In late 2011, Remington {{unveiled}} an improved version specifically for the competition. Improvements included a magnesium lower receiver, A2-style pistol grip, collapsible but non-foldable stock, carbine length gas system, a new barrel nut (which eliminates the quick change barrel), and a <b>folding</b> charging <b>handle.</b> These changes made the weapon 1.8 lbs lighter. The Individual Carbine competition was cancelled before a winning weapon was chosen.|$|R

50|$|The {{inherent}} {{accuracy of}} the rifle {{is due to the}} action being bolted with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy material to an aluminium receiver, to which all major rifle components are in turn attached. As it keeps the action from moving away from zero (determined by the alignment of the scope to the rifle bore rather than the alignment of the action to the stock) the {{accuracy of the}} rifle is very high. Adding a <b>folding</b> stock <b>handle,</b> this sniper rifle can be used for both HALO insertions and walking deployments of sniper forces.|$|R
