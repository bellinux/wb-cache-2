Though not found on small chucks it is common for larger chucks (the one in the second photo was made around 1900 and is 24" [...] in diameter) to have many of the {{features}} of a faceplate. The jaws are stepped on one side and full height for gripping on the other and are reversible. Generally the jaws are usable for holding either outside as shown here, or inside as in gripping the inside of a pipe.|$|E
50|$|Heavy-duty tire changers require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} changers deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. Heavy-duty tire changers {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. Heavy-duty tire changers are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the heavy-duty tire changers are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated self-centering four <b>jaw</b> <b>chuck</b> with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the center bore.|$|E

50|$|The {{faceplate}} may {{be attached}} to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement or threaded studs and a circular recess fitting a flange {{on the end of the}} spindle. Increasingly common is the camlock arrangement where shaped studs and cams replace threaded studs for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four <b>jaw</b> <b>chucks.</b>|$|R

40|$|Multifingered {{computer}} controlled robot hands {{have been built}} by researchers to recreate human functionality. Our research {{is focused on the}} use of the Belgrade/USC robot hand as a prototype prosthesis for below-elbow amputees. A method has been developed that combines EMG and computer signals to control the phases of prehension. Simulation work presented here, based on pilot data, uses surface EMG from the forearm to provide signals for the control of the hand. 1. Introduction The human hand is capable of forming a variety of shapes [Schlesinger 1919, Napier 1956, Iberall et al 1986]. For example, Schlesinger [1919] identified various postures for a prosthetic hand, such as the open fisted cylindrical grasp, close fisted cylindrical grasp, three <b>jaw</b> <b>chuck,</b> two point palmar prehension, and lateral prehension. MacKenzie and Iberall (1994) have summarized research from a variety of fields, identifying about 20 unique postures suitable for grasping objects. In contrast, prosthetic hands [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A three <b>jaw</b> <b>chuck</b> {{set from}} a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the machine tool operator. Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal processing undertaken as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of lathe chuck jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to scrap worn jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine tool guarding was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the machine tool operator. ...|$|E
40|$|The chuck has, {{for a long}} time, been {{considered}} the weakest link of a lathe. This is mainly due to its two-fold connection, to the machine spindle {{on the one hand}} and to the workpiece on the other. An additional limitation of the chuck lies in the incomplete knowledge one has of the load it is exposed to during operation, which usually leads to a less than optimal machining process. Unless our understanding of the properties of clamping devices and of the effects of external loads is improved, the risk is great that this deficiency in our knowledge will be a limiting factor in the continuing development of machine tools [1]. The aim of this work has been to isolate and to investigate the factors that influence the necessary clamping forces when using <b>jaw</b> <b>chucks.</b> An extensive model development has been carried out towards a better understanding of the problem. The models thus developed have been analyzed as to their validity using the FEM and also through experimental studies. The present study has been limited to the processing of ring shaped, weak workpieces...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{precision}} ring shaped parts using the turning process depends significantly on the workholding characteristics. Workholding parameters such {{as the number of}} <b>jaws</b> and <b>chucking</b> force are known to influence the roundness tolerance of ring shaped parts commonly used in bearing applications. Experimental trial and error methods are often used in practice to optimize the workholding parameters to achieve the desired part quality. This thesis develops a systematic mathematical approach for optimizing these parameters using a finished cut roundness prediction model and a model for determining the reaction force between the <b>chuck</b> <b>jaws</b> and the ring. The roundness prediction model is verified through experiments for different cutting conditions. The optimization approach takes as input the required roundness tolerance, geometry and mechanical properties of the ring, cutting forces, and the coefficient of friction between the jaws and the ring. The output consists of the minimum number of jaws and the range of acceptable chucking forces that satisfy the required tolerance while preventing slip of the ring. Simulation examples are used to illustrate the proposed workholding optimization approach for a hard turning application. In addition, based on the optimization model, the thesis proposes a novel concept of dynamic chucking force control that promises to yield part roundness that is superior to conventional chucking. M.

50|$|Self-centering <b>chucks</b> {{with four}} <b>jaws</b> {{also can be}} obtained. Although these are often said to suffer from two disadvantages: {{inability}} to hold hex stock, and poor gripping on stock which is oval, only the latter is true. Even with three <b>jaw</b> self centering <b>chucks,</b> work which is not of uniform section along the work (and which is not free of spiral or 'wind') should not be gripped, as the jaws can be strained and the accuracy permanently impaired.|$|R
40|$|The chuck has for a {{long time}} been {{considered}} the weakest link of a lathe. This is mainly due to its twofold connection, to the machine spindle {{on the one hand and}} to the work-piece on the other. An additional limitation of the chuck lies in the incomplete knowledge one has of the load it is exposed to during operation, which usually leads to a less than optimal machining process. Unless our understanding of the properties of clamping devices and of the effects of external loads is improved, the risk is great that this deficiency in our knowledge will be a limiting factor in the continuing development of machine tools. The aim of this thesis has been to isolate and to investigate the factors that influence the machining result when using <b>jaw</b> <b>chucks</b> for clamping. An extensive model development has been carried out towards a better understanding of the problem. The models thus developed have been analyzed as to their validity using the FEM and also through extensive experimental studies. The present study has been limited to the processing of ring-shaped, weak work-pieces. This limitation has been introduced because tolerance problems are significant when working on ring-shaped work-pieces and also because rings are well suited to study the influence of other factors. Among these factors, the influence of cutting forces on required clamping-forces and effect of mass forces on the jaws can be mentioned. The results presented here are intended to form the basis for future adaptive control of the machining process with respect to clamping security. Subsequent research should focus on an extension of the models presented, a thorough investigation of the conditions of friction and contact-stiffness between jaws and work piece, the development of measuring methods for registration of chuck-stifnesses, the analysis of other work-piece geometries, and finally also study alternative principles for clamping. Hereby a deeper understanding can be gained in the areas discussed in the present thesis in order to improve our knowledge of the influence clamping devices have on productivity...|$|R
50|$|On an , each jaw can {{be moved}} independently. Because they most often have four jaws, the term four-jaw chuck without other {{qualification}} is understood by machinists to mean a chuck with four independent jaws. The independence of the <b>jaws</b> makes these <b>chucks</b> ideal for (a) gripping non-circular cross sections and (b) gripping circular cross sections with extreme precision (when the last few hundredths of a millimeter thousandths of an inch of runout must be manually eliminated). The non-self-centering action of the independent jaws makes centering highly controllable (for an experienced user), but {{at the expense of}} speed and ease. Four-jaw chucks are almost never used for tool holding. Four-jaw chucks can be found on lathes and indexing heads.|$|R
40|$|Tool {{wear and}} tool {{breakage}} recognition is based {{as a rule}} on previously "learnt" signal patterns {{when it comes to}} monitoring the machining process of machine tools. This is necessary as the vibrations of the tool may superimpose on the cutting characteristics to an extent that an evaluation without any pattern becomes incertain or even impossible. Morever, interfering factors such as variations in the material charges, blank-shape faults or material defects often cause an unjustified response of the monitoring systems and false interpretations. The paper presents a surveillance system capable of evaluating the signals coming from the strain gauges in the turning <b>chuck</b> <b>jaws</b> not only for monitoring the chucking force but also for detecting the cutting force during the cutting process. The information contained in the chucking force signal can hence be used successfully both for the determination of the cutting force and for tool breakage recognition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the lathe spindle <b>chuck</b> <b>jaws.</b> The position of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.
