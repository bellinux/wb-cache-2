5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It <b>is</b> <b>astonishing</b> that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E

25|$|The {{diversity}} of Brazil's fungi - even {{the small amount}} known so far to scientists - <b>is</b> <b>astonishing.</b> Using only conventional microscopy, and examining living leaves collected from various plants, the mycologist Batista and his colleagues, working in Pernambuco in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, regularly recorded more than one fungial species, and sometimes up to ten on a single leaf. Although information about fungi worldwide remains very fragmented, a preliminary estimate, based only {{on the work of}} Batista, shows that the number of potentially endemic fungal species in Brazil already exceeds 2000. Also, fungi is very often spot in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lancashire League {{is a testament to}} local cricketers and their supporters, but the sheer quantity and quality of the professional cricketers that have been drawn to the milltowns of East Lancashire and the surrounding area <b>is</b> <b>astonishing.</b> Players {{from all over the world}} have come to live and play in the League including: Dik Abed, Bill Alley, Nyron Asgarali, Nathan Astle, Sydney Barnes, Allan Border, Chris Cairns, Sir Learie Constantine, Kapil Dev, Allan Donald, Bruce Dooland, Roy Gilchrist, Denis Lillee, Trevor Chappell, Jason Gillespie, Kerry O'Keeffe, Charlie Griffith, Andrew Hall, Wes Hall, Roger Harper, Chris Harris, George Headley, Michael Holding, Murali Kartik, Charlie Llewellyn, Clive Lloyd, Manny Martindale, Cec Pepper, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts, Fred Root, Jacques Rudolph, Peter Sleep, 'Big' Jim Smith, Hugh Tayfield, George Tribe, Lou Vincent, Shane Warne, Chester Watson, Steve Waugh, Bilawal Bhatti, Alviro Petersen, Robin Petersen and Everton Weekes. Its is a rule of the competition that each team must have a professional player in their squad. Should the professional be unavailable then a substitute must be found. Teams not playing a pro can be fined.|$|E
500|$|The {{proposed}} revival {{was mentioned}} in several more letters throughout {{the autumn of}} 1875, until on 23 November Gilbert wrote, [...] "I have heard no more about Thespis. It <b>is</b> <b>astonishing</b> how quickly these capitalists dry up under the magic influence of the words 'cash down'." [...] In 1895, with Richard D'Oyly Carte struggling to rediscover success at the Savoy, he once again proposed a revival of Thespis, but the idea was not pursued. No mention of the whereabouts of the music of Thespis exists since 1897, and scholars have searched for it among many of the extant collections. Except for two songs and some ballet music, it is presumed lost.|$|E

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros <b>is</b> <b>astonishing.</b> There is no talk of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. You can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale." [...] Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the gleam of copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite their humble resources, in July 1841 Guerin and {{the sisters}} opened St. Mary's Academy for Young Ladies, which later became Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College.

[...] Critic Richard Delap writes [...] "There is an abundance of exploitable elements in Bishop's story, so it <b>is</b> <b>astonishing</b> to see how the author keeps them under strict rein, always with a highly keyed visual sense but also with a literary flair that says more by implication than by direct description.

Critics wrote [...] "Juhi Chawla <b>is</b> <b>astonishing</b> and enchanting as Seema.

2500|$|His best Test bowling {{figures of}} 7/34, bowling {{outswing}} {{on a flat}} pitch, enabled England to bowl out the West Indies for 139 in the first innings of the fifth Test at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1953–54, on a pitch on which the groundsman expected the home side to score 700. This enabled England to win the match and to share the series 2–2. [...] He was vice-captain on that tour, and may be considered unlucky never to have been appointed captain of England. According to Alan Gibson: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>astonishing</b> that so good a cricketer, so thoughtful a judge, and so friendly a man, should have been passed over."
