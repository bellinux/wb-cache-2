25|$|In 1817, the Allaire Iron Works {{supplied}} the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> for Savannah, the first steamship {{to make a}} transatlantic crossing. The cylinder, {{one of the largest}} then built, had a diameter of 40inches, while the piston had a stroke of 5 feet. Savannah was not a commercial success, and following her return voyage from Europe, her engine was removed and sold to Allaire.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began {{manufacturing}} new Fw 190 {{models as}} reproductions. By 2012 almost 20 had been produced, most flyable, a few as static display models, with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants, {{which have a}} displacement of 41.2 litres, close to the BMW 801's 41.8 litres, with the same <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> arrangement and number of cylinders.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 2013, BFL168, a Douglas DC-3C (C-GWIR), {{crashed on}} return to Yellowknife Airport, Northwest Territories after {{suffering}} an engine fire. The aircraft {{was on a}} passenger flight from Yellowknife Airport to Hay River Airport. There were 24 people on board the aircraft, of whom three were crew. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was written off. The subsequent investigation determined the cause to be an <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> fatigue crack, propeller feathering pump failure, and overloading of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Savannahs {{engine was}} removed and resold for {{the sum of}} $1,600 to the Allaire Iron Works, which had {{originally}} built the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The cylinder was preserved by the proprietor of the Allaire Works, James P. Allaire, and was later displayed at the New York Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1856. After removal of the engine, the ship {{was used as a}} sailing packet, operating between New York and Savannah, Georgia, until running aground at Long Island on November 5, 1821 and subsequently breaking up.|$|E
25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine is defined as a vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|E

25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E
25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A piston rod, connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the piston on the cylinder side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|E
500|$|Lavochkin {{had been}} {{monitoring}} TsAGIs improvements and began construction in January 1944 of an improved {{version of the}} La-5 that incorporated {{them as well as}} lighter, but stronger, metal wing spars to save weight. The La-5, as well as its predecessors, had been built mostly of wood to conserve strategic materials such as aircraft alloys. With Soviet strategists now confident that supplies of these alloys were unlikely to become a problem, Lavochkin was now able to replace some wooden parts with alloy components. In addition Lavochkin made a number of other changes that differed from c/n 39210206. The engine air intake was moved {{from the bottom of the}} engine cowling to the wing roots, the wing/fuselage fillets were streamlined, each <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> was provided with its own exhaust pipe, the engine cowling covers were reduced in number, a rollbar was added to the cockpit, longer shock struts were fitted for the main landing gear while that for the tail wheel was shortened, an improved PB-1B(V) gunsight was installed, and a new VISh-105V-4 propeller was fitted. Three prototype [...] Berezin B-20 autocannon were mounted in the engine cowling, firing through the propeller, arming the 1944 standard-setter (...) , as the modified aircraft was designated.|$|E
