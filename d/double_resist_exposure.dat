25|$|The {{two issues}} of shot noise and EUV-released {{electrons}} point out two constraining factors: 1) keeping dose {{high enough to}} reduce shot noise to tolerable levels, but also 2) avoiding too high a dose due to the increased contribution of EUV-released photoelectrons and secondary electrons to the <b>resist</b> <b>exposure</b> process, increasing the edge blur and thereby limiting the resolution.

Scanning probe lithography(SPL) {{is capable of}} sub- 30 -nm-patterning {{resolution}} and nanometer-scale alignment registration, suggesting it might provide {{a solution to the}} semiconductor industry’s lithography challenges. However, SPL throughput is significantly lower than conventional lithography techniques. Low throughput most limits the widespread use of SPL for high resolution patterning applications. This article addresses the speed constraints for reliable patterning of organic resists. Electrons field emitted from a sharp probe tip are used to expose the resist. Finite tip-sample capacitance limits the bandwidth of current-controlled lithography in which the tip-sample voltage bias is varied to maintain a fixed emission current during exposure.

A new extraction technique of Dill parameters based on spectroscopic ellipsometry in combination with an advanced <b>resist</b> <b>exposure</b> model is proposed for thick resist analysis. The complex refractive index of the resist is related to the relative concentration of the photoactive compound in the resist in order to describe the vertical distribution of the refractive index and the extinction coefficient. Moreover, Dill parameters are extracted by directly fitting the bleaching curves to the measured ellipsometry data. The new approach was investigated experimentally by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on AZ 5214 E resist with two moderate layer thickness values in order to verify the accuracy of the new method. Dill parameters were extracted by using this new technique and by applying resist samples subjected to different exposure doses. Possible reasons for the variation of Dill parameters depending on resist thickness are explained. Furthermore, advantages, limitations and potential improvements of the model are discussed.

40|$|Abstract. In Micro/Nanowire fabrication, the {{alignment}} and exposure process {{are the most}} critical steps in photolithography process, and indeed for the whole biochip processing. This process determines the success of transferring the Micro/Nanowire design pattern on the mask to the photoresists on the wafer surface. Hence, the resolution requirements and precise alignment are vital; each mask needs to be precisely aligned with original alignment mark in order to transfer the original pattern from mask onto photoresist layer. Otherwise, it can’t successfully transfer the original pattern to the wafer surface causing device and circuit failure. Therefore, the UniMAP’s Second Generation Mask Aligner is used for precise alignment and pattern transfer process. Thus, the paper present a preliminary study on fundamentals of <b>resist</b> <b>exposure</b> and development mechanisms for fabrication of Micro/Nanowire, We demonstrated significance of considering process parameters such as mask aligner, quality of <b>resist,</b> soft bake, <b>exposure</b> time and intensity, and development time.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a resist {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that <b>resist</b> <b>exposure</b> by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} photon absorption. Increasing the dose increases the number of far-reaching electrons, resulting in more extended resist loss. A leading EUV chemically amplified resist exposed to 80 eV electrons at a dose up to 80 uc/cm2 showed up to 7.5 nm resist thickness loss. For an open-source resist exposed near 200 uC/cm2 by 80 eV electrons, the resist thickness lost after post-exposure bake and development was around 13nm, while doubling the dose resulted in increasing the loss to 15nm. On the other hand, for doses >500 uc/cm2, the resist begins to thicken due to crosslinking.|$|R

50|$|Important {{contributions}} to weak-resist polymer chain scission (for positive resists) or crosslinking (for negative resists) come from electron forward scattering and backscattering. The forward scattering process {{is due to}} electron-electron interactions which deflect the primary electrons by a typically small angle, thus statistically broadening the beam in the resist (and further in the substrate). The majority of the electrons do not stop in the resist but penetrate the substrate. These electrons can still contribute to <b>resist</b> <b>exposure</b> by scattering back into the resist and causing subsequent inelastic or exposing processes. This backscattering process originates e.g. from a collision with a heavy particle (i.e. substrate nucleus) and leads to wide-angle scattering of the light electron {{from a range of}} depths (micrometres) in the substrate. The Rutherford backscattering probability increases quickly with substrate nuclear charge.|$|R

Hosts typically accept {{one of their own}} eggs with experimentally added spots and the background colour left visible. In contrast, hosts reject such spotted eggs when individuals had been previously exposed to and rejected one of their own eggs whose background colour had been entirely masked.
