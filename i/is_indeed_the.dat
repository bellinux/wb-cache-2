5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns {{that the only way}} to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself to be faithful to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it <b>is.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> <b>the</b> guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{cyclonic}} and anticyclonic gradient speeds {{approach it}} as the radius of curvature becomes indefinitely large—geostrophic balance <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> limiting case of gradient flow for vanishing centripetal acceleration (that is, for pressure and Coriolis force exactly balancing out).|$|E
25|$|Further, the Buddha {{proves that}} Dhamma <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> best {{thing of all}} things in life. He takes the example of King Pasenadi of the Kosala Kingdom, who has now conquered the Sakyans. The Sakyans revere, praise, and serve him with respect.|$|E
25|$|Gaudiya Vaishnavas and {{followers}} of the Vallabha Sampradaya Nimbarka Sampradaya, use the Gopala Tapani Upanishad, and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> Svayam Bhagavan.

25|$|So far, H {{is only an}} {{abstract}} Hermitian operator. However using the correspondence principle {{it is possible to}} show that, in the classical limit, the expectation value of H <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> classical energy. The correspondence principle does not completely fix the form of the quantum Hamiltonian due to the uncertainty principle and therefore the precise form of the quantum Hamiltonian must be fixed empirically.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, {{no part of the}} inspection requires the test station to verify that this <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> actual mileage. It is merely recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} non-Chabad Jewish figures have {{expressed}} their concurrence {{with the belief}} that Schneerson <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> Messiah.

25|$|Though in his Oct. 17th 1934 Rectorial Address {{delivered}} at St Andrews University he states that:The new Tyranny, disguised in attractive patriotic colours, is enticing youth everywhere into its service.

The fight for human freedom <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> supreme issue of the future, as it has always been.|$|E
25|$|Cuculcán {{himself is}} masculine, but his {{experience}} is feminine. Symbolically the Latin American image establishes a binarism {{in the power}} relations between the Spanish hegemony of masculinity, while associating the indigenous sub-alternity with the feminine. This transference of gender presents itself various times in Leyendas. For example Cuero de Oro (in Ahora me acuerdo) presents the forest as a woman, but he <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> forest. Therefore he becomes {{a woman in a}} passive role. Generally Asturias equates relations of gender to relations of power throughout Leyendas de Guatemala, presenting femininity as a repressed presence.|$|E
25|$|In such a scenario, Jains {{argue that}} the {{material}} cause of a living soul with cetana (conscious entity) is always the soul itself and cause of dead inert matter (non-cetana i.e. without any consciousness) is always the matter itself. If God <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> <b>the</b> creator, then this is an impossible predication as the same cause {{will be responsible for}} two contradictory effects of cetana (life) and acetana (matter). This logically precludes an immaterial God (a conscious entity) from creating this Universe, which is made up of material substances.|$|E
