50|$|Potassium erythorbate (C6H7KO6) is a food additive. Chemically, {{it is the}} {{potassium}} salt of <b>erythorbic</b> acid. As an antioxidant structurally related to vitamin C, it helps improve flavor stability and prevents the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines.|$|E
50|$|Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{banned the}} use of sulfites as a {{preservative}} in foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as salad bar ingredients), {{the use of}} <b>erythorbic</b> acid as a food preservative has increased.|$|E

50|$|Sodium erythorbate (C6H7NaO6) is a food {{additive}} used predominantly in meats, poultry, {{and soft}} drinks. Chemically, {{it is the}} sodium salt of <b>erythorbic</b> acid. When used in processed meat such as hot dogs and beef sticks, it increases {{the rate at which}} nitrite reduces to nitric oxide, thus facilitating a faster cure and retaining the pink coloring. As an antioxidant structurally related to vitamin C, it helps improve flavor stability and prevents the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. When used as a food additive, its E number is E316. The use of <b>erythorbic</b> acid and sodium erythorbate as a food preservative has increased greatly since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites as preservatives in foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as ingredients for fresh salads) and as food processors have responded to the fact that some people are allergic to sulfites. It can also be found in bologna, and is occasionally used in beverages, baked goods, and potato salad.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythorbic</b> acid (iso{{ascorbic acid}}, D-araboascorbic acid, (D-)erythroascorbic acid) is a {{stereoisomer}} of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It is synthesized by a reaction between methyl 2-keto-D-gluconate and sodium methoxide. It {{can also be}} synthesized from sucrose or by strains of Penicillium that have been selected for this feature. It is denoted by E number E315, and is widely used as an antioxidant in processed foods.|$|E
50|$|A {{principal}} {{concern about}} sodium nitrite is {{the formation of}} carcinogenic nitrosamines in meats containing sodium nitrite when meat is charred or overcooked. Such carcinogenic nitrosamines can also be formed from the reaction of nitrite with secondary amines under acidic conditions (such as occurs in the human stomach) as well as during the curing process used to preserve meats. Dietary sources of nitrosamines include US cured meats preserved with sodium nitrite {{as well as the}} dried salted fish eaten in Japan. In the 1920s, a significant change in US meat curing practices resulted in a 69% decrease in average nitrite content. This event preceded the beginning of a dramatic decline in gastric cancer mortality. About 1970, it was found that ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an antioxidant, inhibits nitrosamine formation. Consequently, the addition of at least 550 ppm of ascorbic acid is required in meats manufactured in the United States. Manufacturers sometimes instead use <b>erythorbic</b> acid, a cheaper but equally effective isomer of ascorbic acid. Additionally, manufacturers may include α-tocopherol (vitamin E) to further inhibit nitrosamine production. α-Tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and <b>erythorbic</b> acid all inhibit nitrosamine production by their oxidation-reduction properties. Ascorbic acid, for example, forms dehydroascorbic acid when oxidized, which when in the presence of nitrosonium, a potent nitrosating agent formed from sodium nitrite, reduces the nitrosonium into nitric oxide. The nitrosonium ion formed in acidic nitrite solutions is commonly mislabeled nitrous anhydride, an unstable nitrogen oxide that cannot exist in vitro.|$|E

[...] The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in Canada, the sweetener listed is [...] "glucose-fructose" [...] (another name for high-fructose corn syrup), and (until 2012), it was caffeine-free by default. Brominated vegetable oil, which is found in about 10% of all citrus-flavored soda drinks in the US, is banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Erythorbic</b> acid, a {{stereoisomer}} of {{ascorbic acid}} with similar physicochemical properties, {{is widely used}} as an antioxidant in processed foods. Objectives: The aims {{of the present study}} were to evaluate the effect of <b>erythorbic</b> acid on iron absorption from ferrous sulfate at molar ratios of 2 : 1 and 4 : 1 (relative to iron) and to compare the effect of <b>erythorbic</b> acid directly with that of ascorbic acid at a molar ratio of 4 : 1. Design: Iron absorption from iron-fortified cereal was measured in 10 women on the basis of erythrocyte incorporation of stable iron isotopes (57 Fe or 58 Fe) 14 d after administration. Each woman consumed 4 ferrous-sulfate-fortified test meals (containing 5 mg Fe/meal) with or without added <b>erythorbic</b> or ascorbic acid. The data were evaluated by use of paired t tests, and the results are presented as geometric means. Results: Iron absorption from the test meal without any added enhancer was 4. 1 %. The addition of <b>erythorbic</b> acid (at molar ratios of 2 : 1 and 4 : 1 relative to iron) increased iron absorption 2. 6 -fold (10. 8 %; P 0. 0001) and 4. 6 -fold (18. 8 %; P 0. 0001), respectively. The addition of ascorbic acid (molar ratio of 4 : 1) increased iron absorption 2. 9 -fold (11. 7 %; P 0. 0004). At a molar ratio of 4 : 1, <b>erythorbic</b> acid was 1. 6 -fold (P 0. 0002) as potent an enhancer of iron absorption as was ascorbic acid. Conclusion: Although <b>erythorbic</b> acid is a potent enhancer of iron absorption, its lack of antiscorbutic activity limits its usefulness in iron-fortification programs. However, it may {{play a major role in}} enhancing iron bioavailability from mixed diets that include foods preserved with <b>erythorbic</b> acid. Am J Clin Nutr 2004; 79...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure using a LiChrosorb-NH₂ column and a eluant buffer of 75 : 25 (v/v) of acetonitrile: 0. 05 M KH₂P 0 ₄, pH 5. 95, {{was developed for}} the successful separation and determination of ascorbic and <b>erythorbic</b> acids in selected food samples.

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} exists that smoking significantly lowers {{the concentration of}} plasma antioxidants.

However, the direct cause of ascorbate depletion remains unclear. <b>Erythorbic</b> acid is a stereoisomer of ascorbic acid commonly used as antioxidant in foodstuffs and has the same redox properties as ascorbic acid. We therefore investigated if <b>erythorbic</b> acid {{could be used as a}} non-isotopic marker of smoking-induced oxidative stress. In a sample of smokers (n 10) and non-smokers (n 10), the pharmacokinetics of <b>erythorbic</b> acid were followed after a single oral dose (1 g) and subsequently, the effect of a 2 -week ascorbic acid supplementation (0 · 5 g/d) on <b>erythorbic</b> acid kinetics was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion.

This acid blend is in perfect agreement with the blend recommended by the acidizing expert system. The slight discrepancy is that the expert system followed a conservative approach in adding fluoboric acid, <b>erythorbic</b> acid and EDTA in the pre-flush recommendation. In fact, fluoboric acid assures the disintegration of any clay cementing material, <b>erythorbic</b> acid assures the reduction of iron, while EDTA assures the sequestration of iron released from iron-rich material, siderite and pyrite.

40|$|Polyphenol oxidases are {{important}} enzymes {{because of their}} role in food spoilage, oxidizing monophenols into o-diphenols and/or diphenols into the corresponding o-quinones. The resulting compounds are unstable and can rapidly form brown colored compounds, called melanins. Polyphenol oxidases, (PPOs) have been purified from several sources, particularly from fruits and vegetables. However, successful purification of PPO to homogeneity from plant sources has always been difficult. The purification procedure of PPOs from cassava tuber consisted of (1) the preparation of cassava acetone powder; (2) the buffer extraction of the acetone powder to obtain a crude extract, followed by one of two possible purification procedures. The first consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q and gel filtration on Superdex G 75 to yield two isoenzymes, PPO 1 and PP 02 having molecular weights of 71. 8 +/- 6. 0 and 69. 6 +/- 1. 5 kDa, respectively. The second purification procedure involved hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on phenyl-sepharose CL- 4 B followed by gel filtration on Superdex G 75 to yield a single active PPO fraction of 68. 3 +/- 2. 8 kDa molecular weight. The two isoenzymes obtained by ion exchange chromatography exhibited pH optima of 6. 5 (PPO 1) and 6. 8 (PPO 2) and were stable in the pH range of 7. 5 to 10. 0. These two isoenzymes had a temperature optimum of 30 [...] 40 °C. PPO 2 retained 65 % of its original activity after heating at 50 °C for 10 min whereas PPO 1 was completely inactivated by the same treatment. The PPO fraction obtained by HIC purification exhibited a pH optimum of 7. 5 with catechol and D,L-dopa as substrates and was stable in the pH range 4 to 8. Its temperature optima, were 20 and 30 °C respectively with D,L-dopa and catechol as substrates and this PPO fraction was able to retain 80 % of its original activity after heating at 50 °C for 10 min.
