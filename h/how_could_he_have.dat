6000|$|There {{were great}} exclamations of satisfaction, and gratitude; [...] "it {{was the very}} thing wanted, only <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> {{contrived}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{of course}} he's not. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> got from Rugby to London {{in time for}} a morning performance? Why, he's at St Austin's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think he}} did. Mr. Greenwood is the idlest human being that ever lived, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> {{performed}} {{the duties of}} a parish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because my predecessor, the American Maple White, {{actually}} made such an ascent. <b>How</b> otherwise <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> seen the monster which he sketched in his notebook?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... {5} There is some trifling {{inconsistency}} on the Major's part. Shah Allum was notoriously blind: <b>how,</b> then, <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> seen Gahagan? The {{thing is}} manifestly impossible.|$|R
6000|$|Tip reflected, as they journeyed on, {{that this}} was true. He began to regret that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not {{constructed}} the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially. Yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>have</b> guessed ...|$|R
60|$|Richard Baxter was too {{thoroughly}} {{good for}} any experience {{to make him}} worldly wise; else, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been simple enough to suppose, that Mazarine would leave such a question to be voted 'pro' and 'con', and decided by thirty emissaries in London! And, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> reconciled Mazarine's having any share in Charles's death with his own masterly account, pp. 98, 99, 100? Even Cromwell, though he might have prevented, could not have effected, the sentence. The regicidal judges were not his creatures. Consult the Life of Colonel Hutchinson upon this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, I am {{responsible}} for you. You must come with me. Oh, I trust {{he is not}} offended with me! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> got in without my seeing him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] {{said the}} country doctor. [...] "You are {{certainly}} right, sir. Then a third shot has been fired, {{and therefore a}} third person must have been present. But who could that have been, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> got away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Still, {{though the}} painter was assuredly not the father, might he {{not know who}} the father was, or <b>had</b> been? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{otherwise}} <b>have</b> got possession of Mary Grice's bracelet and Mary Grice's child? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Wow!' he {{said when}} he knew how the man had died. 'This lion's cub is a wizard also, for <b>how</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> killed a soldier who has known war? Hold out his arms that I may finish him slowly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He took {{a sudden}} step forward, his eyes gleaming, a faint flush glowing through the tan of his cheeks. Then <b>he</b> checked. Fool! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> so <b>have</b> misread her meaning {{even for a}} moment? Were not its exact limits abundantly plain, even without the words which she added a moment later? ...|$|R
6000|$|The palmist {{examines}} our hand. [...] "You {{will go a}} journey," [...] {{he tells}} us. It is marvellous! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> known that only the night before we had been discussing the advisability of taking the children to Margate for the holidays? ...|$|E
6000|$|The head post-office, {{to which}} he had sent her because it was late, was two or three streets off, and he had made his request in the most general manner, which she had acceded to with alacrity enough. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> done such an unreflecting thing? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{tell you}} that I heard him in here early in the afternoon, and the darkey told me his team was in the stable. Now, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> gotten the {{glycerine}} or cartridges out of here while six {{of us have been}} on duty all the time?" ...|$|E
60|$|Granville {{fell back}} on his wooden pillow with a horrible groan of awakened distrust. The man had gone off, that was clear, and had stolen his {{diamonds}} That is what comes of intrusting your life and property to a discovered murderer. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>have</b> been such a fool? He would never forgive himself.|$|R
5000|$|Cylinder {{reflects}} {{the pressure that}} Babylonian citizens were able to bring {{to bear on the}} new royal claimant … In this context, the reign of the defeated predecessor was automatically described as bad and against the divine will - <b>how</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been defeated? By implication, of course, all his acts became, inevitably and retrospectively, tainted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> taken you out hunting {{unless you}} <b>had</b> been here? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> and you <b>have</b> {{known each other}} at all unless I had been kind to you? Now you will understand." ...|$|R
60|$|Of trickery, of deception, {{he had not}} one thought. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have?</b> The {{events of}} the past hours had {{prepared}} him for this scene, and he had had only a brief vision in semi-darkness, whilst everything had been carefully prepared to blind him completely by this dastardly trick.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} {{hope you}} may. There is nothing I wish for Mary {{so much as}} {{that she should have}} a sister. And there is no one whom I would be so glad to hear her call by that name as yourself." [...] <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> spoken plainer? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is that {{schoolmaster}} {{who is at}} {{the bottom}} of it," [...] he muttered. [...] "He was a traitor, and I thought we hung him, but I suppose we didn't. Perhaps he got down, after we had gone off. If not, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> betrayed us again? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible, Chapeau, quite impossible. <b>How</b> {{on earth}} <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> got {{the means to}} raise a troop of men in Brittany? Besides, <b>he</b> never would <b>have</b> {{returned}} to the side he deserted." ...|$|R
50|$|Later, Hergé regretted {{explicitly}} {{depicting the}} alien space craft {{at the end}} of the story, although was unsure <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ended the story without it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But could a {{child of}} that age have a soul like that? I don't see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> managed it in the time. What do you think, Jeeves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will--I will," [...] said Herbert. [...] "But {{if it had}} {{happened}} a month since I could have borne it." [...] And then {{he thought of his}} mother, and hated himself for what he had said. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> borne that with patience? [...] "And there is no doubt, you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> forgotten, {{even for}} a moment? This was not the world which {{he had come to}} discover. This was just some plague-spot upon which he had stumbled. Through the murky dawn and across the ugly streets he looked into Louise's drawing-room. She would be there waiting for him on the morrow! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> let her {{go through}} those ten years of living death while he walked the streets scot free? Some time during the trial--the {{evidence}} piling up against her day by day--why didn't he come forward, if only to stand beside her? Get himself hanged, if only out of mere decency?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Tom, {{wondering}} in his {{own mind}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> brought himself for one moment to think evil of this kindly and righteous old man.|$|R
6000|$|Phineas {{certainly}} had never dared to speak, even to himself, {{of such a}} hope. The labours of the Bar had to be encountered before the dawn of such a hope could come to him. And <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gradually learned to feel that his prospects at the Bar were not as yet very promising. As regarded professional work <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been idle, and <b>how</b> then <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> a hope? ...|$|R
6000|$|LEO. I said slovenly habits. I {{never thought}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> really low tastes until I saw that woman in court. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen such a {{creature}} {{and let her}} write to him after-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what it means," [...] said Hal. [...] "He is trying to prove an alibi, in case a body was found in the vat. He thinks you can {{remember}} he was here looking for Macklin at quarter to six. If that was true, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> helped Macklin at five o'clock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{meanwhile}} {{had thought}} it out. [...] "Then he has something to be careful of; it would take something really handsome to inspire in a man like him that sort of interest. With his small expenses all these years his savings must be immense. And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> proposed to mamma unless he had originally had money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor," [...] said Lord John, [...] "is there much {{doubt as}} to how he met his death. He has fallen or been chucked from the top, and so been impaled. How else could he come by his broken bones, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He sees a {{beautiful}} face and thinks {{he will never}} forget it, but {{in a few weeks}} the feeling passes off, and <b>he</b> wonders <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> cared for anybody so absurdly much.' ...|$|R
60|$|What {{would you}} have? the Colonel asked piteously, {{in the dead}} of night, of his own conscience. <b>How</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> acted? <b>He</b> said nothing. That was all, mind you, he {{declared}} to himself more than once in his own soul. He told no lies. He made no complications. While the Admiral lived, he brought up Lucy's sons, quite privately, at Plymouth. And as soon as ever the Admiral died, he really and truly meant to acknowledge them.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{newspaper}} Folha de S.Paulo acquired {{copies of}} letters Moqbel {{had written to}} his lawyers.They quoted his confusion as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been cleared for release over five years ago, yet still remain in detention.|$|R
