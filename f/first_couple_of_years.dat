5|$|Even in the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> of his company, Goldfaden did not {{shy away}} from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with {{the theme of the}} press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E

He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Palliative care is an {{approach}} that improves {{the quality of life}} of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. Palliative care must be a part of every medical personnel’s practice. But still medical education curriculums have not included palliative care in its syllabus, sufficiently due to which most of the health professional are not aware about this specialty. The purpose of this study is to find out the perception of the medical students in palliative care in a teaching hospital. &# 13; Methods: A descriptive study was done among 270 undergraduate medical students studying in Institute of Medicine using a self structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed by using SPSS 21. &# 13; Results: Of the total 270 undergraduate medical students only 152 has heard the word “palliative care”. Only 84 students know, palliative care can be provided early in the life threatening illness. Total 80 students know it doesn’t intend to postpone and hasten death. Though only 49 students didn’t know PC is not included in our curriculum, 227 are interested to learn about it if given any opportunity. &# 13; Conclusions: The perception of palliative care medicine is low in <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> medical study. It is increased in clinically exposed students but is surprisingly more in fourth year than final year undergraduate medical students. However, it should be included in undergraduate medical study. &# 13; Keywords: medical students; palliative care; perception...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} base of {{the economy of the}} South Pacific islands, and a {{subsistence}} system of mixed cropping, starchy root crops mixed with banana, breadfruit and coconut, {{is the main}}stay. Farmers use a variety of local resources to maintain soil fertility, but external inputs can increase fertility, says Stanley Weeraratna of the University of the South Pacific. Crop yields on newly-cleared land are high, but decline sharply after the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>year's</b> cropping. Constraints on available space mean that the same land is cropped over and over again without fallowing. Mulches of dadap leaves, grass, weeds, dried coconut fronds, banana and breadfruit leaves at 30 tonnes per hectare can increase yields by up to 65 %. In atolls where organic materials are limited farmers use shredded coconut logs, wood chips and coconut husks. Poultry and pig manure is used where available. Organic fertilizer in the form of mulch has to be applied in large quantities, and it is sometimes necessary to replenish the soil nutrients that are removed with the biomass in the form of inorganic and/or organic fertilizers as an external input. Results of studies indicate that a mixture of local and external inputs obtain the maximum benefits from local resources.
