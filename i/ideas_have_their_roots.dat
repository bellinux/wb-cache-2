Many of these <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted {{that the first}} mathematical reference to splines is the 1946 paper by Schoenberg, which is probably the first place that the word [...] "spline" [...] is used in connection with smooth, piecewise polynomial approximation. However, the <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. In the foreword to (Bartels et al., 1987), Robin Forrest describes [...] "lofting", a technique used in the British aircraft industry during World War II to construct templates for airplanes by passing thin wooden strips (called [...] "splines") through points {{laid out on the}} floor of a large design loft, a technique borrowed from ship-hull design. For years the practice of ship design had employed models to design in the small. The successful design was then plotted on graph paper and the key points of the plot were re-plotted on larger graph paper to full size. The thin wooden strips provided an interpolation of the key points into smooth curves. The strips would be held in place at discrete points (called [...] "ducks" [...] by Forrest; Schoenberg used [...] "dogs" [...] or [...] "rats") and between these points would assume shapes of minimum strain energy. According to Forrest, one possible impetus for a mathematical model for this process was the potential loss of the critical design components for an entire aircraft should the loft be hit by an enemy bomb. This gave rise to [...] "conic lofting", which used conic sections to model the position of the curve between the ducks. Conic lofting was replaced by what we would call splines in the early 1960s based on work by J. C. Ferguson at Boeing and (somewhat later) by M.A. Sabin at British Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Various linear enigmas {{exist in}} ancient sacred landscapes world-wide. These include {{examples}} of Native American landscape lines, {{such as the}} Chacoan "roads", New Mexico, and the Nazca "lines", Peru; Neolithic linear earthworks, called "cursuses", in Britain; stone rows in Europe, Malaysia and elsewhere; temple alignments in Indonesia. There is also the ar-chaeologically heretical idea of "leys " (alignments of ancient sites), put for-ward by Englishman Alfred Watkins in 1921. Although the ley theory has long been derided by mainstream scholarship, new German and Dutch find-ings show {{that there was a}} medieval tradition of straight "Doodwegen " (death roads) or "Geisterwege " (ghost paths). It seems Watkins may have unwitting-ly uncovered vestiges of these features. Certainly Watkins had no concept of current "New Age " notions of "energy leylines", which are modem fantasies. It is argued that such medieval features arise out of a deep-seated, universal conceptual complex associating "spirit ways " with straight lines: straight cords and threads in ancient traditional healing practices as well as straight tracks and other ceremonial landscape markings. It is suggested that these <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in archaic shamanism, which, throughout Eurasia, in-fluenced later, ceremonial aspects of monarchy. A proto-Indo-European lan-guage vestige is cited. Preliminary evidence is presented indicating that the spirit- line associa-tion derived from the ecstatic "journey " experienced during the shamanic trance. This gave rise to images of "flying shamans " in tribal societies throughout the world, and, ultimately, to the "magical flight of the sovereign " in proto-state and state societies. It is this "flight of the soul " that seems to have been translated onto ancient sacred landscapes as straight lines, which later became variously acculturated as sacred ways, spirit and fairy paths, roads of the dead or of ghosts, or Royal Routes. The neuro-logical aspects of the so-called out-of-body state, and its possible associa-tion with modem psychological epidemics such as "UFO abductions", is al-luded to...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Two facts {{mark the}} {{emerging}} {{of the new}} status of mathematics education as a scientific discipline: the inauguration in 1969 of the tradition of International Congresses on Mathematical Education (ICMEs), and the contemporary launch of journals related to mathematics education research. The early ICMEs acted as catalysts for new <b>ideas</b> that <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in important events {{that took place in}} the 1950 s and 1960 s. As a consequence new issues found their place in the international discussion on mathematics education and opened new lines of research and forms of action inside ICMI, so that we may talk about a genuine ICMI Renaissance. In our contribution we examine the background and circumstances that fostered and shaped the emergence of the new issues that have developed in mathematics education up to the present day...|$|R
50|$|He {{explained}} {{later that}} the conception of an abstract thought occurs in the mind, through the concept of self. Following, the physical form is then recognized, communicating the form to the community. Then, the Objective compound occurs, delineating behavioral norms and artistic norms, becoming identifiable. Then the boundaries and axioms introduce logic and reasoning and decisions can be made: either inductive or deductive. Formalism follows, proving and convincing a decision about the object being perceived. The study done by Irwin suggested that: “…all <b>ideas</b> and values <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in experience,… they can be held separate at any point and developed directly {{on the grounds of}} function and use, both that they in fact remain relative to the condition of both our subjective and objective being.”Robert Irwin’s philosophy defined his idea of art as a series of aesthetic inquiries, an opportunity for cultural innovation, a communicative interaction with society, and as compounded historical development.|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} a {{popular in the}} Byzantine acritic songs (X–XII cc.) story about the fight of heroaristocrat with Charos is considered. The plot of the Digenes Akrites’ fight with Charos is a key point of acritic songs. There is a {{consolidated}} opinion in a modern historiography that acritic songs originate in the 10 th century and fix an original poetics of a military, acritic “estate”. Permanent military conflicts of “archons” of eastern provinces with troops of emirs of Tars and Melitin with the Paulicians, or Armenians, a constant military mobilization, contributed {{to the formation of}} a special militarized acritic culture, which is fully expressed in acritic songs praising the military courage, strength, valor and glory. The plot of the fight with Charos is the central point of the Byzantine aristocratic chthonic beliefs, and a set of folk representations (a solar theme, the theme of blood, theme of hair, topic breath and sighs) is organized around it. These <b>ideas</b> often <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>roots</b> in the ancient folklore, and the battle has an archaic base. Anyway, the fight with Charos is a whole concept of death and dying, which is organized on the basis of folk logic and is a clear expression of the Byzantine chthonic world. The plot of the fight with Charos raises the question of “class” differences in the Byzantine representations of death. The fight with the death is a complex of acritic and military aristocratic notions, when only death in the battle is a heroic death. In the cycle of arctic songs Charos is selective and emphasizes a social privilege of the hero-aristocrat...|$|R
