5|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{is a rare}} bird {{found in}} the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her {{co-workers}} used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to show that this pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant Lophura hatinhensis and the subspecies annamensis of the silver pheasant L. nycthemera.|$|E
25|$|Of the 59 {{recorded}} reptile and amphibian species, 18 {{are listed}} in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 {{are listed in}} the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. Further research has increased the species numbers markedly, and the number of recorded amphibian species is now 50 and that of reptile species 101. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including Danio quangbinhensis. The park is home to over 200 bird species, inclusive of several rare birds such as: chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, brown hornbill, sooty babbler and short-tailed scimitar babbler. There is good evidence for the Vietnamese pheasant (Lophura hatinhensis) and <b>imperial</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Lophura imperialis) species at Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park.|$|E

50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>{{pheasant}}</b> (Lophura × imperials) {{is a dark}} blue, medium-sized, up to 75 cm long pheasant {{with bare}} red facial skin, blue crest, crimson legs and glossy plumage. The female is brown with erectile short feather crest, blackish tail and primaries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{is found}} in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Its {{appearance}} resembles another of Vietnams enigmatic birds, the Vietnamese pheasant, but it is larger in size, has a longer tail, and an all dark blue crest and tail feathers. The latter species has a white crest and central tail feathers.|$|E

He was {{renowned for}} not only {{discovering}} but also rearing some of the rarest birds in the world. One of the birds he discovered was the <b>imperial</b> <b>pheasant,</b> later {{found to be a}} hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant and the silver pheasant.|$|E

50|$|Kẻ Gỗ Nature Reserve is {{a nature}} reserve in Vietnam. It {{is located in}} three districts of this province, namely: Cẩm Xuyên, Thạch Hà, Hương Khê. It was {{established}} by the Decision No. 519/QD-UB dated May 3, 1997 of the Ha Tinh People's Committee. The purpose of this establishment {{is to protect the}} endangered Vietnamese pheasant (Lophura hatinhensis) and the <b>imperial</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Lophura imperialis) as well as biodiversity in the southern area of this province. In this area, there exists nearly 100 species of amphibians and reptiles as shown by the German biologist Dr. Thomas Ziegler. Large mammals are rare, due to the high hunting pressure. So there is probably no more elephants. Ke Go is home to one of the last lowland rainforests of Vietnam. The management board includes about 70 persons, inclusive of 56 rangers. Illegal loggings, poaching and exploitation of oil threaten this habitat. The Netherlands and ORO-VERDE financially supported a project for the conservation of the reserve.|$|E
