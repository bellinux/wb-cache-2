5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

25|$|In October 1885, Freud went to Paris on a {{fellowship}} {{to study with}} Jean-Martin Charcot, a renowned neurologist who was conducting scientific research into hypnosis. He was later to recall the experience of this stay as catalytic in turning <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> practice of medical psychopathology and away from a less financially promising career in neurology research. Charcot specialized {{in the study of}} hysteria and susceptibility to hypnosis, which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage in front of an audience.|$|E
25|$|Nationalism and {{the rise}} of the Know Nothing Party or American Party was a feature of Louisiana {{politics}} in the 1850s. Whig newspapers tried to discredit Hébert by starting rumors of his allegiance with the Know Nothings. He still appointed some Whigs to minor offices and some Know Nothings to lucrative posts. He was considered very independent in his appointments and many Democrats were disenchanted with <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of his administration. Hébert was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U. S. Senate, but John Slidell was not vulnerable to an intraparty challenge.|$|E

25|$|Seemingly {{destined to}} become linked as implied by their names (Doro means “east” and Anyanwu means “sun”), they engage in a clash of wills that lasts over a century. Some critics read their {{struggle}} as that between “masculine” and “feminine” perspectives with Doro as the patriarch who controls and dominates his people and Anyanwu as the matriarch who nurtures and protects her own. Others see their relationship as resembling that of master and slave. Doro’s first assessment of Anyanwu, for example, is as valuable “wild seed,” whose genes will enhance his breeding experiments and so decides to “tame and breed her.” This master/slave dynamic becomes complicated once Anyanwu refuses to be submissive to Doro’s requests and protects his people against <b>him.</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> end of the novel, Doro realizes he cannot bend Anyanwu’s will and, admitting her worth, he relents some of his absolute power in order to reconcile with her.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Johnson started {{slowly at}} Rockingham Speedway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway with results of 41st and 16th, after a top ten {{finish in the}} Daytona 500. However, he quickly was able to rebound winning the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington Raceway. Subsequent {{victories}} in the Coca-Cola 600, the Pocono 500, and the Pennsylvania 500 came {{in the middle of}} the season, seeing Johnson sweep the Pocono races. However, finishes of 37th and 32nd at Talladega Superspeedway and Kansas moved <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the point standings. Afterward, he was able to win the UAW-GM Quality 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway. The second victory of the 2004 Chase for the Nextel Cup, at the Subway 500 at Martinsville on October 24, 2004, was marred by tragedy. Owner Rick Hendrick's son Ricky, twin nieces, brother, and chief engine builder Randy Dorton as well as Joe Turner, Scott Lathram were killed in an airplane crash en route to the race. All eight passengers and both pilots died in the incident, and Johnson was told after completion of the race. Johnson had a total of eight wins, 20 top five and 23 top ten finishes. At the end of the season, Johnson finished second in the point standings.|$|E
500|$|Herkimer's men {{eventually}} rallied, fighting {{their way}} out of the ravine to the crest just to its west. [...] John Johnson, concerned about the militia's tenacity, returned to the British camp and requested some reinforcements from St. Leger shortly before a thunderstorm broke out. [...] Another seventy men headed back with <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> battle. [...] The thunderstorm caused a one-hour break in the fighting, during which Herkimer regrouped his militia on the higher ground. [...] He instructed his men to fight in pairs: while one man fired and reloaded, the other waited and then only fired if attacked. Ordered to fire in relays, the pairs were to try to keep at least one weapon loaded at all times, to reduce the effectiveness of the tomahawk attacks.|$|E

500|$|Tensions between Crow {{and other}} members of the group began to arise {{following}} Crow's performance of [...] "Leaving Las Vegas" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman in March 1994. Crow offhandedly agreed with the host when she was asked if the track was autobiographical, even though it was primarily written by Baerwald and based on the book of the same name by his friend John O'Brien. As a result, several members of the Tuesday Music Club group felt betrayed, and O'Brien himself committed suicide three weeks later. Nevertheless, O'Brien's parents insisted that Crow had nothing to do with the tragedy, noting that he [...] "was just mad about it [...] But the problems that drove <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end were – you know, that's a long, long bloody trip." ...|$|E
500|$|Palpatine's wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films. In Attack of the Clones, explained McDiarmid, [...] "The costumes ... have got much more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had [...] So we see the trappings of power." [...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." [...] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that [...] "it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for [...]" [...] According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, [...] "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> dark side." ...|$|E
500|$|Texas' Spanish Royal Governor, Martín de Alarcón was {{the first}} {{documented}} European to tour the bay while exploring Matagorda Bay with Tejas guides in 1718. During the expedition, two Karankawa Indians were spotted near the bay going about their daily lives and were frightened {{at the sight of}} Alarcón and his men. [...] They quickly swam across the bay despite the guides' signal to them that Alarcón meant no harm. The next day, the Indians came ashore from a sixteen-passenger canoe (which could hold 4 men, 4 women and 8 children) and notified the Tejas guide that they wished for Alarcón and his men to leave. As a peace offering, Alarcón presented the Indians with tobacco and clothing on behalf of the Spanish crown, which they accepted. In exchange, the Indians offered Alarcón dried fish, and directed <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> former French fort of St. Louis, believing Alarcón wanted to establish a colony on the bay. Alarcón declared the bay for Spain, but did not establish a permanent settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Cole's renowned four-part series {{traces the}} journey of an archetypal hero along the [...] "River of Life." [...] Confidently {{assuming}} control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of [...] "Youth" [...] and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever-more-turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.|$|E
2500|$|The offseason for the Phillies {{began on}} October 7, {{following}} their devastating {{loss in the}} NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals. On November 5, the Phillies signed long-time veteran slugger Jim Thome to a 1-year deal, worth $1.25 million. Addiditionally, after numerous rumors, [...] on November 14 the Phillies signed RHP Jonathan Papelbon to a 4-year deal, worth $50 million. The Phillies also added pitcher Dontrelle Willis from the Cincinnati Reds, on a 1-year deal, worth 1 million dollars, but released <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of spring training. Laynce Nix was {{signed as a free}} agent and Ty Wigginton was acquired through a trade with the Colorado Rockies to shore up the bench. Several other veteran players including Dave Bush, Joel Piñeiro, Scott Elarton, Lou Montanez, and Scott Podsednik were signed to minor league deals with invitations to spring training.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{a federal}} appeals court, {{by a vote of}} two to one, upheld {{convictions}} that the three defendants were guilty as charged. Judge Newman, in rejecting the misconduct claims, stated that, [...] "As with all sting operations, government creation of the opportunity to commit an offense, {{even to the point of}} supplying defendants with materials essential to commit crimes, does not exceed due process limits.... agents would have been derelict in their duties if they did not test how far Cromitie would go to carry out his desires. When a government agent encounters a Muslim who volunteers that he wants to 'do something to America' or die like a martyr, the agent is entitled to probe the attitudes of that person to learn whether his religious views have impelled <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> violent brand of radical Islam that poses a dire threat to the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nabokov {{continues}} {{to express his}} scorn for the Soviet, indicating how he is a figure easily manipulated by others; the inability of a character to express his free will is a considerable crime for Nabokov. So {{not only does the}} reader observe that the Soviet's every emotion at the whim of Ivanov ("when he pressed the flat surface of the razor to the man's neck, his entire body twitched") but in the final paragraph, Ivanov seems to be able to control his foe physically. Petrified by the possibility of revenge being meted out, the Soviet cannot move until Ivanov commands it of him. Having done that the Russian barber [...] "clapped the bowler on his head, thrust the briefcase under his arm, and swivelled <b>him</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door." [...] On leaving the barber's, descriptions of the Soviet further emphasise his robotic demeanour. Eyes completely shut, [...] "he stepped like an automaton", [...] "with the same mechanical gait" [...] and [...] "with an outstretched petrified hand". Each of these descriptions demonstrate the Soviet as being a non-individual, without free will, who can be manipulated and controlled by others. The political subtext of Nabokov's characterisation [...] communists simply follow the herd rather than think for themselves [...] becomes clearer.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor {{swallows}} {{the small}} piece of Shalka he removed from Alison's forehead. [...] He bonds with it, reprogramming it {{to do what he}} wants.

[...] He activates the black hole, sucking in Prime and sending her to her death. [...] Alison stops the black hole and the Doctor coughs up the piece of Shalka. [...] He puts it back in Alison's head, where she fights off the remaining Shalka and shuts down the screams. [...] The Doctor unplugs her a few moments before she can reprogram the scream to heal the atmosphere. [...] He tells her that she cannot be allowed that much power. [...] On board the TARDIS, the Master reveals that {{it has been a long}} time since the Doctor had a living companion. [...] His last companion was killed in the events that also led to the Master choosing to have his consciousness placed in the android and to the Doctor's exile. [...] Without being specific, the Master tells her that they are being controlled by an unknown force and the Doctor wants Alison to stay as his companion but he won't ask her to. [...] After they land, Joe arrives and Alison tells him she is leaving with the Doctor because she is bored and wants to see the universe. [...] Joe reluctantly accepts her decision and a kiss before the Master begins the TARDIS dematerializing cycle and they board the craft.|$|E
