5|$|Coutances {{was born}} in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice {{during the reign of}} King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.|$|E

Foliot's participation in legal affairs led him in 1153 to employ a clerk specialising in Roman law.|$|E

Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E

2500|$|Soon, Mattarella became isolated. The {{inspector}} he {{had asked}} to conduct {{an investigation into the}} public contracts in Palermo, Raimondo Mignosi, recalled the air of intimidation at the time: “I told him to be careful because I ran the risk of <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a cement block, at which he replied, ‘That’s not true, I’ll <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the cement.’ To break the tension, we jokingly agreed that we would both <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> cement blocks side by side.” ...|$|R

5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E

In the mid 1970s - 1980s they were traced down and sold abroad. The last known one left Sweden in 1992.

5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the possession of General George S.

During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well.

In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E

It saw use once again in World War II, when parts of it were destroyed by aerial bombardment. After it was decommissioned in the 1960s, the fort was used for industrial purposes. Today, the fort remains mostly intact but in a dilapidated state, and it is used as a filming location and a tank cleaning facility.|$|E
