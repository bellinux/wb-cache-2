500|$|His biographer, Thomas D. Weist, agrees, {{saying that}} even after his books {{had gone out of}} print, [...] "anthropologists, historians, and avid readers of western history {{continued}} to seek them out in libraries for their myriad details on the Cheyennes, the Crows, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn." [...] Edgar I. Stewart says Marquis is [...] "one of the ablest students of the American Indian". Liberty says that he is [...] "well trusted generally, as a historian..."

500|$|Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped {{inspire the}} Viking metal scene through his {{strongly}} held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his {{longing for a}} return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, [...] "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." [...] They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes [...] "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with [...] "an eye on Mein Kampf". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, [...] "proving both that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator".|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> {{women in}} his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel {{as a form of}} tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E

2500|$|Ingres's {{style was}} formed {{early in life}} and changed {{comparatively}} little. His earliest drawings, such as the Portrait of a Man (or Portrait of an unknown, 3July 1797, now in the Louvre) already show a suavity of outline and an extraordinary control of the parallel hatchings which model the forms. From the first, his paintings are characterized by a firmness of outline reflecting his often-quoted conviction that [...] "drawing is the probity of art". He believed colour {{to be no more}} than an accessory to drawing, explaining: [...] "Drawing is not just reproducing contours, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> line; drawing is also the expression, the inner form, the composition, the modelling. See what is left after that. Drawing is seven eighths of what makes up painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, merely having {{a large number}} of {{interactions}} is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour; many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant, or may cancel each other out. [...] In some cases, {{a large number of}} interactions can in fact work against the emergence of interesting behaviour, by creating a lot of [...] "noise" [...] to drown out any emerging [...] "signal"; the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to be self-supporting. Thus <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence; it is also how these connections are organised. [...] A hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour (a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite {{different from that of the}} individual humans in that bureaucracy); but perhaps more interestingly, emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures, such as a marketplace. [...] In some cases, the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity, organisation, and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{contributor}} to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe-box room and tight stockings that apply {{pressure to the}} top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, {{whether or not the}} nail is truly [...] "ingrown". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing {{to the end of the}} nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.|$|E

6000|$|The {{business}} of the mind {{is first and foremost}} the pure joy of knowing and comprehending the pure joy of consciousness. The second business is to act as medium, as interpreter, as agent between the individual and his object. The mind should not act as a director or controller of the spontaneous centers. These the soul alone must control: the soul being that forever unknowable reality which causes us to rise into being. There is continual conflict between the soul, which is for ever sending forth incalculable impulses, and the psyche, which is conservative, and wishes to persist in its old motions, and the mind, which wishes to have [...] "freedom," [...] that is spasmodic, idea-driven control. Mind, and conservative psyche, and the incalculable soul, these three are a trinity of powers in every human being. But there is something even beyond these. It is the individual in his pure singleness, in his totality of consciousness, in his oneness of being: the Holy Ghost which is with us after our Pentecost, and which we may not deny. When I say to myself: [...] "I am wrong," [...] knowing with sudden insight that I am wrong, then this is the whole self speaking, the Holy Ghost. It is no piece of mental inference. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> soul sending forth a flash. It is my whole being speaking in one voice, soul and mind and psyche transfigured into oneness. This voice of my being I may never deny. When at last, in all my storms, my whole self speaks, then there is a pause. The soul collects itself into pure silence and isolation--perhaps after much pain. The mind suspends its knowledge, and waits. The psyche becomes strangely still. And then, after the pause, there is fresh beginning, a new life adjustment. Conscience is the being's consciousness, when the individual is conscious in toto, when he knows in full. It is something which includes and which far surpasses mental consciousness. Every man must live as far as he can by his own soul's conscience. But not according to any ideal. To submit the conscience to a creed, or an idea, or a tradition, or even an impulse, is our ruin.|$|E
