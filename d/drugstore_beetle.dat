5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> has a {{worldwide}} distribution {{though it is}} more common in warmer climates. It is similar in appearance to the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), but is slightly larger (adults can be up to 3.5 mm in length). Additionally, drugstore beetles have antennae ending in 3-segmented clubs, while cigarette beetles have serrated antennae (notched like teeth of a saw). The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> also has grooves running longitudinally along the elytra, whereas the cigarette beetle is smooth.|$|E

50|$|The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle's</b> larvae are small, white grubs, {{that can}} be {{distinguished}} from the grubs of the cigarette beetle by their shorter hair. The female can lay up to 75 eggs at once, and the larval period lasts up to several months depending on the food source. It is the larvae {{that are responsible for}} most of the damage that this species can cause.|$|R
50|$|The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> {{lives in}} {{obligatory}} symbiosis with a yeast fungus, which is passed onto the offspring by covering the eggs with it.|$|E
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> has a {{tendency}} to feed on pharmacological products, this is from its preference of dried herbs and plant material sometimes used as drugs, e.g. drugstore beetles have been known to feed on strychnine, a highly toxic herbal extract. It can also feed on a diverse range of dried foods and spices, as well as hair, leather, books, and museum specimens. It can bore into furniture and in some cases tin foil or sheets of lead. The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> is also known as the biscuit or bread beetle since it can happily live on biscuit or bread crumbs.|$|E
50|$|Lasioderma serricorne, {{commonly}} known as the cigarette beetle, cigar beetle, or tobacco beetle, is an insect very similar in appearance to the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum) and the common furniture beetle (Anobium punctatum). All three species belong to the family Anobiidae.|$|E
50|$|Food storage {{areas like}} pantries and {{cabinets}} {{need to be}} vacuumed thoroughly, including the crevices between floor boards, the corners of cabinets, and areas where mice may have hoarded things like dry dog food. A bird nest within a home can also provide a haven for <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetles,</b> and a professional {{may need to be}} consulted to address this. Lowering home humidity levels can be helpful as well. While the use of chemical insecticides may be undesirable in food storage areas, Food Grade diatomaceous earth can be useful sprinkled in corners or even mixed into bird seed (diatomaceous earth is edible, but inhaling it should be avoided).|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} method of ridding a home of this beetle {{is to try}} to discover the source of the infestation. <b>Drugstore</b> <b>beetles</b> often enter a home in bulk items like bird seed, grass seed, or dry pet food, where several generations of beetles can develop unnoticed until some of the adults eventually leave to infest new locations. Telltale signs of infested items are shot-like holes puncturing the outside packaging of food items and pockmarking solid items like crackers and pasta, as well as loose powder at the bottom of storage bags. While adult beetles do not feed, they are adept at chewing holes.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the initial feasibility tests performed using a commercial acoustic emission instrument {{for the purpose}} of detecting beetles in Department of Energy 9975 shipping packages. The device selected for this testing was a commercial handheld instrument and probe developed for the detection of termites, weevils, beetles and other insect infestations in wooden structures, trees, plants and soil. The results of two rounds of testing are presented. The first tests were performed by the vendor using only the hand-held instrument’s indications and real-time operator analysis of the audio signal content. The second tests included hands-free positioning of the instrument probe and post-collection analysis of the recorded audio signal content including audio background comparisons. The test results indicate that the system is promising for detecting the presence of <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetles,</b> however, additional work would be needed to improve the ease of detection and to automate the signal processing to eliminate the need for human interpretation. Mechanisms for hands-free positioning of the probe and audio background discrimination are also necessary for reliable detection and to reduce potential operator dose in radiation environments...|$|R
5000|$|Stored product pests: The {{most common}} stored product pests or pantry pests are the {{cigarette}} beetle and the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle.</b> These pests {{are known to}} infest “seeds, nuts, grains, spices, dried fruits, and vegetables," [...] items which many museums include.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum), {{also known}} as the bread beetle or biscuit beetle, is a tiny, brown beetle that can be found infesting a wide variety of dried plant products, where it is among the most common non-weevils to be found. It is {{the only member of the}} {{monotypic}} genus Stegobium.|$|E
50|$|Home stored product {{entomology}} is {{the study}} of insects which infest foodstuffs stored in the home. It deals with the prevention, detection and eradication of the pests. The five major categories of insects considered in this article are flour beetles, the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> the sawtoothed grain beetle, the Indian meal moth and fruit flies.|$|E
50|$|This beetle {{is related}} to the {{commonly}} known cigarette beetle. Adult drugstore beetles are cylindrical with lengths ranging from 2.25 to 3.5 mm. They are a reddish-brown color and have elytra, sclerotized (hardened) wings that fold back over the abdomen and hinge upwards, allowing the hind wings to come out to fly. Females are capable of laying up to 75 eggs during a 13- to 65-day period. After the eggs are laid, they hatch into a larval period that can range anywhere from four to 20 weeks. After the larval period, <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae move out of the substrate to build a cocoon and pupate. The pupation period takes a total of 12-18 days. The entire life cycle of the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> lasts approximately two months, but can be as long as seven months. These stored product pests will infest almost anything readily available. Food products prone to infestation include: flours, dry mixes, breads, cookies and other spices. Nonfood material includes: wool, hair, leather and museum specimens. This specific type of beetle has symbiotic yeasts that produce B vitamins, which allow the beetle to survive even when consuming foods of low nutritional value. They are found in areas that have a warmer climate, yet are less plentiful in the tropics than the cigarette beetle.|$|E
50|$|Strychnine {{poisoning}} {{in animals}} usually occurs from ingestion of baits {{designed for use}} against gophers, moles, and coyotes. Strychnine is also used as a rodenticide, but is not specific to such unwanted pests and may kill other small animals. In the United States, most baits containing strychnine have been replaced with zinc phosphide baits since 1990. In the Netherlands, rodenticides with strychnine are forbidden. Some animals are immune to strychnine, usually these are species such as fruit bats that have evolved resistance to poisonous alkaloids in the fruit they eat. The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> has a symbiotic gut yeast that allows it to digest pure strychnine.|$|E
50|$|To {{identify}} an insect, {{and consequently}} {{make a decision}} about the type of control to be implemented, the type of food must first be noted, especially {{in the absence of a}} specimen. Although identifying the food is a general start to begin to identify the insect, it must be remembered that it is not always the most accurate method, but is mostly used as a guideline, as some insects are more likely than others to be found in certain types of grain, flour, etc. The type of food is not always conclusive to the type of insect found in it, as insects are not extremely picky, and many families and species are found on a wide range of different foodstuffs. Using the infested item as a guideline, noting the type of damage done to the product is the next step. Some insects, like the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> leave telltale tiny holes in the damaged product, while Indianmeal moths are notorious for the spider web-like threads left behind in the food they infest. These observations can generally lead to a mostly accurate conclusion about the type of insects causing the damage, but obviously the most accurate conclusion relies on any specimen found either directly in the stored product or in the vicinity. The larvae, pupae, and adults can be found directly in the product while usually only the pupae and adults are found in the vicinity of the product. It is not practical to assume any person has knowledge of general entomology, so the following analysis focuses on the five major pests that most commonly infest stored products, beginning with the type of foods infested, signs indicative of a particular insect infestation, and a description of the larvae, pupae, and adults, including behavior, as well as appearance.|$|E

40|$|Recently (January 2010), we {{have found}} that <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> Stegobium paniceum (L.), is a serious pest of old books in a {{religious}} library in Cracow, Poland. About 80 % old books were found more or less damaged by this pest. As the result of larval activity, many holes and tunnels were formed in damaged books. Some of them were old, some of them were new tunnels with live larvae and pupae. Many characteristic emergence holes of the adults were found in the book bindings. Around books there was an enormous amount of dust as a result of larval feeding activity. Live and dead adults were found around old books and within the library room, especially near windows.

40|$|Predicting {{mortality}} or {{survival rate}} of insects at heat treatment temperatures {{is critical for}} commercial heat treatment of food and storage facilities. Two models were developed to predict the survival rate of young larvae of <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> Stegobium paniceum (L.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) under steady state or transient temperature condition: modified fundamental kinetic model and modified complementary loglog transformation model. Published young larvae mortalities and raw data of the temperature history, determined at different heat treatment temperatures, were used to develop these models. The models were verified and compared by using the field data collected in a medium sized mill. Both of the developed models overestimated the insect mortality in the mill when temperature was > 53 °C and underestimated insect mortality when temperature was < 50 °C. The lowest mean of the absolute difference between the predicted and measured insect mortality in the mill was 16. 7 ± 1. 1 % which was generated by using the modified complementary log-log transformation model. The possible reason of this divergence from the model is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Although high {{concentrations}} of zinc and manganese were found in mandibles of insect larvae that bore into seeds, these metals were not detected in mandibles of insect larvae that attack previously damaged seeds. Metals {{were present in the}} larval mandibles of a lepidopteran, the Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella), and eight coleopterans, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> (Stegobium paniceum), spider beetle (Gibbium aequinoctiale), warehouse beetle (Trogoderma variabile), cadelle (Tenebroides mauritanicus), larger black flour beetle (Cynaeus angustus), and cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus). Larvae of these species can chew into seeds. Larvae of six other coleopterans, the varied carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci), sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis), rusty grain beetle (Cryptolestes ferrugineus), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), longheaded flour beetle (Latheticus oryzae), and granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius) have little if any ability to chew into seeds, and did not have metal in their mandibles. Larvae of the granary weevil hatch and feed within seeds that were penetrated previously during egg deposition by adults.

40|$|Stored {{products}} may be prone for insect damage. Storage {{management and}} process-ing of organic products allow {{the use of}} chemicals in empty storage rooms only. Bene-ficial insects might be an alternative in special environments and for direct control in and on organic produce. The deliberate release of beneficial insects in storage rooms has not been tested to a large extend and if so, in small enterprises only. In the time span 2006 - 2008, a practical approach for the control of stored-product pest insects is followed amongst others in a pasta factory and a large bakery in Switzerland. Part of the project is the establishment of laboratory-mass-reared parasitoids and predators, e. g. the parasitic wasp Anisopteromalus calandrae for {{the control of the}} <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> Stegobium paniceum and the parasitic wasp Trichogramma evanescens for the control of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella. The objectives of the project are i) the development of release strategies of beneficial insects in the organic food proc-essing industry in order to prevent pesticide applications and ii) the establishment of a guidance document on the maintenance of beneficial insects prior and during release, the preparation of facilities and the inclusion of employees. To date, results have not yet been evaluated. However, the stored-product pest insects were kept in check by the released beneficial insects. In none of the environments tested, pesticides were applied...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{enemies are}} known from many {{cultural}} heritage pests, but {{their potential for}} biological control has been marginally exploited only. In this publication, examples of practical and commercial application of parasitoids of beetles and moths are compiled as well as laboratory research {{that contributes to the}} development of guidelines for parasitoid releases. One the one hand there are parasitoids found to occur simultaneously with the pests in buildings, on the other hand there are parasitoids that were never found {{to be associated with the}} respective pests but accept them if brought into the cultural heritage environments. An example for the latter is the egg parasitoid Trichogramma evanescens euproctidis, a parasitoid of moth eggs including those of the cloth moth Tineola bisselliella. In semi-field trials it was shown that inundative releases of the egg parasitoids are necessary and that effectiveness is reduced on thick cloth with long strand. Trichogramma release units have to be placed directly on the cloth to be protected. A naturally occuring parasitoid of Anobiid beetles is the pteromalid larval parasitoid Lariophagus distinguendus. This parasitoid was applied against the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle</b> Stegobium paniceum in historic libraries and against spider beetles (Ptininae) in historic buildings. A simulation model for the population-dynamics of L. distinguendus and the golden spider beetle Niptus hololeucus is presented. Finally, monitoring of the Braconid larval parasitoid Spathius exarator used for indirect monitoring of the common furniture beetle Anobium punctatum is described. The future potential of parasitoids to control cultural heritage pests is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify and study a species of Anobiidae that causes great damage and is a cause of concern as an urban pest in Brazil. This species has been found infesting wood, furniture, doors, books, insect collections, tea, dried fruits, handcrafts, and many other commodities. Inspections were done in houses and storehouses in the city of Curitiba, PR, Brazil in order to collect objects and materials that present signs of anobiid attack. The only species identified was Tricorynus rudepunctatus (Coleoptera: Anobiidae). There is only one reference to this species in the central region of Brazil. Another anobiid, the book pest Tricorynus herbarius has been recorded attacking books and historical documents and Tricorynus sp. attacking forest trees, but it was not recorded in our survey. Usually, the damage caused by T. rudepunctatus is mistaken with damage by termites; and when the insect is collected it is frequently misidentified as T. herbarius or as the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne or even as Stegobium paniceum, the <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle.</b> Some morphological characters useful to identify T. rudepunctatus are: oval body about 2. 7 mm long; dark brown with smooth hairs all over the body; head concealed under the pronotum; 10 -segmented antenna with the three apical segments forming a 3 -segmented loose club; elytra with two grooves at the posterior edge; fore femur with a transversal line on its anterior face; pro and mesotibia with two distinct striae; metasternum longitudinally carinate in the middle.

40|$|Botanicals; dried plants, roots, stems, leaves, {{seeds and}} flowers, {{have been used}} from the dawn of history as drugs or spices (Craker, 2007). Botanicals {{have been used in}} the health care system to improve blood circulation, reduce chronic fever and cure chronic {{constipation}} (Golob et al., 1999; Samy et al., 2008). The <b>drugstore</b> <b>beetle,</b> Stegobium paniceum (L.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae), is a pest of stored medicinal and aromatic plants {{and one of the most}} common insects found in botanical warehouses (Abdelghany et al., 2010). Generally, mortality of each stage increased with an increase of temperature and exposure time. Heat tolerance for different stages from highest to lowest was; young larvae, old larvae, eggs, adult and pupae. The mortality after 7 h, at 42 ºC for young larvae, old larvae, eggs, adult and pupae respectively was; 16 ± 5, 31 ± 6, 48 ± 3, 63 ± 8 and 86 ± 2 % (mean + SEM). Similarly, the lethal time for 90 % mortality (LT 90) at 42 ºC was; too low to estimate, 773, 144, 12 and 11 h. The LT 90 value for young larvae at 42, 45, 50, 55 and 60 ºC was 25, 20, 3. 9, 0. 18 and 0. 08 h respectively. The cold tolerance of different stages at 0 ºC from highest to lowest was adult, old larva, young larva, pupa, and egg. The LT 90 at 0 ºC was 298, 153, 151, 89 and 53 h, respectively. The LT 90 value for adults at 5, - 5, - 10 and - 15 ºC was 792, 58, 2 and 0. 8 h, respectively. The supercooling point of adults, young larvae, old larvae and pupae was - 15. 2 ± 2 ºC, - 9. 0 ± 0. 8 ºC, - 6. 5 ± 0. 5 ºC, and - 4. 0 ± 1. 4 ºC respectively. Heat treatments that control young larvae should control all other stages of S. paniceum. Cold treatments that control adults should control all other stages of S. paniceum. Dried plants stored at 5 ºC for 45 days or 42 ºC for 30 h and then kept below 18 ºC throughout the rest of the year, should remain pest-free without any chemical control.
