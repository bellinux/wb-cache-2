5|$|The Patagonian {{climate is}} {{classified}} as arid to semi-arid and temperate to cool temperate. One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are {{at roughly the same}} speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E

5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} form in Western {{countries}} is infant botulism.

25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in {{what is known as}} a boundary layer {{in the case of a}} bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{collecting}} of sculpture, {{including that}} of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern museum was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, {{and the ability to}} transport and store the increasingly large works <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> their construction. Small decorative figurines, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by modern and Contemporary art) {{as they were in the}} Rococo, or in ancient Greece when Tanagra figurines were a major industry, or in East Asian and Pre-Columbian art. Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the Nimrud ivories, Begram ivories and finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.|$|E
25|$|Ease {{of voting}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters {{must go through}} {{separate}} voter registration procedures before {{they are allowed to}} vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
