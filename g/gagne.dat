5|$|After Quantrill {{became a}} free agent, Mota became the setup man for <b>Gagné</b> in 2004. He started {{the season with}} eight {{straight}} scoreless games. From June 27 to July 16, he did not allow a run in 10 straight games. On July 29, he started a career-high five-game winning streak {{when he got a}} win by pitching two scoreless innings in a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He was the winning pitcher when he pitched two scoreless innings in an 8–5 victory over the Anaheim Angels on July 3 in a game notable for <b>Gagné</b> getting the final save of his 84 straight converted save chances. On July 30, a day before the trade deadline, Mota had a 2.14 ERA in 52 games. That day, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with Juan Encarnación and Paul Lo Duca for Hee-seop Choi, Brad Penny, and Bill Murphy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{e-learning}} content for advertising theory applying <b>Gagné's</b> Nine Events of Instruction, and to apply it to advertising courses offered in college programs. In advertising courses, emotional appeals based on visual images and multimedia materials are becoming more important. In addition, e-learning content is becoming important in educational programs, but most of the content is not based upon the principles of instruction models for the learners. This study, therefore, has developed e-learning content for advertising theory while applying <b>Gagné’s</b> ‘Nine Events of Instruction’. The results of this research indicate how <b>Gagné's</b> principles can be applied to content for advertising theory. To measure the content’s efficiency, questionnaires given to 120 advertising majors were analyzed. The results can be summarized as follows. First, the e-learning content for advertising theory had positive learning effects on the students. Second, <b>Gagné’s</b> Nine Steps of Instruction produced effective classroom participation among the students. Third, the content provided an effective learning atmosphere for the students, and learning activities were activated among the learners. In conclusion, this research has found that e-learning content applying <b>Gagné's</b> Nine Events of Instruction worked properly in the advertising classes. Most importantly, the effectiveness of the content depends upon the reflection of the principles on the instruction model...|$|R
50|$|Robert <b>Gagné's</b> work {{is widely}} used and cited {{in the design of}} instruction, as {{exemplified}} by more than 130 citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from 1985 through 1990. Synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism, he provided a clear template, which is easy to follow for designing instructional events. Instructional designers who follow <b>Gagné's</b> theory will likely have tightly focused, efficient instruction.|$|R
5|$|As the 2002 trade {{deadline}} approached, teams {{interested in}} acquiring Shuey began to inquire on his availability. On July 28, 2002, before the trade deadline, Shuey {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for Terry Mulholland and minor leaguers Ricardo Rodríguez and Francisco Cruceta. With the Dodgers in the playoff chase that season, they hoped to pair him with closer Éric <b>Gagné</b> to form a strong bullpen for the later portions of games.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Mike Marshall won the award, {{becoming}} the first relief pitcher to win the award. In 1992, Dennis Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth-inning situations) to win the award, and since then only one other relief pitcher has won the award, Éric <b>Gagné</b> in 2003 (also a closer). A total of nine relief pitchers have won the Cy Young Award across both leagues.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural award {{winners were}} Bill Campbell (AL) and Rawly Eastwick (NL); Campbell also {{won in the}} {{following}} season. Dan Quisenberry and Mariano Rivera each won the AL award five times, while Rollie Fingers and Bruce Sutter won the award four times each. Lee Smith won the award on three occasions; Campbell, Dennis Eckersley, Dave Righetti, John Franco, Éric <b>Gagné,</b> Randy Myers, Trevor Hoffman, Francisco Rodríguez, Heath Bell, and José Valverde each won the award twice. Sutter (NL 1979), Fingers (AL 1981), Steve Bedrosian (NL 1987), Mark Davis (NL 1989), Eckersley (AL 1992), and Éric <b>Gagné</b> (NL 2003) won the Relief Man and the Cy Young Award in the same season; Fingers and Eckersley won the AL MVP as well, in 1981 and 1992 respectively. Todd Worrell won both the Relief Man and the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in the 1986 MLB season. Rivera and Joe Nathan were the only relief pitchers to have tied in points for the award, and both were awarded in 2009. Goose Gossage, Fingers, Eckersley, and Sutter were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Craig Kimbrel (NL) and Jim Johnson (AL) were the final award winners in 2012. Sanofi acquired Rolaids from Johnson & Johnson unit McNeil Consumer Healthcare in 2013, but the award was not continued {{as a part of}} its marketing strategy.|$|E
40|$|The {{work being}} {{presented}} here intended {{to investigate the}} role of <b>Gagne’s</b> events of instruction in the teaching learning process. The focus {{of this study was}} to bring about improvement in the conceptual framework and strengthening of their neural networks and the pruning misconceptions of students in the subject of chemistry at secondary level and to evaluate whether the events of instruction are helpful to assimilate the stimulus material with the neural networks of the learners. It was also observed that the events of instruction significantly reduced the learning time and simultaneously the assimilation rate was also increased. Information bridging time was reduced to a significant level. Comparison was made between the students taught by <b>Gagne’s</b> events and the students taught by traditional method of instruction. The change or significant difference was observed in favor of those students who were treated by <b>Gagne’s</b> events of instruction. The study put emphasis on the incorporation of <b>Gagne’s</b> events of instruction while planning, designing and teaching phase of lesson plan. The events of instruction need to be employed in the planning and designing phase of teaching learning process. The teachers can improve their pedagogical content knowledge and can design the learning situations and learning environments that are conducive to learning. So the teaching learning process, teacher’s teaching skills can be made efficient and effective by incorporating <b>Gagne’s</b> events of instruction...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Developing skills in performing basic slit-lamp biomicroscopy {{is an important}} element of the ophthalmology undergraduate curriculum. As a doctor working in an ophthalmology department, I often provide slit-lamp teaching for medical students. This paper describes a lesson plan for this technique using <b>Gagne’s</b> nine events of instruction. The presented lesson plan is a combination of <b>Gagne’s</b> nine events of instruction and Peyton’s four-step approach. <b>Gagne’s</b> nine events of instruction correlate with and address the mental conditions of learning when adult learners are presented with various stimuli. Peyton’s four-step approach is a model for teaching practical skills that consists of demonstration, deconstruction, explanation, and performance. This article describes a slit-lamp biomicroscopy teaching session using <b>Gagne’s</b> nine events of instruction. Each step is carefully elaborated with relevant activities to suit learners with various learning styles. Peyton’s approach is used to teach the actual skill. This lesson plan is particularly relevant for tutors designing slit-lamp biomicroscopy teaching for undergraduate students, foundation doctors, general practitioners and emergency department staff. Ultimately, this lesson plan also serves as a model that is applicable for acquiring many other practical skills. The flexible adoption of <b>Gagne’s</b> nine events of instruction in combination with other teaching models helps in the planning of effective teaching sessions...|$|R

The theory has been applied to the design of instruction in all fields, though in its original formulation special attention was given to military training settings.|$|R
5|$|When the Kings {{returned}} Schenn to the WHL in December 2010, {{it allowed}} him {{to try out for}} Canada's team at the 2011 World Junior Hockey Championships. Schenn made the team after the December selection camp, and was selected as one of the alternate captains. In Canada's preliminary round game against the Czech Republic, Schenn was named player of the game. Against Norway, Schenn tied Canada's record for goals in a single game (held by Mario Lemieux and Simon <b>Gagne)</b> with four. He also added an assist to finish the game with five points. In Canada's gold medal loss to Russia, Schenn scored a goal and added an assist. He recorded 18 points in the tournament, tying Canada's all-time record for a single tournament, set by Dale McCourt in 1977. After the tournament, Schenn was the tournament's top scorer, and was named to the media All-Star team for the event. The IIHF Directorate named him Best Forward and Tournament MVP. Canada's coaching staff selected him as one of the team's top three players for the tournament. At the end of the tournament, it was revealed that Schenn had been playing with a separated shoulder he suffered during Canada's quarter-final victory against Switzerland.|$|E

40|$|The need {{to support}} {{bioinformatics}} training has been widely recognized by scientists, industry, and government institutions. However, the discussion of instructional methods for teaching bioinformatics is only beginning. Here we report on a systematic attempt to design two bioinformatics workshops for graduate biology students {{on the basis of}} <b>Gagne’s</b> Conditions of Learning instructional design theory. This theory, although first published in the early 1970 s, is still fundamental in instructional design and instructional technology. First, top-level as well as prerequisite learning objectives for a microarray analysis workshop and a primer design workshop were defined. Then a hierarchy of objectives for each workshop was created. Hands-on tutorials were designed to meet these objectives. Finally, events of learning proposed by <b>Gagne’s</b> theory were incorporated into the hands-on tutorials. The resultant manuals were tested on a small number of trainees, revised, and applied in 1 -day bioinformatics workshops. Based on this experience and on observations made during the workshops, we conclude that <b>Gagne’s</b> Conditions of Learning instructional design theory provides a useful framework for developing bioinformatics training, but may not be optimal as a method for teaching it...|$|R
