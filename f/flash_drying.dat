Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit.

Besides its economic importance, that application is representative of those where the product is combustible, so that the drying needs to be conducted in an inert atmosphere, which is achieved by recycling some of the drying gas.

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry {{was used}} to study the relationships among drying rate, desiccation sensitivity, and the properties of water in homeohydrous (recalcitrant) seeds of Landolphia kirkii. Slow drying of intact seeds to axis moisture contents of approximately 0. 9 to 0. 7 gram/gram caused lethal damage, whereas very rapid (<b>flash)</b> <b>drying</b> of excised embryonic axes permitted removal of water to approximately 0. 3 gram/gram. The amount of nonfreezable water in embryonic axes (0. 28 gram H 2 O/gram dry mass) did not change with drying rate and {{was similar to that}} of desiccation-tolerant seeds. These results suggest that the amount of nonfreezable water per se is not an important factor in desiccation sensitivity. However, <b>flash</b> <b>drying</b> that removed all freezable water damaged embryonic axes. Differences between desiccation-sensitive and -tolerant seeds occur at two levels: (a) tolerant seeds naturally lose freezable water, and sensitive seeds can lose this water without obvious damage only if it is removed very rapidly; (b) tolerant seeds can withstand the loss of a substantial proportion of nonfreezable water, whereas sensitive seeds are damaged if nonfreezable water is removed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIndustrially, {{after the}} {{crystallisation}} of lactose from mother liquor, the crystals {{are separated by}} centrifugation and then <b>dried</b> in a <b>flash</b> <b>drier</b> followed by a fluid bed drier. It is known that if the moisture content and/or particle size is not correct then lumping and caking of the lactose can occur in the <b>flash</b> <b>drier</b> causing operational problems. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the influence of water content and particle size distribution on the caking of lactose powders. Powders with different d 50 's and different water contents had their caking/clumping characteristics analyzed with a texture analyzer, a sticky plate and a blow tester to determine their cohesion. A theoretical approach looking at the capillary interactions of the liquid bridges between lactose crystals was taken from the literature to explain the results obtained. The results showed that lactose powder with a low d 50 can cake easily as soon as the water content is higher than 3 %. This cohesion between lactose crystals is due to liquid bridges linking them together. The number of bridges formed affects the level of cohesion: the more numerous they are, the more cohesive the lactose crystals are. Therefore, small particles cake more easily because the number of bridges in a given volume is higher than for bigger particles. It was predicted that the capillary force cannot hold together particles with d 50 bigger than 400 μm and that was confirmed by experiment. Finally, in order to prevent the caking of lactose powders obtained by processes such as a decanter centrifuge, the lactose crystallization step should be controlled to obtain large crystal (with d 50 > 300 μm) and/or the final water content should not be higher than 3 %...|$|R
30|$|Volume {{expansion}} of compacted coir pith discs {{was found to}} be significantly affected by the drying temperature. An optimum temperature of 140  °C was identified for the drying of coir pith by considering both volume expansion and drying time. Effective moisture diffusivity was found to increase from 1.18  ×  10 − 8 to 1.37  ×  10 − 8  m 2 /s with the increase of air velocity from 1.4 to 2.5  m/s respectively. Typically used mathematical models for thin layer drying with exponential functions were failed to describe the drying behavior of coir pith. However, Wang and Singh model and Linear model gave good correlations. A new mathematical model was proposed and it was found to have the best correlation as compared to the other mathematical models used in this study. Model constants for the proposed model were found to be quadratic functions of air velocity.

A pilot scale flash dryer was designed and fabricated to examine the effect of hot air temperature and velocity on the drying behavior of coir pith. Hot air drying was carried out to examine the drying kinetics by allowing the coir pith particles to fluidize and circulate inside the drying chamber. The physico-chemical properties of volume expansion ratio (VE), water retention capacity (WRC), bulk density, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of compressed coir pith discs were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the microstructures of dried coir pith. The results were compared with the two other drying techniques namely sun drying and oven drying. The effect of time duration for retting and the method of retting the coconut husk were also examined. The optimum temperature for coir pith drying was found to be 140 C. The most suitable range of particle size and the range of moisture content in dried coir pith were identified as 0. 5 – 6. 3 mm and 12 - 23 % (w/w, dry basis) respectively. The VE, WRC, pH and EC of coir pith dried in the flash dryer at the optimum temperature of 140 C was found to be 5. 01 ± 0. 21, 4. 02 ± 0. 10 (w/w), 5. 95 ± 0. 08 and 330 ± 16 μs/cm respectively. These values were comparable with those of the sundried coir pith. Oven drying caused rupturing the cells and case hardening of coir pith. Similar effect was observed with temperatures > 140 C for hot air drying and <b>flash</b> <b>drying.</b> VE and WRC of coco discs were found to increase significantly, pH to change marginally and EC to drop significantly with the increase of retting time.

Correlation analysis and residual plots were used to determine the adequacy of existing mathematical models for describing the drying behavior of coir pith using hot air.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} method to {{evaluate}} the potential for electric power production at any site of possible geothermal interest. Accounting for geological data of the reservoirs, the method allows the computation of the available electrical power of the investigated site. Electrical energy production from geothermal sources is realized through different techniques, such as single flash and double <b>flash,</b> <b>dry</b> steam, and binary ORC plants. The technique chosen {{to be the most}} productive is determined by analyzing a specific range of geofluid properties, mainly temperature and pressure. Moreover, each plant typology has a global efficiency that may be correlated to geofluid enthalpy by empiric relations available in literature. The proposed evaluation method brings together all these correlations, yielding the power availability from a geosource, once its temperature and pressure are known. The method takes as input the geofluid available flow rate, its pressure, temperature and non-condensable gas content. It defines the best plant option from these parameters, calculates its global efficiency and finally returns the actual available power. For sites of geothermic interest, such as the volcanic island of Ischia in Southern Italy, the results of the application of this new method clearly highlight the most suitable zones for power plants installations...|$|R

However, the seeds of many, particularly tropical, species are desiccation sensitive and are not amenable to storage under these conditions. Not only is long-term conservation of this germplasm difficult, but the characteristic of desiccation sensitivity also places limits on short-term storage of the seeds. This paper briefly reviews the physiology of these ‘non-orthodox’ seeds, and considers the progress {{that has been made}} in extending storage lifespan of the seeds, and in the cryopreservation of the germplasm. Short-to mediumterm storage lifespan of hydrated seeds can be extended by reducing temperatures as low as possible — where chilling sensitivity permits — although not below zero. Long-term cryopreservation of whole seeds is precluded because of ice crystal damage to the hydrated tissue, but a novel approach in dealing with this problem is described. Excised embryonic axes are <b>dried</b> very rapidly (<b>flash</b> <b>dried)</b> to water contents low enough to reduce ice crystal formation on freezing, but not so low as to introduce desiccation damage, and the partially dried axes are frozen very rapidly by plunging in sub-cooled liquid nitrogen (‘nitrogen slush’) to reduce potential ice crystal damage. Subsequent storage in liquid nitrogen affords the means for long-term conservation of the zygotic axes (and buds, apical meristems, callus or somatic embryos) and hence the genetic resources of species producing even the most recalcitrant of non-orthodox seeds...|$|R

More specifically, carotenoids such as astaxanthin, β-carotene, and lutein can be included as part of topical cosmetic products for protection against hyper-pigmentation or UV-induced damage (Wang et al. 2015; Mourelle et al. 2017). Similarly, polysaccharides from various green microalgae species can be included in cosmetic products for the purposes of antioxidant activity, gelling, or thickening (Mourelle et al. 2017). Due to the application of these products on the skin of consumers, consistent quality and controlled growth environments are necessary for the microalgae bioproduct precursors. The microalgae are grown in PBR with optimal light and nutrients which leads to consistent accumulation of the bioactive substances for skin care products.

Soymilk residue, also known as okara, was provided by a Brazilian soymilk factory. RSM showed that for a 120 second drying cycle, the lower the residue moisture contents (y) obtained, the higher the recirculation rates (x 1), regardless of the air drying temperature (x 2), and it could be expressed by the equation y = 7. 072 - 7. 92 x 1, with R² = 92, 92 %. It is possible to obtain okara with 10 % of moisture (dwb) under the condition x 1 = 1. 25, equivalent to RR = 61 %, with air drying temperatures ranging from 252 °C to 308 °C. The dried okara obtained through Central Compound Rotational Design (CCRD) presented a centesimal composition similar to the okara dried in a tray dryer, known as the original okara.

On slow drying, the α-helical contribution in both the 20 - and 25 -DAP embryo axes increased compared with that in the fresh control axes, and survival of desiccation was high. The protein profile in dry, mature axes resembled that after slow drying of the immature axes. Rapid drying resulted in an almost complete loss of membrane integrity in the 20 -DAP embryo axes and much less so in the 25 -DAP axes. After slow drying, low plasma membrane permeability ensued in both the 20 - and 25 -DAP axes.

In addition, the high surface area offered by nanoparticles allows binding of a large amount of urea molecules. The method reported here is simple and scalable, allowing the synthesis of a urea-modified hydroxyapatite nanohybrid as fertilizer having a ratio of urea to hydroxyapatite of 6 : 1 by weight. Specifically, a nanohybrid suspension was synthesized by in situ coating of hydroxyapatite with urea at the nanoscale. In addition to the stabilization imparted due to the high surface area to volume ratio of the nanoparticles, supplementary stabilization leading to high loading of urea was provided by <b>flash</b> <b>drying</b> the suspension to obtain a solid nanohybrid. This nanohybrid with a nitrogen weight of 40...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{identified}} {{a need to}} improve the management of wastewater resulting from high explosives (HE) research and development work at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). LANL`s current methods off managing HE-contaminated wastewater cannot ensure that discharged HE wastewater would consistently meet the Environmental Protection Agency`s (EPA`s) standards for wastewater discharge. The DOE needs to enhance He wastewater management to e able to meet both present and future regulatory standards for wastewater discharge. The DOE also proposes to incorporate major pollution prevention and waste reduction features into LANL`s existing HE production facilities. Currently, wastewater from HE processing buildings at four Technical Areas (TAs) accumulates in sumps where particulate HE settles out and barium is precipitated. Wastewater is then released from the sumps to the environment at 15 permitted outfalls without treatment. The released water may contain suspended and dissolved contaminants, such as HE and solvents. This Environmental Assessment (EA) analyzes two alternatives, the Proposed Action and the Alternative Action, that would meet the purpose and need for agency action. Both alternatives would treat all HE process wastewater using sand filters to remove HE particulates and activated carbon to adsorb organic solvents and dissolved HE. Under either alternative, LANL would burn solvents and <b>flash</b> <b>dried</b> HE particulates and spent carbon following well-established procedures. Burning would produce secondary waste that would be stored, treated, and disposed of at TA- 54, Area J.
