The other two runners were the French challenger Fijar Tango (Grand Prix de Paris) and Lapierre (Prix Jean Prat). Carson settled Shady Heights just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third place behind Kefaah and Fijar Tango before beginning to make progress on the inside in the last quarter mile. Meanwhile, Persian Heights launched a challenge on the outside but hung to the left, hampering Indian Skimmer before taking the lead a furlong out. Persian Heights crossed the line one and a half lengths in front of Shady Heights with Indian Skimmer a neck away in third. Indian Skimmer's jockey, Steve Cauthen lodged an objection to the winner and the racecourse stewards decided that the interference at the furlong marker had cost the mare second place. Under the rules of racing at the time Persian Heights was relegated to third (behind the horse who had suffered from the interference) and Shady Heights was awarded the victory.|$|E

The project PIPSI (PIlotage Propre des Systegravemes Industriels/industrial system clean piloting) financing by Rhone-Alps Region is carried out with the aim to contribute to this objective. The study presented in this article concerns the pollution transfer in a metal finishing treatment line in order to minimise the environmental impact obtained notably with the pollution balance. <b>Drag-out</b> and draining phenomena have been particularly studied. Results obtained showed that a 10 seconds of draining reduced <b>drag-out</b> from 65 to 85 % in terms of pieces design. Moreover, during the experiments, 5 <b>drag-out</b> levels were identified by medium values from 26 to 1700 ml m- 2. So that, either a piece can be associated to a level or knowing the piece <b>drag-out</b> level, it is possible to evaluate its medium <b>drag-out</b> value. Then the pollution balance will be obtained more easily...|$|E
40|$|New barrels for {{electroplating}} {{have been}} developed and manufacturers {{of some of these}} newer designs have claimed significant improvements in <b>drag-out</b> losses by their new barrels. Since water consumption and waste generation are directly tied to dragout rate from processing solutions, it is clear {{that there is a need}} to produce a method of evaluating such barrels, so that the user minimizes pollution. This study, funded by The Illinois Waste Management Research Center (WMRC) produced a benchmark test to compare <b>drag-out</b> rates of plating barrels. The study used this test to compare two size ranges of plating barrels, small and large. For small barrels (6 ??? x 12 ???), testing showed that a reduction in dragout rate, as high as 48 %, may be achieved. For large barrels (16 ??? x 36 ???), testing showed that a reduction as high as 44 % may be obtained. A survey was conducted to determine the relative durability of the barrels under study. The survey indicated that some of the barrels that produce lower levels of dragout (those using fine mesh) may unfortunately provide less service life, but other low dragout rate barrels offered service life that is similar to traditional barrels. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two related}} problems from liquid-film theory. Firstly, a steady-state flow of a liquid film down a pre-wetted plate is considered, {{in which there}} is a precursor film in front of the main film. Assuming the former to be thin, a full asymptotic description of the problem is developed and simple analytical estimates for the extent and depth of the precursor film's influence on the main film are provided. Secondly, the so-called <b>drag-out</b> problem is considered, where an inclined plate is withdrawn from a pool of liquid. Using a combination of numerical and asymptotic means, the parameter range where the classical Landau-Levich-Wilson solution is not unique is determined. © 2010 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
40|$|The internationally {{accepted}} Wolfson Heat Treatment Centre Engineering Group {{test was}} used to evaluate the cooling characteristics of the most popular commercial polymer quenchants: polyalkylene glycols, polyvinylpyrrolidones and polyacrylates. Prototype solutions containing poly(ethyloxazoline) were also examined. Each class of polymer was capable of providing a wide range of cooling rates depending on the product formulation, concentration, temperature, agitation, ageing and contamination. Cooling rates for synthetic quenchants were generally intermediate between those of water and oil. Control techniques, <b>drag-out</b> losses and response to quenching in terms of hardness and residual stress for a plain carbon steel, were also considered. A laboratory scale method for providing a controllable level of forced convection was developed. Test reproducibility was improved by positioning the preheated Wolfson probe 25 mm above the geometric centre of a 25 mm diameter orifice through which the quenchant was pumped at a velocity of 0. 5 m/s. On examination, all polymer quenchants were found to operate by the same fundamental mechanism associated with their viscosity and ability to form an insulating polymer-rich-film. The nature of this film, which formed at the vapour/liquid interface during boiling, was dependent on the polymer's solubility characteristics. High molecular weight polymers and high concentration solutions produced thicker, more stable insulating films. Agitation produced thinner more uniform films. Higher molecular weight polymers were more susceptible to degradation, and increased cooling rates, with usage. Polyvinylpyrrolidones can be cross-linked resulting in erratic performance, whilst the anionic character of polyacrylates can lead to control problems. Volatile contaminants tend to decrease the rate of cooling and salts to increase it. <b>Drag-out</b> increases upon raising the molecular weight of the polymer and its solution viscosity. Kinematic viscosity measurements are more effective than refractometer readings for concentration control, although a quench test is the most satisfactory process control method...|$|E
40|$|The {{axisymmetric}} flow of a thin {{liquid film}} is {{considered for the}} problem of a vertically rotating disk that is partially immersed in a liquid bath. A model for the fully three-dimensional free-boundary problem of the rotating disk, that drags a thin film out of the bath is set up. From this, a dimension-reduced extended lubrication approximation that includes the meniscus region is derived. This problem constitutes a generalization of the classic <b>drag-out</b> and drag-in problem {{to the case of}} axisymmetric flow. The resulting nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equation for the film profile is solved numerically using a finite element scheme. For a range of parameters steady states are found and compared to asymptotic solutions. Patterns of the film profile, as a function of immersion depth and angular velocity are discussed.

40|$|Deposition {{of bubbles}} {{on a wall}} {{withdrawn}} from a liquid bath is a phenomenon observed in many everyday situations—the foam lacing left behind in an emptied glass of beer, for instance. It is also of importance to the many industrial processes where uniformity of coating is desirable. We report work on an idealized version of this situation, the <b>drag-out</b> of a single bubble in Landau–Levich–Derjaguin flow. We find that a well-defined critical wall speed exists, separating the two regimes of bubble persistence at the meniscus and bubble deposition on the moving wall. Experiments show that this transition occurs at Ca[superscript ∗] ~ Bo[superscript 0. 73]. A similar result is obtained theoretically by balancing viscous stresses and gravity.
