5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be able to escape. This hope {{is not part of the}} present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E

25|$|Dukkha Nirodha (cessation of suffering): One cannot {{possibly}} {{adjust the}} whole world to one's taste in order to eliminate suffering and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> remain so forever. This would violate the chief principle of Change. Instead, one adjusts one's own mind through detachment so that the Change, of whatever nature, has no effect on one's peace of mind. Briefly stated, the third Noble Truth implies that elimination of the cause (craving) eliminates the result (suffering). This is implied by the scriptural quote by The Buddha, 'Whatever may result from a cause, shall be eliminated by the elimination of the cause'.|$|E

25|$|In 1837, Mihail Kogălniceanu {{published}} {{a book on the}} Roma people, in which he expressed the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> serve the abolitionists. During the 1840s, the intellectuals began a campaign aimed at convincing the slaveholders to free their slaves. The Wallachian Cezar Bolliac published in his Foaie pentru Minte, Inimă şi Literatură an appeal to intellectuals to support the cause of the abolitionist movement. From just a few voices advocating abolitionism in the 1830s, in the 1840s, it became a subject of great debate in Romanian society. The political power was in the hand of the conservative boyars, who were also owners of large numbers of slaves and as such disagreed to any reforms that might affect them.|$|E

The 1892 session at Allahabad concluded thus: '...We do not know when the tax will be reduced. So that there is every necessity for our repeating this prayer {{in the interests of the}} masses, and we earnestly <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> he granted before long'. A similar sort of protest was also issued at the Congress session at Ahmedabad.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{portions}} of Champollion's works were edited by Jacques and published posthumously. His Grammar and Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian {{had been left}} almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838. Before his death, he had told his brother [...] "Hold it carefully, I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be my calling card for posterity". It contained his entire theory and method, including classifications of signs and their decipherments, and also a grammar including how to write and conjugate nouns and verbs. But it was marred by the still tentative nature of many readings, and Champollion's conviction that the hieroglyphs could be read directly in Coptic, whereas in fact they represented a much older stage of the language which differs in many ways from Coptic.|$|E
500|$|In a {{dramatic}} debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women {{was more important}} than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, [...] "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be adopted in every State. I will be thankful in my soul if any body can get out of the terrible pit. [...] But I believe that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro." [...] Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Wong became {{interested}} in environmentalism through visiting a waste reprocessing centre in Hong Kong, and realising just how little was recycled. His works re-use or recycle materials obtained from rubbish tips. In 2010, Wong curated [...] "Memory of the Forest", a collection of animal sculptures by himself and 13 students made using discarded wood, which symbolises the animals' lost habitats. Wong contributed a similar [...] "Mega Musical Art Piece" [...] to the 2012 Hong Kong Cleanup campaign {{in the form of}} an octopus. Wong participated in a campaign of the Ocean Recovery Alliance in Hong Kong in April 2013, contributing Death by Amputation – a sculpture of a life-sized finned shark – to an exhibition in Stanley harbour in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> provoke thought on the source of food and the cruelty inflicted by humans on animals. In 2014, as part of an animal-themed exhibition with other artists, he unveiled Ball Ball, an imposing sculpture of his one-eyed cat again made of discarded wood.|$|E

He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, [...] "we all complete".|$|E

This possession led to Naruto being ridiculed frequently by the rest of Konoha; being associated with him was considered taboo. As a youth, Naruto makes jokes and plays pranks to attract attention. Desiring what he lacked in his early life, Naruto dreams of becoming a Hokage himself with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> bring him the villagers' recognition and respect.

These are his classmates who are also assigned [...] to Team 7: Sasuke Uchiha, with whom he has had a rivalry since they first met at the ninja academy, and Sakura Haruno.|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and we can only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> never happen again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", {{that because of the}} book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E
