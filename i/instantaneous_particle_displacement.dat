The DPIV system utilized two 600 -mj Nd:YAG lasers to generate a double-pulsed light sheet synchronized with the sound field and used to illuminate a portion of the oscillatory flow inside the tube. A high resolution (1320 x 1035 pixel), 8 -bit camera was used to capture double-exposed images of 2. 7 -micron hollow silicon dioxide tracer particles inside the tube. Classical spatial autocorrelation analysis techniques were used to ascertain the acoustic <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> and associated velocities for various sound field intensities and frequencies.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to study fluidization of a vertically vibrated, three-dimensional shallow granular layer. As the container acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean square <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> increase, gradually fluidizing the layer. For nearly elastic particles, or low shaking frequencies, or small layer depths, {{the end of the}} fluidization process is marked by an abrupt increase in the granular temperature and rms <b>particle</b> <b>displacement.</b> The layer is then fully fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations.

40|$|Finite Larmor radius (FLR) {{effects on}} non-diffusive {{transport}} in a prototypical zonal flow with drift waves are {{studied in the}} context of a simplified chaotic transport model. The model consists of a superposition of drift waves of the linearized Hasegawa-Mima equation and a zonal shear flow perpendicular to the density gradient. High frequency FLR effects are incorporated by gyroaveraging the ExB velocity. Transport in the direction of the density gradient is negligible and we therefore focus on transport parallel to the zonal flows. A prescribed asymmetry produces strongly asymmetric non- Gaussian PDFs of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements,</b> with Lévy flights in one direction but not the other. For zero Larmor radius, a transition is observed in the scaling of the second moment of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements.</b> However, FLR effects seem to eliminate this transition. The PDFs of trapping and flight events show clear evidence of algebraic scaling with decay exponents depending on the value of the Larmor radii. The shape and spatio-temporal self-similar anomalous scaling of the PDFs of <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> are reproduced accurately with a neutral, asymmetric effective fractional diffusion model.

40|$|Many {{arthropods}} possess filiform hair sensilla (termed trichobothria in arachnids), {{which are}} extremely sensitive detectors of medium <b>particle</b> <b>displacement.</b> Electrophysiological evidence in some taxa {{suggests that these}} sensilla can detect air <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> resulting from intraspecific communication signals. However, {{it has not yet}} been shown for any species that the air <b>particle</b> <b>displacements</b> detected by the filiform hairs are themselves perceived as a ?signal? (i. e. that individuals make behavioural decisions based upon the responses of these organs to the displays of conspecifics). We investigate the agonistic behaviour of the whip spider Phrynus marginemaculatus and the role of its trichobothria in receiving agonistic signals. Whip spiders have extremely elongated ?antenniform? first legs, which they vibrate close to their opponents during agonistic interactions, inducing air movements that excite their opponents' trichobothria. We find that ablation of the trichobothria causes significant increases in: (I) contest duration, and (II) the probability of contest escalation past aggressive displays to physical fighting. Therefore, in the absence of air movement-sensitive sensilla, contest assessment is impaired. This suggests that whip spiders exploit true air movement signals during agonistic interactions, and that these are received by the trichobothria. Furthermore, these results indicate that, in whip spiders, such signals help mitigate the cost of agonistic interaction. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An SU- 8 /PDMS {{microfluidic}} chip incorporating a monolithically integrated on-chip lens set for transport and manipulation of microparticles is developed. The components, including the on-chip lens set, the microfluidic channel, and the fiber grooves, are defined {{in a single}} layer of SU- 8 by one-step photolithography. The design of the on-chip lens set and the fabrication of the {{microfluidic chip}} are fully described. The influence of the beam-waist radius on the manipulation performance is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified for the first time. In the cross-type optofluidic architecture, the evaluation is performed by measuring the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> with different beam-waist radii under different fluid-flow rates. The on-chip lens set is designed to have a specific dimension to achieve the required beam-waist radius. It is revealed that the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> is counter-proportional to the beam-waist radius. An experiment is performed. The results show that the <b>particle</b> <b>displacement</b> is increased by reducing the beam-waist radius.

High Intensity Ultrasound (HIU) is a technique that uses the acoustic field produced by a transducer to induce thermal effects in soft tissue for therapeutic purposes like tissue ablation for cancer treatment, localized drug delivery, sonoporation, among others. The bioeffects induced in soft tissue by HIU, particularly close to solid (bone) interfaces, are not yet fully understood.
