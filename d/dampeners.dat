25|$|Advanced players {{improve their}} {{performance}} {{through a number}} of accoutrements. Vibration <b>dampeners</b> may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II {{significant}} uses included {{door and}} window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, matting, flooring and <b>dampeners</b> (antivibration mounts) for the automotive industry. The use of rubber in car tires (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed {{a significant amount}} of rubber. [...] Gloves (medical, household and industrial) and toy balloons were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make rubber bands and pencil erasers.|$|E

Thus performed:•The calculation of the stress-strain state of the <b>dampener</b> during deformation. •The fatigue curve of the tested <b>dampener.</b> •Total measure of the <b>dampener</b> damage during operation was determined. An example of the proposed method application indicating the ability to provide the required resources of rubber-metal <b>dampener</b> in operation in the seismic isolation spherical tanks system is determined...|$|R

The way of installation of the bench and the description of the basic components such as: the electric motor of P 71 М type with the maximal frequency of rotation 3 000 rev/min. and the axle of the car of ZIL- 131 are offered. The assumptions on the secondary use of <b>dampener</b> after the termination of its exploitation term, the reduction of costs on the new <b>dampener</b> purchase, carrying out of В- 790 <b>dampener</b> inspection, the qualitative estimation of after repairing conditions, the simplification of the work for the experts of the given structure are made...|$|R

50|$|Ships can be {{deliberately}} {{moved and}} rotated by a player {{as long as}} they are powered and have at least one gyroscope, thruster, and cockpit. To be able to move in any direction and then be able to stop effectively via inertia <b>dampeners,</b> thrusters must be placed on the structure facing up, down, forward, backward, left, and right. More gyroscopes on a ship will increase the ships ability to rotate in space, but in order for the inertial <b>dampeners</b> to be more effective, more thrusters must be added in each direction in which dampening is required.|$|E
50|$|Seldon seems {{unaware of}} Olivaw’s role in perpetuating brain fever and other <b>dampeners.</b> But Seldon would {{probably}} approve, considering his quarantining of the New Renaissance worlds when Seldon served as Imperial 1st Minister.|$|E
50|$|The 5000 series units, to be {{introduced}} from mid-2015, will have sound <b>dampeners</b> in-built. A rubber ring will be placed inside the wheel to reduce resonance as the wheel turns through a curve.|$|E
50|$|Triplex plunger pumps use three plungers, {{which reduces}} the {{pulsation}} of single reciprocating plunger pumps. Adding a pulsation <b>dampener</b> on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic {{relationship of the}} high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality plunger seals. Plunger pumps with {{a larger number of}} plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation <b>dampener.</b> The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.|$|R
50|$|Thermal or Blackout {{curtains}} use very tightly woven fabric, {{usually in}} multiple layers. They not only {{block out the}} light, but can also serve as an acoustic or thermal <b>dampener.</b>|$|R
50|$|To reduce severe {{vibration}} {{caused by}} the pumping process, these pumps incorporate both a suction and discharge pulsation <b>dampener.</b> These {{are connected to the}} inlet and outlet of the fluid end.|$|R

50|$|The {{journey is}} meant to take 60 years, as the ship can only {{maintain}} a velocity of 20% the speed of light. Such velocities were rendered meaningless after the technology of the Thistledown was improved to include inertial <b>dampeners,</b> allowing higher accelerations.|$|E

50|$|The studio {{building}} {{which is}} nicknamed 'Warehouse 13' {{was founded in}} an era which saw an increased popularity for the recording of independent musicians in Chicago. Robert Pretty and company designed the studio building to accommodate the unusual acts that would record there. The live room of the studio is very large, with space for bands to set up expanded drum sets, percussion sections, multiple guitar and bass amps, keyboards/synthesizers, and DIY-homemade instruments which are sometimes seen in the studio. One side of the live room wall is covered with custom made foil encrusted foam sound <b>dampeners</b> designed and shipped by an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. These foil sound <b>dampeners</b> were designed to both bounce sound waves across the room in a stereo pattern, and to absorb certain frequencies for noise control.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in July 1974, GMB {{introduced}} the 250-S engine {{as an option}} for the Opala 4100. It was slightly different from the version that would be launched two years later: it didn't have a vibration <b>dampener</b> and the cooling fan came from the standard 2500, with four blades instead of six.|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{effective}} equity model adapted for medium term {{and long term}} risk assessment. One of its specific aspects is to allow an asymetrical dampening of the equity risk (called the <b>dampener</b> effect) conditional to the cyclical level of equity prices and to enable accurate Value At Risk assessements for medium and long term horizons (1 year and beyond). For a set of selected equity indexes we compare its relevancy for the 1 -year 99. 5 % Value At Risk (VaR) assessment with the different releases of the Solvency II <b>dampener</b> equity models. In a second step we test its relevancy for VaR assessments beyond a 1 year investment horizon. We show in our analysis that this alternative model gives quite good results and outperforms widely the others tested. It appears particularly suitable for insurance companies and pension funds given their medium or long term asset management process...|$|R

50|$|The 2011 ZX-10R {{underwent}} {{major overhaul}} both mechanically and visually. Most notably, Kawasaki introduced their Sport Kawasaki Traction Control (S-KTRC) system as standard. It predicts when traction {{will be lost}} and adapts accordingly. Also new are an ABS option called Kawasaki Intelligent Braking System (KIBS), a completely new design, adjustable foot-pegs, larger throttle bodies, a horizontal rear suspension, lighter three-spoke wheels, Showa Big Piston Fork (BPF) front suspension, and an LCD panel dashboard. The 2012 model {{is identical to the}} 2011 with the only exception being the slightly different paint schemes offered. In 2013 the models went under another small revision where the colors offered changed again and the front <b>dampener</b> was replaced with an Ohlins electronic front steering <b>dampener.</b> In 2014 the only changes were different colors. In 2015 the only color offered was black, alongside a 30th anniversary edition (in EU, a green color is also offered).|$|R
50|$|Many designs take {{advantage}} of the maintenance-free state of constant readiness. For example, a hydraulic <b>dampener</b> protecting a structure from earthquake damage could be secured with a shear pin. During normal conditions the system would be completely rigid, but when acted upon by the force of an earthquake the shear pin would break and the hydraulic dampening system would operate.|$|R
