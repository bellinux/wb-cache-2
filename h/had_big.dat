5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Big Boo and Doggett's {{friendship}} continues to develop. Seeing that Doggett bears strong {{feelings of guilt}} relating to the six abortions that she has <b>had,</b> <b>Big</b> Boo makes reference to the book Freakonomics, which suggests that crime rates in the 1990s fell because of Roe v. Wade. Following Lorna Morello (played by Yael Stone) being relieved of her duty of driving the prison van, the role is given to Doggett. She comes into contact {{with one of the}} new correctional officers called Charlie Coates (played by James McMenamin). Coates is initially friendly towards Doggett. Despite relationships between prison staff and prisoners being forbidden, Coates kisses Doggett, against her will, after feeding some ducks. Following another outing, Coates gets in trouble with his boss Joe Caputo (played by Nick Sandow) for being late for count and is placed on probation. Doggett apologises for having caused him trouble, and he rapes her {{in the back of the}} prison van.|$|E

25|$|Only {{after the}} 1920s German {{inflation}} was over Großprofil cars could finally be ordered. In 1924, the first 16 multiple units and 8 normal passenger cars were delivered. Because they <b>had</b> <b>big</b> elliptical front windows, they were commonly called Tunneleulen ("tunnel owls"). The cars were 13.15 meters long and had 3 double sliding doors. This series was called BI.|$|E
25|$|In her teens, Addams <b>had</b> <b>big</b> dreams—to do {{something}} {{useful in the}} world. Long interested in the poor from her reading of Dickens and inspired by her mother's kindness to the Cedarville poor, she {{decided to become a}} doctor so that she could live and work among the poor. It was a vague idea, nurtured by literary fiction. She was a voracious reader.|$|E

25|$|Columbushaus was {{completed}} and opened in January 1933, {{the same month}} that the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) came to power. Hitler <b>had</b> <b>big</b> plans for Berlin, to transform it into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905–81). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz would have got off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded {{on the wrong side}} of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and Südbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and Südkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.|$|E
25|$|The Historical Section {{was busy}} on {{a history of}} the Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) in August 1914 but work was {{suspended}} on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as a full-time secretary. Experience of writing the history of the South African War, showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain C. T. Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events like the Great Retreat of 1914, when few were kept and that these <b>had</b> <b>big</b> gaps. Although the diaries would not show why events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology and that later they could be scrutinised to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{building}} of the arena in the Meadowlands was to potentially lure a National Hockey League team to New Jersey. Governor Byrne was a member of an ownership group that was looking to do so, and in 1978 businessman Arthur Imperatore purchased the Colorado Rockies of the NHL and announced that he would be moving the team out of McNichols Sports Arena in Denver and relocating them to New Jersey. The NHL initially rejected the move as the arena was yet to be completed and, unlike the situation when the Nets moved, there was no arena in New Jersey at that time that would fit NHL standards as even a temporary home. Imperatore sold the team to Houston Astros owner Dr. John McMullen in 1982. When the arena was completed McMullen, who was a native New Jerseyan like Imperatore, announced that he <b>had</b> <b>big</b> plans for the team, including the long-planned move, and in the off-season the Rockies moved operations to New Jersey, where they became known as the Devils. The first NHL game played at Byrne Arena pitted the Devils against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 5, 1982, and the game ended in a 3–3 tie. The next season, the NHL All-Star Game was hosted by the Devils at the arena.|$|E

500|$|Other Sooners also <b>had</b> <b>big</b> days against Iowa State. Paul Thompson went 16 of 27 for 195yards and two touchdowns, both to Malcolm Kelly. [...] Kelly had a {{total of}} four receptions for 50yards on the day while sophomore Manuel Johnson had four grabs for 48yards. Linebacker Rufus Alexander pulled down his first {{interception}} of the season in the third quarter. Iowa State's only offensive points came on a 31-yard touchdown pass late in the first quarter from Meyer to standout receiver Todd Blythe.|$|E
500|$|According to author Chris Nickson, [...] "Breakdown" [...] was an {{important}} component of Butterfly: [...] "'Breakdown' showed Mariah treading forcefully into territory that was new for her and making it her own; it had a melody that simmered under her vocal, and a groove that was irresistible." [...] When Carey began recording the album, she had slow and sultry ballads such as [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] and [...] "Butterfly," [...] but also <b>had</b> <b>big</b> R and hip-hop like [...] "Honey". For this reason, Carey recorded [...] "Breakdown" [...] in order to fill in the midsection of the album, and serve as the album's [...] "backbone." ...|$|E

She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she <b>had</b> <b>big</b> ears and that's all you could see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could let go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we <b>had</b> <b>big</b> rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E
500|$|Harald is {{described}} by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically [...] "larger than other men and stronger". He {{is said to have}} had light hair and beard, a long [...] "upper beard" [...] (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly <b>had</b> <b>big</b> hands and feet, and could measure five ells in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts. The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald [...] "six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men" [...] (according to Henry of Huntingdon) or [...] "six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men" [...] (according to Snorri Sturluson).|$|E
500|$|... "Picture to Burn" [...] was {{inspired}} by her high school boyfriend, now firefighter, Jordan Alford with whom Swift did not establish a formal romantic relationship. She was his classmate at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee and they went out before he dated classmate Chelsea who would later become his wife. [...] "'They dated in freshman year, but then after that, girl code, once you date an ex-boyfriend you're not friends anymore. Picture To Burn is about him. Because he's always <b>had</b> <b>big</b> old trucks and stuff,' Taylor Swift said. She was frequently frustrated by his narcissistic and cocky nature, and decided to write a song about how she felt at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music. It was co-written with Liz Rose on guitar, and given a comedic edge (an idea of Swift's). Swift found herself sitting, playing her guitar, and saying, [...] "I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!', a line that was ultimately developed into the song's chorus. Swift described it as brutally honest, ...|$|E
