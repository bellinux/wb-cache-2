25|$|A {{tricycle}} undercarriage was fitted, with the nosewheel retracting forwards. The single-wheel main legs retracted into coverless fairings in the wings, {{so that the}} sides of the wheels could be seen even when retracted. The wings themselves, unusually, had a different airfoil cross-section on the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> than the outer.|$|E
25|$|The adult takahē {{is mainly}} purple-blue in colour, with a greenish back and <b>inner</b> <b>wings.</b> It has a red frontal shield and red-based pink bill. The legs are pink. Sexes are similar, the females being {{slightly}} smaller, but young birds have mainly pale brown plumage. Immatures have a pinkish bill with a bluish cast. This is a noisy species {{with a loud}} clowp call. The contact call is easily confused {{with that of the}} weka (Gallirallus australis), but is generally more resonant and deeper.|$|E
25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and carburettor air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>wings,</b> while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.|$|E

The tail of the aircraft broke away from the fuselage and fell to the ground about [...] from the main wreckage.|$|R
25|$|Potez 63.11:Because {{the pilot}} {{needed to be}} seated above the observer, the {{fuselage}} was taller, which resulted in degraded top speed and manoeuvrability. As a result, the 63.11 proved very vulnerable, despite being protected with some armour and basic self-sealing coating over the fuel tanks. As a secondary light bomber capability {{was part of the}} requirements (though it was rarely if ever used), the fuselage accommodated a tiny bomb bay, carrying up to eight 10kg-class bombs. This bomb bay was replaced by an additional fuel tank on late examples. Additionally, two 50kg-class bombs could be carried on hardpoints under the <b>inner</b> <b>wings.</b> Frontal armament was originally one, then three MAC 1934s under the nose, and many 63.11s were equipped with the same additional guns in wing gondolas as the 631s.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille, which because of their near-monochrome colouring {{give the impression that}} the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. [...] The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption, while the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.|$|E
2500|$|The wing possessed great {{structural}} strength, provided {{plenty of}} room for fuel tanks and a heavy armament, while allowing the aircraft to be a steady gun platform. Each of the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> incorporated two fuel tanks; the [...] "main" [...] tanks, housed in a bay outboard and {{to the rear of the}} main undercarriage bays, had a capacity of 40 gallons; while the [...] "nose" [...] tanks, built into the wing leading edges, forward of the main spar, had a capacity of 37 gallons each. Also incorporated into the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> were inward-retracting landing gear with a wide track of 13ft 6¾ in.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} certification methodology {{was developed}} for composite structures to include the effects of impact damage. The methodology has the capability to determine the reliability of impact damaged structure at any prescribed load level and impact threat, which may be specified in terms of impact energy or C-scan damage area. In addition, the methodology can also calculate the allowable impact threat level at a given applied load and specified reliability. The developed damage tolerance certification methodology was demonstrated on the F/A- 18 <b>inner</b> <b>wing.</b> The results of the methodology demonstration showed that the F/A- 18 <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> has excellent damage tolerance capability...|$|R
50|$|The main {{wreckage}} {{consisting of}} the fuselage, right <b>inner</b> <b>wing,</b> and left <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> still with its engine attached, struck the ground inverted and was immediately consumed by fire. The bodies of the eight passengers were found in {{what remained of the}} cabin but were burned beyond recognition. The violent gyration of the fuselage threw the two pilots through the roof of the cockpit. Their bodies were found unburned 12 - 15 yd from the main wreckage. The tail of the aircraft broke away from the fuselage and fell to the ground about 220 yd from the main wreckage.|$|R
2500|$|The wing was of NACA 23018 {{section at}} the root, {{and was a}} five-piece, all-metal, {{twin-spar}} structure. The untapered centre section carried the inboard engines and main undercarriage, while {{the inner and outer}} sections were tapered on their leading and trailing edges, with the inner sections carrying the outboard engines. The ailerons were fitted with trim and balance tabs, and there were hydraulically operated split flaps in three sections {{on each side of the}} trailing edges of the centre section and <b>inner</b> <b>wings.</b> A [...] fuel capacity was given by eight bag tanks, one on either side of the fuselage in the centre section and three in both <b>inner</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Il-16 {{shared the}} same wing-mounted pair of [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 as the Il-10 and added a pair of [...] ShKAS machine guns in the outer wing panels. The rear gunner was given a [...] Berezin UB-20. A {{cassette}} of ten AG-2 aerial grenades was added to deter pursuing fighters. The bombload was originally intended to be , carried in two bomb bays in the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> or on underwing racks, with a [...] overload capacity, but the normal bombload was increased to 400kg and the overload to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Whirlwind {{was quite}} small, only {{slightly}} larger than the Hurricane but smaller in terms of frontal area. The landing gear was fully retractable and the entire aircraft was very [...] "clean" [...] with few openings or protuberances. Radiators were in the leading edge on the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> rather than below the engines. This careful attention to streamlining and two 885hp Peregrine engines powered it to over 360mph (580km/h), the same speed as the latest single-engine fighters. The aircraft had short range, under [...] combat radius, which made it marginal as an escort. The first deliveries of Peregrine engines did not reach Westland until January 1940.|$|E

50|$|One {{approach}} is to use differential drag. By increasing drag on the outer wing and reducing drag on the <b>inner</b> <b>wing,</b> a corrective moment {{can be applied to}} restore the aircraft attitude and correct the yaw.|$|R
50|$|Trainer {{variant of}} the Metal-Gipsy Moth. Rearranging of the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> bracing wires allowed for easier access to the front cockpit, a {{necessity}} for military pilots wearing parachutes. Two prototypes and 47 production aircraft were built.|$|R
2500|$|Yahweh-worship was famously aniconic, {{meaning that}} the god was not {{depicted}} by a statue or other image. This {{is not to say}} that he was not represented in some symbolic form, and early Israelite worship probably focused on standing stones, but according to the Biblical texts the temple in Jerusalem featured Yahweh's throne in the form of two cherubim, their <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> forming the seat and a box (the Ark of the Covenant) as a footstool, while the throne itself was empty. No satisfactory explanation of Israelite aniconism has been advanced, and a number of recent scholars have argued that Yahweh was in fact represented prior to the reforms of Hezekiah and Josiah late in the monarchic period: to quote one recent study, [...] "n early aniconism, de facto or otherwise, is purely a projection of the post-exilic imagination" [...] (MacDonald, 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Voyager's world flight takeoff {{took place}} on the longest runway at Edwards AFB at 8:01 am local time on December 14, 1986, with 3,500 of the world's press in attendance. As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they {{unexpectedly}} flew down and scraped against the runway, ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends. [...] (The pilot had wanted to gain enough speed that the <b>inner</b> <b>wings,</b> rather than the fragile outer wings, would lift the plane; in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity.) [...] The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7mi; 4.3km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just before take-off. The two damaged winglets remained attached to the wings by only a thin layer of carbon fiber and were removed by flying the Voyager in a slip, which introduced side-loading, tearing the winglets off completely. [...] Some of the carbon fiber skin was pulled off in the process, exposing the blue form core. Burt Rutan following with pilot Mike Melvill determined that Voyager was still within its performance specifications despite the damage and decided to allow the flight to continue. [...] During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics while the plane was heavy prevented routine changeovers, and they became very fatigued. Rutan reportedly stayed at the controls without relief for almost the first three days of the flight.|$|E
