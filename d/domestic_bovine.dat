40|$|The <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> Bos taurus {{is raised}} {{worldwide}} for meat and milk production, {{or even for}} field work. However the functional anatomy of its central nervous system has received limited attention {{and most of the}} reported data in textbooks and reviews are derived from single specimens or relatively old literature. Here we report information on the brain of Bos taurus obtained by sampling 158 individuals, 150 of which at local abattoirs and 8 in the dissecting room, these latter subsequently formalin-fixed. Using body weight and fresh brain weight we calculated the Encephalization Quotient (EQ), and Cerebellar Quotient (CQ). Formalin-fixed brains sampled in the necropsy room were used to calculate the absolute and relative weight of the major components of the brain. The data that we obtained indicate that the <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> Bos taurus possesses a large, convoluted brain, with a slightly lower weight than expected for an animal of its mass. Comparisons with other terrestrial and marine members of the order Cetartiodactyla suggested close similarity with other species with the same feeding adaptations, and with representative baleen whales. On the other hand differences with fish-hunting toothed whales suggest separate evolutionary pathways in brain evolution. Comparison with the other large domestic herbivore Equus caballus (belonging to the order Perissodactyla) indicates that Bos taurus underwent heavier selection of bodily traits, which is also possibly reflected in a comparatively lower EQ than in the horse. The data analyzed suggest that the brain of <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> is potentially interesting for comparative neuroscience studies and may represents an alternative model to investigate neurodegeneration processes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> {{animals are}} {{valuable}} resources to Filipinos {{because they are}} used as work animals and food source. Filipino farmers depend on water buffalos or carabaos for farm work. They consider the carabao as their beast of burden because it helps them till the lands. Cattle, like carabaos are also domesticated in the Philippines because they serve as important sources of meat and means of transport. Surely, Filipinos have a great need for domestic animals because they serve as sources of meat and milk and assist in agricultural-related activities. However, disaster struck the <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> animals in the Philippines when carabaos and cattle were decimated by dangerous contagions during the American Period. The death of {{thousands and thousands of}} carabaos and cattle due to foot-and-mouth disease, cattle plague, bovine anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia affected the livelihood of many Filipino farmers and the business of cattle importers and local cattle raisers. This paper examines the impact of the animal disease problem to the Filipino farmers’ economic livelihood. It will also analyse and explain how this agricultural menace affected the country’s cattle industry as well as the business interests of many cattle importers and cattle raisers in the Philippines...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the brain of fetal, newborn, and adult pigs raised for meat production. The fresh and formalin-fixed weights of the brain have been recorded and used, together with body weight, to calculate the Encephalization Quotient (EQ).

The results have been discussed together with analogue data obtained in other terrestrial Cetartiodactyla (including the <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine,</b> sheep, goat, and camel), domesticated Carnivora, Proboscidata, and Primates. Our study, based on a relatively large experimental series, corrects former observations present in the literature based on smaller samples, and emphasizes that the domestic pig has a small brain relative to its body size (EQ = 0. 38 for adults), possibly due to factors linked to the necessity of meat production and improved body weight.

The linear and spatial correlations between these attributes were also studied, to determine conditions that would allow increased agricultural productivity.

40|$|Researchers have {{attributed}} 15 {{percent of}} global methane releases to emissions of methane from enteric fermentation in animals (wild and <b>domestic).</b> <b>Bovines</b> contribute approximately two-thirds of this amount. Since methane {{is a potent}} greenhouse gas, this source frequently is a target for emission reductions. However, the existing literature overstates the importance of bovine methane as a greenhouse gas {{by as much as}} 800 percent. Estimates to date have focused solely on gas emissions, ignoring the biological and chemical cycling that removes carbon from the atmosphere. The analysis presented here demonstrates the importance of these cycles in assessing the overall greenhouse effect of biological methane sources such as rice production, termites, and bovine animals. Ignoring this cycling results in overemphasizing the role of developing countries' total contributions to climate change. In economic terms, the analysis shows that reducing CO 2 emissions from energy use in industrialized countries is more efficient than reducing net greenhouse methane from animal sources.

40|$|Weather – cold, wet, hot and windy – pervades life, {{material}} and social. So present and obvious as {{to provide a}} challenge for research, material though ephemeral too, weather breaks boundaries and refuses categorisation. While night becomes day, the cold season warms up over weeks and annual patterns are changing {{on a scale of}} years, practices in the face of weather transitions are themselves shifting. Based on ten months of fieldwork in the small village of Gau in the Pahari Indian Himalayas this thesis interrogates the saliencies and permeations of weather in people’s lives. It investigates how people intra-act (Barad 2007) with the weather, though practices, infrastructures and relationships with others. My approach argues for the validity of weather as a means by which to learn about socio-material lives. Pahari villagers live and act within the weather that moves around them. They are subject to, but also modify, their thermal environment. Through housing, clothing and tools such as the fire and the fan they affect the impact of the weather as it meets their bodies, but also daily patterns of movement are coloured by weather considerations. This work views weather in relation to health practices (such as refraining from working during the rain so as not to fall ill), for care of others (such as <b>domestic</b> <b>bovines),</b> for house-building and hospitable relationship-building among neighbours, for negotiation of landslide-fraught access roads to elsewhere and for understandings of pollution in the air. This focus on weather is intended to connect dots for people working on climate change, both within and beyond anthropology, and to contribute to discussions in areas including human-animal relations, health and illness and housing...|$|R

40|$|Zoologists {{classify}} the savannah buffalo {{under the}} Bovini Tribe. Osteologically, the skull {{differs from that}} of the water buffalo of Asia, inter alia, in that the vomer does not articulate with the palatine part of the osseus palate. This gross anatomical study gives a detailed description of all the bones of the skull, mandible and hyoid apparatus of the savannah buffalo Syncerus caffer caffer (Sparrman, 1779). These bones are similar in many respects to that of the <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine.</b> However, due to the robustness of the buffalo skull, many aspects pertaining to bones or parts of bones that are different or more pronounced, are of anatomical importance. The sum-total effect of all these features, gives the skull its typical macro-morphology that differentiates it clearly from the other genera in the Bovini Tribe. The more important characteristics that were found, are the following: 1. The skull of young animals retains basic embryonic reshaping potential till quite late in life. It {{can be seen as a}} remnant of Meckel's cartilage in the mandible as well as in prolonged remodelling in the regions of the orbit, dorsum of the nose, and most markedly, also in the lateral walls of the cranium. A subsequent temporary atypical fontanel can even leave an osseus scar in the temporal region. 2. Temporary canals, associated with the developing permanent premolars, appear in the maxilla and mandible. 3. A well defined biomechanical supporting pillar forms internally in the skull of the buffalo. It conveys pressure from the lingual side of the caudal molar alveoli, to the ipsilateral external lamina of the frontal bone in the region of the frontal fossa. 4. Apart from one small external segment, fusion of the perpendicular and basal plates of the ethmoid bone to the presphenoid bone, in the region of the orbital plate, makes ethmoid-related sutures the least visible sutures to see in all post-natal stages. 5. The retro-orbital position of the cornual process, and the presence of a nasoincisive suture, are some of the osteological features that are shared with the domestic goat. 6. Pneumatization of the nasal bone and dorsal concha may occur, as well as of the tympanic part of the temporal bone. 7. The detail of the sutures other than those of the ethmoid bone, may allow "fingerprint" identification of specific bones or complete skulls. Other applied aspects of the skull may be of importance to hunters and clinicians. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Anatomy and Physiologyunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|U suradnji Gradskog muzeja Bjelovar i Instituta za arheologiju u Zagrebu nastavljena su sustavna arheološka istraživanja srednjovjekovnoga nizinskoga gradišta Gradina u Gudovcu kraj Bjelovara. Život se na lokalitetu odvijao i u prapovijesti, a u srednjem vijeku je podignuto gradište. Nalazi iz dosadašnjih istraživanja upućuju na razdoblje kasnoga srednjeg vijeka, a luče se dvije faze: starija (15. st., kada je lokalitet imalo oblik dvojnoga gradišta) te mlađa (kada je došlo do zatrpavanja jarka, oblikovanja jednoga većega središnjeg uzvišenja i podizanja novih objekata). U istraživanjima 2004. g. pronađeni su drveni konstrukcijski i obrambeni elementi gradišta iz starije srednjovjekovne faze. Gudovac-Gradina is {{a medieval}} lowland hill-fort {{located in the}} {{northern}} part of the village of Gudovac, about 7 km south-west of Bjelovar. The hill-fort was built in a swampy area, ca 50 m west of Plavnica Stream. The central elevation (high ground) is fortified by a broad moat and a defensive wall which is best preserved on the northern side, and in a broader surrounding area an entire system of walls and moats can be discerned which served to defend the fortification and to communicate with a smaller hill-fort - Mala Gradina, ca 500 m away, that probably functioned as a guard-house (Fig. 1). Finds of moulds and tiles for luxurious tile stoves, the kind used to be produced at the Budapest royal court towards the end of the fifteenth century, were found in the hill-fort of Gudovac. Numerous important finds have been known since the beginning of the twentieth century as a result of amateur digging. Professional archaeological excavations brought to light a whole number of other representative examples of tiles, as well as fragments of ceramic vessels and glasses, majolica glasses and majolica decorative plates, which were imports in Gudovac. Furthermore, there are finds of stone projectiles, iron arrows, numerous ceramic pots, knives, animal bones, etc. As a rare item an Easter egg was found, decorated by waxing techniques. The excavations were conducted at the central elevation in the area towards the northern defensive wall (Fig. 2). In the upper layers traces of burning and holes from columns that used to support wooden structures were unearthed. A thick layer of leveling the surface was found, representing the border between the younger and older medieval horizon. Archaeological excavations show that the younger medieval intervention was undertaken in order to expand the surface of the central high ground and to cover the wide moat, which originally separated the central elevation from the smaller one in the north. Thus in the older medieval phase, according to its shape, the site used to be a so-called dual hill-fort. The conducted analysis of animal remains from the younger phase layers points to the use of small <b>domestic</b> <b>bovine</b> animals - ca 114 cm high (Bos taurus) for milk and food, as well as of domestic pigs (Sus domesticus), whereas the remains of wild animal species such as red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe (Capreolus capreolus) are few in number. Birds are also represented - hens (Gallus sp.), geese (Anser sp.), grouses (Tetrastes bonasia) and wild hens (Gallus gallus) as well as hares (Lepus europaeus). The shell specimens Anodanta cygnea, Unio sp. and Sphaerium rivicola enable an estimate of the water class rating. The newly discovered deep moat is not visible in the present soil configuration. Beneath the layers of leveling the moat, at ca 3 m, well-preserved remains of an imploded and demolished wooden structure - worked oak planks and beams, as well as round beech logs and stakes were found. The imploded structure or a room between the central and the additional northern elevations originally rested upon massive wooden pilots, i. e. on a bridge over a water-filled moat between the two elevated structures (Fig. 2). Beneath the layer of worked planks, beams - construction material - there was a layer rich with numerous pots for preserving and cooking food, as well as a layer rich with finds of other kitchen or pantry utensils: iron knives, dippers, pans, hen and goose eggs, a large number of animal bones, etc. In an extraordinarily humid medium fragments of clothing and footwear could be preserved, as well as numerous archaeobotanical finds. The bottom of the moat was reached at the depth of 3. 80 m of the present ground surface. A semicircular row of wooden beams was found near a slope of the central elevation. Beams beneath the bridge construction with the room were staked vertically. Beams still staked around the central high ground, that are not linked with the bridge construction, are staked diagonally (their bottom part being staked in the slope of the central elevation). It is presumed that their tops were also sharpened and that they served as an additional defensive element of the central high ground, at the same time reinforcing its slopes in construction terms (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Archaeological excavations have shown that the hill-fort of Gudovac in the Late Middle Ages was a fortified noblemen’s homestead, where along with the complex coexistence of noblemen and their servants, tile stoves were also manufactured. This site was settled since prehistoric times (a Neolithic layer was found), probably also in Classical Antiquity (individual finds within medieval layers) up to the Middle Ages. Finds from excavations conducted so far point to the Late Middle Ages, and two phases can be distinguished: an older one (fifteenth century, when the site had a shape of a dual hillfort) and a younger one (when the moat was covered up and leveled, a central high ground was remade and enlarged and new structures were built). Finds from the layers of moat leveling and those of the imploded room are typologically dated into the second half and the end of the fifteenth century. The result of the analysis of C 14 wood samples from the moat was 460 ± 65 BP, i. e. the calibration scope is AD 1400 - 1500 AD (with 64, 1 % probability). The result of the C 14 analysis of a burned beam from layer SU 5 (structure from the younger phase of the hill-fort) was 315 ± 80 BP (AD 1480 - 1650 AD, 68, 2 %), and of the sample of the sharpened diagonally staked beam from the slope of the central elevation from the older phase of the hill-fort 420 ± 65 BP (AD 1420 - 1520 AD; 55, 3 %). Such absolute dates confirm the dating of the finds and the existence of a younger and an older phase of the hill-fort, but of course as we mentioned the continuity of life at the site goes back to prehistory. Only a continuation of the excavations will answer the question of weather the original hill-fort was founded in the fifteenth century, or it was first reshaped and reconstructed in that period due to the needs of the time and the wishes of the propertyowners, only to be reconstructed second time later in the very end of the Late Middle Ages. Historical data point to the possibility of building the hill-fort at the beginning of the fourteenth century, as magister Gud (after which the village acquired its name) was mentioned. The culmination of the life in the hill-fort was in the second half of the fifteenth and at the very beginning of the sixteenth century during magister Petar who was viceprotonotarius regni Sclavoniae, vicarius temporalis episcopatus Zagrabiensis, vicarius in materialibus and was closely linked not only with the Church, but also with the royal court in Buda. Around 1543 the hill-fort changed its function from being a noblemen’s estate into being one in a series of fortifications that defended against the Ottomans. The decline of the hill-fort can be supposed to have occurred around the mid-sixteenth century, as it ceased being mentioned in historical sources, or somewhat later, as confirmed also by the C 14 dates...|$|E
40|$|In {{each month}} from July to December, grazing {{activity}} {{for each of}} 12 animals was recorded {{over a number of}} days continuously using vibrarecorders. The work was done at Killarney National Park and the animals were heifers of the Kerry breed living under semi-natural conditions with abundant pasture available. In July (16 hour day-length) - all animals began grazing at dawn and grazed for about 2. 5 hours. This first bout was followed at intervals of about 2 hours by shorter bouts each about one hour in duration. In late afternoon another bout commenced which continued for 4 to 5 hours through until after dusk. During darkness, about midnight, there was a short bout of grazing. All of the animals behaved thus and the pattern was repeated each day. Total grazing time was near 11 hours each day. By October day-length had decreased. There was still a bout at dawn and a bout at sunset. As in July there were three smaller bouts but all occurred during darkness. The total grazing time was close to 11 hours as before. The pattern of grazing was consistent between animals and days. In August-September-October and November there were always two major bouts of grazing related to dawn and dusk. Grazing total time was always near 11 hours. As day-length decreased the smaller daylight bouts were progressively replaced by bouts during darkness. Similar patterns were also found in studies of grazing Holstein/Friesian heifers and of housed non-lactating cows at Moorepark. The primary feature of the grazing pattern is the bout. The bout implies that there is a control that determines when grazing commences and ends. Rumen capacity plays a part but does not explain why minor bouts are only one hour and major bouts are more than 4 hours. The rigid association of the two major bouts with dawn and dusk implies that light also plays a part. That the total grazing time is constant suggests that yet another control is operating that is related to the state of the animal relative to a target state. And this control relates to a 24 -hour period. <b>Domestic</b> <b>bovines</b> do not display any patterns of behaviour related to seasonal or lunar cycles.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the United States in December 2003, U. S. beef exports have declined approximately 85 percent. A number of countries, including Japan and Korea (the top export markets for U. S. beef), have banned imports of beef from the United States, while U. S. exports to other important markets, such as Mexico and Canada, have been well below previous levels. Domestic demand in the United States was not significantly affected by the BSE discovery, but the effect of decreased beef exports on U. S. price is significant. This study examines the effect of exports and other supply and demand factors on U. S. meat prices, and estimates {{the effect of the}} drop in exports on U. S. beef and cattle prices. Results indicate that if all other factors remain the same, the drop in exports results in a $ 0. 22 per pound reduction in retail beef prices and a $ 0. 04 per pound reduction in the slaughter steer price.

40|$|One {{function}} of the gut microbiota gaining recent attention, especially in herbivorous mammals and insects, is the metabolism of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). We investigated whether this function exists within the gut communities of a specialist avian herbivore. We sequenced the cecal metagenome of the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), which specializes on chemically defended sagebrush (Artemisia spp.). We predicted that the cecal metagenome of the sage-grouse would be enriched in genes associated with the metabolism of PSMs {{when compared to the}} metagenome of the domestic chicken. We found that representation of microbial genes associated with ‘xenobiotic degradation and metabolism’ was 3 -fold higher in the sage-grouse cecal metagenomes when compared to that of the domestic chicken. Further, we identified a complete metabolic pathway for the degradation of phenol to pyruvate, which was not detected in the metagenomes of the <b>domestic</b> chicken, <b>bovine</b> rumen or 14 species of mammalian herbivores. Evidence of monoterpene degradation (a major class of PSMs in sagebrush) was less definitive, although we did detect genes for several enzymes associated with this process. Overall, our results suggest that the gut microbiota of specialist avian herbivores plays a similar role to the microbiota of mammalian and insect herbivores in degrading PSMs...|$|R

We investigated antibody titers from domestic swine against four bovine arboviruses (BEF, Akabane, Aino, and Chuzan virus) and from cattle against JEV in Korea. While the positive rates for Akabane and BEF were 37. 4 % and 15. 7 %, the positive incidence of Chuzan and Aino were relatively low, with positive rates of 3. 04 % and 0. 4 %, respectively, {{based on a}} virus neutralization assay. Antibody titers against more than one virus were also frequently detected in domestic swine. The incidence of JEV was 51. 3 % among domestic cattle. In addition, one positive case was detected in the thoracic fluids from 35 aborted calves, based on the hemagglutination inhibition test. Our results indicate that swine are susceptible hosts of bovine arboviruses without showing clinical symptoms in a natural environment. Moreover, we confirmed that JEV could be associated with reproductive failure in pregnant cattle, as were other vector-borne bovine arboviruses assessed in this study...|$|R

Among the critical regulatory factors that maintain the pluripotency and self-renewal of undifferentiated ESCs, NANOG plays a very important role. Nevertheless, because pluripotency maintaining factors and specific markers for livestock ESCs have not yet been probed, few studies of the NANOG gene from <b>domestic</b> animals including <b>bovine</b> have been reported. Therefore, we chose mouse ESCs in order to understand and compare NANOG expression between bovine, human, and mouse during ESCs differentiation. We cloned a 600 bp (− 420 /+ 181) bovine NANOG 5 ′-flanking region, and tagged it with humanized recombinant green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) as a tracing reporter. Very high GFP expression for bovine NANOG promoter was observed in the mouse ESC line. GFP expression was monitored upon ESC differentiation and was gradually reduced along with differentiation toward neurons and adipocyte cells. Activity of bovine NANOG (− 420 /+ 181) promoter was compared with already known mouse and human NANOG promoters in mouse ESC and they were likely to show a similar pattern of regulation. In conclusion, bovine NANOG 5 -flanking region functions in mouse ES cells and has characteristics similar to those of mouse and human. These results suggest that bovine gene function studied in mouse ES cells should be evaluated and extrapolated for application to characterization of bovine ES cells...|$|R

Methods and Findings: A miracidial hatching technique was used to investigate the prevalence of S. japonicum infections in domestic ruminants and field feces collected from two towns located to the south and east of Dongting Lake, Hunan province, between 2005 and 2010. The overall prevalence of infection was not significantly reduced from 4. 93 % in 2005 to 3. 64 % in 2008, after which it was maintained at this level. Bovines comprised 23. 5 – 58. 2 % of the total infected ruminants, while goats comprised 41. 8 – 76. 5 %. Infection rates in cattle and goats were significantly higher than those found in buffalo in most study years. The prevalence in buffalo younger than three years was significantly higher than that in those aged over three years. All the positive field samples of feces were derived from bovines in Nandashan. In Matang Town, 61. 22 % of the positive field feces were from bovines, while the rest were from goats. The positive rates for field feces were approximately the same in April and November/October.

Typically, PCR amplification of DNA from each panel cell line is followed by gel electrophoresis and scoring of each clone for {{the presence or absence of}} PCR product. To improve sensitivity and efficiency of radiation hybrid panel analysis in comparison to gel-based methods, we adapted fluorescence-based real-time PCR and dissociation curve analysis for use as a novel scoring method. Results As proof of principle for this dissociation curve method, we generated new maps of river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) chromosome 20 by both dissociation curve analysis and conventional marker scoring. We also obtained sequence data to augment dissociation curve results. Few genes have been previously mapped to buffalo chromosome 20, and sequence detail is limited, so 65 markers were screened from the orthologous chromosome of <b>domestic</b> cattle. Thirty <b>bovine</b> markers (46 %) were suitable as cross-species markers for dissociation curve analysis in the buffalo radiation hybrid panel under a standard protocol, compared to 25 markers suitable for conventional typing. Computational analysis placed 27 markers on a chromosome map generated by the new method, while the gel-based approach produced only 20 mapped markers. Among 19 markers common to both maps, the marker order on the map was maintained perfectly. Conclusion Dissociation curve analysis is reliable and efficient for radiation hybrid panel scoring, and is more sensitive and robust than conventional gel-based typing methods. Several markers could be scored only by the new method, and ambiguous scores were reduced. PCR-based dissociation curve analysis decreases both time and resources needed for construction of radiation hybrid panel marker maps and represents a significant improvement over gel-based methods in any species. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe discovery, at Sidon, of a {{group of}} burials dated to the Middle Bronze Age – most of which {{contained}} animal remains together with human burials – presents a new corpus of funerary offerings and animal sacrifices. The analysis of the animal remains was undertaken in the field {{at the time of the}} excavations at Sidon in July 2001. There is little in the way of archaeozoological data on the practices of burying animals and providing food offerings for the dead in the northern Levant and more generally in the Near East; in the southern Levant, however, a larger number of Middle Bronze Age sites have provided data on the animal remains found in burials. For a true understanding of burials and funerary rites it is essential that the animal remains are studied, in addition to and in parallel with the study of the other grave goods found in burials. Of the three types of burials found in the part of the necropolis of Sidon that has been excavated: simple inhumations, jar burials and burials in constructed graves, it is the last which are the richest in animal remains. Very few such remains accompanied the burials in the sand and the jar burials. Altogether, fifteen burials of the twenty excavated contained skeletal material, mainly of mammals, although some fishbones, some fragments of the plastrons of turtles and tortoises and a few shells that have not yet been positively identified were recovered. Among the species of mammals identified, only domestic animals are represented. Given the difficulty, in certain cases, of distinguishing the bones of sheep from those of goats, those remains that could not be precisely determined have been placed in the category 'ovi-caprines'. Also, the terms sheep(Ovis aries), goat (Capra hircus), cow (Bos taurus) and pig (Sus scrofa) are used generically to describe <b>domestic</b> ovines, caprines, <b>bovines</b> and suiforms. The ovi-caprines, that is the sheep and the goats, were found in quantity, whereas the bovines and the pigs were far less numerous. No wild species were found, except for one bone of a small carnivore, which can probably be attributed to a mustelid. Cutmarks were found on some of the bones. Some were burnt...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Mycobacterium bovis has a broad host range, {{and it is}} the {{principal}} agent responsible for tuberculosis (TB) in <b>bovine,</b> <b>domestic</b> and wild mammals. M. bovis also infects human, causing zoonotic TB through ingestion, inhalation and, less frequently by contact with mucous membranes and broken skin. Zoonotic TB was formerly an endemic disease, usually transmitted to man by consumption of raw cow's milk. It is indistinguishable clinically or pathologically from TB caused by M. tuberculosis. Objective: The aims of this study were, to isolate and identified M. bovis from raw milk samples by different methods, and evaluate the virulence of M. bovis in laboratory animals (Rabbit). Materials and methods: To conduct the study, ninety three cow's milk samples were collected from farms around Baghdad governorate. The decontamination of milk samples was firstly carried out, then samples were subjected to routine tests which include, direct smear for Ziehl Neelsen acid fast stain, culture, each sample was cultured on Lowenstein Jensen media with Sodium pyruvite (All cultures incubated on 37 °C for 4 – 10 weeks with continuous observation), and biochemical testes as Nitrate reduction test, Niacin paper strip test and pyrazinamidase test, were employed to diagnose and identified the bacteria. Beside molecular assay was used to confirm the identification of the isolates by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using specific primers for M. bovis. The virulence of these isolates were investigated through inoculate it in group of laboratory animals consist of 8 rabbit in addition to other group of 4 animals as control (inoculate with Phosphate Buffer Saline). The animals were scarified after 6 weeks of inoculation, post- mortem examination was carried out, smears were taken from lesions, and tissue samples were collected from lymph nodes and different organs. Results: The results revealed five isolates of M. bovis in direct smear by acid fast Ziehl-Neelsen stain, while eight isolates observed by culture, the colonies appeared with characteristic feature of cream color, rough, and with irregular edge. The molecular assay using PCR technique confirmed the diagnosis of eight positive isolates in smears and culture. The virulence of these isolates were investigated through the pathological effects appeared in inoculated rabbit which showed lesions scattered mainly in lymph nodes and different organs as lung, liver, spleen and kidney when compared with control group which were naive. Beside the infiltration of mononuclear cells in the internal organs particularly in the lungs. The result of histopathological examination clarified the virulence of M. bovis isolates, and its impact on tissue and organs of the rabbit. Conclusion: Our study conclude the presence of M. bovis isolates in milk in high percentage pause important source of tuberculosis infection for human being...|$|R
40|$|Since 2000 a {{multidisciplinary}} team of archaeologists, geologists and paleobotanists has been carrying out joint investigations at Ca’ Tron, a 11 km 2 estate {{located at the}} northern lagoon of Venice and included in the east countryside of the ancient Venetian-Roman Altinum. During the systematic survey conducted in Ca’ Tron estate nine Roman sites were identified, three of which were excavated in extension. Two rural settlements are analyzed in this paper, both attended since Ist to IV-V th century AD, having different planimetric features and economic role: {{the first one was}} a farm with several outbuildings, the second one was specialized in breeding sheep, with a large rectangular building, interpretable as a sheepfold on the basis of comparison with the Roman “bergeries” investigated in the Crau of Arles (Provence). Particularly relevant to the understanding of economic activities were the micromorphological analysis of soil types, chemical and biological, especially to clarify the functions of spaces and rooms, and the study of the archaeozoological finds. The results of chemical analyses support the archaeological interpretation of the remains of the two Roman rural sites, and suggest that some buildings were stables for bred cattle, showing that the site is particularly rich with P and organic matter of not-vegetable origin. Analyses of the Phosphorus, Carbon and Nitrogen content of the soil, together with Elemental Ratios, were applied. Two different methods (ignition and hydrolysis with perchloric acid) were used to determine the phosphorus content: their reliability is discussed. The faunal remains studied, though not very large in number, allow nevertheless to understand the management of farm animals and the economic system within the two rural complexes. Samples from both the two sites, A and M, share the almost exclusive presence of only the main <b>domestic</b> stock-raising species: <b>bovines,</b> caprovines and swine. Animals appears to have been exploited not only for meat, but also the cattle as power (in site A) and the caprovines (both sites) to obtain secondary products (milk and wool). Data analyzed suggest a differential exploitation of animal resources, apparently focused at rearing medium-sized animals (caprovines and swine) in the M settlement, whereas, in site A, bovines appeared important for the local economy as well. The research results allow the reconstruction of {{the eastern part of the}} Altinum ager complementary and integrated economy, which guaranteed the practice of all vital activities for the community: agriculture on the one hand, on the other breeding, particularly in sheep. The complex M Ca’ Tron attests to the practice of intensive and sedentary breeding of a delicate breed of sheep, which produced a sort of wool famous in anciente times for its softness; and this kind of breeding used independent housing facilities. It seems likely therefore that in the Venetia both types of farming were simultaneously present, sedentary and transhumant, according to race, a situation similar to the one documented for the Apulia et Calabria...|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in {{collaboration}} with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) has developed advanced rapid diagnostics that may be used within the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa) and the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). This effort has the potential to improve our nation's ability to discriminate between foreign animal diseases and those that are endemic using a single assay, thereby increasing our ability to protect animal populations of high economic importance in the United States. Under 2005 DHS funding we have developed multiplexed (MUX) nucleic-acid-based PCR assays that combine foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) detection with rule-out tests for two other foreign animal diseases Vesicular Exanthema of Swine (VESV) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) and four other <b>domestic</b> viral diseases <b>Bovine</b> Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV- 1 or Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitus IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Parapox virus complex (which includes Bovine Papular Stomatitis Virus BPSV, Orf of sheep, and Pseudocowpox). Under 2006 funding we have developed a Multiplexed PCR [MUX] porcine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for VESV and SVD foreign animal diseases in addition to one other domestic vesicular animal disease vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and one domestic animal disease of swine porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). We have also developed a MUX bovine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for the two bovine foreign animal diseases malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), rinderpest virus (RPV) and the domestic diseases vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitus virus (BHV- 1), bluetongue virus (BTV), and the Parapox viruses which are of two bovine types bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) and psuedocowpox (PCP). This document provides details of signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used. A condensed summary of the development, testing and performance of the multiplexed assay panel was presented in a 126 page separate document, entitled 'Development and Characterization of A Multiplexed RT-PCR Species Specific Assay for Bovine and one for Porcine Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Rule-Out'. This supplemental document provides additional details of large amount of data collected for signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used for all steps in the assay development and utilization processes. In contrast to last years effort, the development of the bovine and porcine panels is pending additional work to complete analytical characterization of FMDV, VESV, VSV, SVD, RPV and MCF. The signature screening process and final panel composition impacts this effort. The unique challenge presented this year was having strict predecessor limitations in completing characterization, where efforts at LLNL must preceed efforts at PIADC, such challenges were alleviated in the 2006 reporting by having characterization data from the interlaboratory comparison and at Plum Island under AgDDAP project. We will present an addendum at a later date with additional data on the characterization of the porcine and bovine multiplex assays when that data is available...|$|R
