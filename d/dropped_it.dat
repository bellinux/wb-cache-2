5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir <b>dropped,</b> <b>it</b> provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|California's win {{raised it}} {{to a final}} record of 8–6, while Virginia Tech's loss <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> to a final record of 8–5.

5|$|Inquiries {{were made}} through {{official}} channels {{about the prospect of}} Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then <b>dropped</b> <b>it,</b> possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E

Soderbergh took on the project but then <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> when he got involved with Out of Sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, but found {{that no one was}} certain of Jennings's role in the commission.

The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was <b>dropped.</b> <b>It</b> was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E

In that game, the Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Yellow Jackets, 24–14. Clemson also was selected to participate in a postseason bowl game. The Music City Bowl, played in Nashville, Tennessee, selected the Tigers to play against the Kentucky Wildcats. In that game, the Tigers defeated the Wildcats, 21–13.|$|E
