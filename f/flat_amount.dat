5000|$|Rural schools {{struggle}} with funding concerns. State funding sources often favor wealthier districts.

This favors wealthier districts {{with a much}} larger tax base. This, combined {{with the history of}} slow payment in the state, leaves rural districts searching for funds.

[...] These resources can enhance a student's learning opportunities, but may not be available to everyone if a district cannot afford to offer specific programs.

50|$|A valet {{is usually}} an {{employee}} of the establishment, or {{an employee of}} a third party valet service. When there is a fee, it is usually either a <b>flat</b> <b>amount</b> or a fee based on how long the car is parked. It is customary in the United States to tip the valet who actually parks the car. Valet parking is most often offered (and is most useful) in urban areas, where parking is scarce, though some upscale businesses offer valet parking as an optional service, even though self-parking may be readily available. For example, in wealthy suburban areas like California's Silicon Valley, some hospitals (like Stanford University Medical Center) offer valet parking for the convenience of patients and their visitors. On the other hand, where parking is not scarce, such as on the Las Vegas Strip, it is offered as a convenience to patrons. Some hospitals, like the Yale-affiliated Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut) on Connecticut's Golden Coast, have such limited space for parking that the emergency room is valet parking only, to fit as many cars in as possible.|$|E

This report analyzes four options to replace the current mortgage interest deduction with credits {{that are designed to}} improve incentives for homeownership.

Effective tax rates have dwindled because those taxes are not a constant percentage of price, but a <b>flat</b> <b>amount.</b> As prices rise, the relative importance of the taxes falls, unless Congress raises them. In fact, beer and wine taxes have been raised only once in the past 55 years, liquor taxes only twice. As a result, tax revenues that accounted for 12 percent of the sales of alcohol in 1980 now amount to only 7 percent of total sales. The result is a de facto subsidy on drinking and extra profits for alcohol manufacturers at the expense of taxpayers...|$|E
