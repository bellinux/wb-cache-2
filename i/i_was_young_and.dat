So, definitely, everyone can expect a good showing from me in Beijing." ...|$|E

He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency".

500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: {{there were times when}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males over the age of 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|Between 1991 and 1997, Colón {{attended}} the Jesuit Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, {{from which he}} graduated. Unsatisfied with his physical conditioning, he began attending a gym as an 11-year-old. Despite this, Colón has stated {{that he did not}} intend to become a wrestler at first and only did so for exercise. It was not until completing his college education that he decided to train, after noticing that his condition was on par with the wrestlers despite his age. However, despite this Colón initially expected to retire within ten years and run a private business. He admits that during this initial stage, he received peer pressure to match the accomplishments of his father. Colón's decision to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment was a controversial one among the Puerto Rican wrestling community. He was criticized by the locals, labeled as someone who had [...] "sold out" [...] his Puerto Rican wrestling traditions over for the [...] "flash and flair" [...] of the American company. Colón spoke of this in an interview with The Sun in which he stated [...] "I did not care about what they thought. I've always dreamed of working for the WWE when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> I took that chance when it came".|$|E
500|$|Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest {{daughter}} of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, {{they had three}} daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised that if I did not escape while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Smith, Sartorias-deles most resembles New Zealand. Smith's stories set in {{the world}} of Sartorias-deles have [...] "focuse a {{generation}} of kids with remarkable abilities who are born into extraordinary times." [...] Meliara ("Mel") is the protagonist of Crown Duel, which is {{set in the}} fictional country of Remalna. Remalna's human population lives alongside the mysterious Hill Folk, sentient beings that reside in the land's forests and with whom Mel has a special affinity. [...] Smith wrote the first part as a twenty-year-old, and sought to keep it set in Mel's teenage point of view when typing it out as someone older than forty. Smith describes the stories' primary audience as [...] "middle grade or YA, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> writing from the kid's eye view." [...] At the same time, she made some changes to the original story based on her experience, such as providing motivations for the adult characters and [...] "nail down place and time more thoroughly than I did." [...] When Smith learned as a teenager that [...] "anyone could write a book," [...] she tried to write stories that would please potential publishers, as she assumed that they would never approve of [...] "real stuff" [...] like Crown Duel. Several decades before Crown Duels release, Smith [...] "began the laborious process of consolidating" [...] her notes on Sartorias-deles. As part of her development of the novel, she drew inspiration from European history; for example, details like the novel's fan language and changing fashions were inspired by the fashions at the Palace of Versailles court of Louis XIV of France.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E minor, with Scherzinger's vocal range spanning from low-note of E3 to the high-note of G5. Lyrically, the song is centered around {{the desire to be}} famous when one grows up. Using satirical and autobiographical lines, Scherzinger begins the song's first verse with: [...] "Now I've got a confession / When I was young I wanted attention". The [...] "repetitive and catchy chorus" [...] follows, where she sings the lines: [...] "When I grow up / I wanna be famous / I wanna be a star / I wanna be in movies". MTV News commented that the song contains a theme that is [...] "getting plenty of traction these days – beware the high cost of fame." [...] Meanwhile, group member Melody Thornton said of the song's concept: [...] "If you strive for higher and bigger things – along with that – comes hard work and dealing with a lot of stuff that you'd never assume you'd have to. So yeah, while the song is meant to be playful, it still does have that little warning twist to it". Bill Lamb from About.com named [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] a possible answer song to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls" [...] (2006). Music critics were initially confused by the line [...] "I wanna have groupies" [...] in the chorus; mistaking the line as saying [...] "I wanna have boobies". American comedian Ellen DeGeneres also pointed this out when they performed the song on her talk show on September 23, 2008. Nicole Scherzinger said that [...] "All of us started with a dream...I know when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> I would sign people's notebooks, I wrote, 'Remember me when I'm famous,' and I don't know of a little kid who hasn't aspired to be someone" ...|$|E

[...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and I would think, 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It {{took me a long time}} to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E

Peniston said [...] "At that time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadn't learned how to balance everything just yet. It really hurts me that I made you feel like that." [...] Monica thanked her for the apology, and for caring [...] "after all the years have passed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{most infamous}} {{scene in the}} movie occurs when a gang member, without hesitation, shoots and kills a little girl {{standing}} near an ice-cream truck. The MPAA, headed by Richard Heffner at the time, threatened to give the film an X rating if the scene was not cut. Following {{the advice of his}} distributor, Carpenter gave the appearance of complying by cutting the scene from the copy he gave to the MPAA, but he distributed the film with the [...] "ice cream truck" [...] scene intact, a common practice among low-budget films. Carpenter regrets shooting the ice cream scene in such an explicit fashion: [...] "…it was pretty horrible at the time … I don’t think I’d do it again but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> stupid." ...|$|E

He also compared Nelly Furtado's vocals on the hook to Janet Jackson, saying [...] "nobody can really sing in that cadence." [...] On June 13, 2011, Game revealed he did a song with rapper Lupe Fiasco titled [...] "Skate On".

2500|$|For {{the period}} {{following}} his 1994 conviction {{and until the}} late 1990s, Vikernes formerly labelled himself as a follower of Nazism. In 2008, religious studies scholar Egil Asprem characterised Vikernes as [...] "an idol for skinheads with an inclination towards Paganism and for contemporary Pagans with an inclination towards National Socialism". In 2000, Jewish author Jeffrey Kaplan described Vikernes as [...] "busy promoting his Odinist and National Socialist philosophy from behind bars". According to Goodrick-Clarke, [...] "while in jail, Vikernes began to formulate his heathen ideology using material from Norse mythology combined with occult National Socialism". Goodrick-Clarke bases this account of Vikernes' beliefs on some articles that Vikernes had written for the short-lived magazine Filosofem. Goodrick-Clarke also uses the book Lords of Chaos, and a manifesto called Vargsmål ("Varg's Speech"), which Vikernes began to write after his imprisonment. Vikernes has denounced the English translation of his book in an article on his website. He has also stated on the website that [...] "Vargsmål was written in anger, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> in isolation, and the book is marked by this".|$|E
