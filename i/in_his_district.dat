5|$|Brown was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1866. His {{seat was}} {{declared}} vacant, however, {{because of his}} alleged disloyalty during the war. Voters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district</b> refused to elect anyone else to fill the vacancy, and Governor John W. Stevenson filed an official protest of the House's action, but the seat remained unfilled throughout the Fortieth Congress.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district,</b> as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11 attacks, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee had {{oversight}} of airport security and some elements of the United States' War in Afghanistan. Lynch sat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his first term.

5|$|Kennedy {{was sworn}} into the 113th U.S. Congress on January 3, 2013, and was {{assigned}} to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He praised the technology committee assignment as an opportunity to secure federal funding, including National Science Foundation and Small Business Innovation Research grants, for life sciences companies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district.</b> As a freshman in his party, he was unable to secure a seat on the Education Committee which he had sought.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} he took office, the FBI raided his office and homes for {{allegedly}} extorting money from small business owners <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district.</b> Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned {{in the face of}} extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pleaded guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64months in federal prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} of the Forty-second Congress convened on March 4, 1871. During his first term, Parker helped to secure {{pensions}} for veterans <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district</b> and campaigned for a new federal building {{to be built in}} St. Joseph. He sponsored a failed bill designed to enfranchise women and allow them to hold public office in United States territories. He also sponsored legislation to organize the Indian Territory under a territorial government.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district.</b> His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E

5|$|Military rule {{ended in}} 1983, and the radical Raúl Alfonsín was elected president. Menem ran for {{governor}} again, and was elected by a clear margin. The province benefited from tax regulations established by the military, which allowed increased industrial growth. His party got control of the provincial legislature, and he was re-elected in 1987 with 63% of the vote. The PJ was divided in two factions, the conservatives that still supported the political doctrines of Juan and Isabel Perón, and those who proposed a renovation of the party. The internal disputes ceased in 1987. Menem, with his prominent victory <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district,</b> {{was one of the}} leading figures of the party, and disputed its leadership.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{actively}} campaigned <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district</b> {{on behalf}} of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he lost New Hampshire. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|With {{only the}} two years {{remaining}} in former senator Bryan's term to distinguish himself before a re-election bid, Goebel took aim at a large and popular target: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A proposal from pro-railroad legislators in the Kentucky House of Representatives to abolish Kentucky's Railroad Commission was passed {{and sent to the}} Senate. Senator Cassius M. Clay responded by proposing a committee to investigate lobbying by the railroad industry. Goebel served on the committee, which uncovered significant violations by the railroad lobby. Goebel also helped defeat the bill to abolish the Railroad Commission in the Senate. These actions made him a hero <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district.</b> He ran for a full term as senator unopposed in 1889, and won another term in 1893 by a three-to-one margin over his Republican opponent.|$|E

5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>district,</b> joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E
