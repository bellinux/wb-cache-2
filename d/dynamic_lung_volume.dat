40|$|The {{pattern of}} stimulated {{breathing}} during carbon dioxide inhalation was studied {{in a group}} of 21 patients with severe irreversible airways obstruction (mean FEV 1 = 0. 9 litre, mean FEV 1 /FVC% = 50 %). Carbon dioxide rebreathing experiments were performed, the ventilatory response being defined in terms of total ventilation (V) and CO 2 sensitivity (S). Breathing pattern was defined by the changes in tidal volume (delta VT) and respiratory frequency (delta f) and the maximum VT achieved (VTmax). Contrary to some previous studied no significant relationship could be demonstrated between the severity of airway obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC%, Raw) and the ventilatory response to rebreathing (V, S, delta VT, delta f, VTmax). However, measurements of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (FEV 1, FVC, IC) were found to be significantly correlated with the breathing pattern variables (delta VT, delta f, VTmax). Resting PaO 2 and PaCO 2 were significantly correlated with delta VT but not delta f. Results indicate that the degree of airway obstruction does not dictate the ventilatory or breathing pattern response to carbon dioxide induced hyperpnoea. In contrast it is the restriction of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume,</b> by limiting the VT response, that appears to determine the ventilatory and breathing pattern response in patients with severe airway obstruction...|$|E

40|$|Lung {{function}} {{depends on}} the expansion and contraction of lung tissue during the respiratory cycle. The measurement of regional pulmonary function is of great interest and importance since many lung diseases can cause changes in biomechanical or material properties. It is also significant to study the radiation-induced changes in pulmonary function following radiation therapy. In this thesis, we propose a technique that uses four-dimensional (3 D+time) CT imaging (4 DCT), 3 D non-rigid image registration to estimate regional lung function. Lung images reconstructed at different inflation levels are analyzed for dynamic lung function development during a breath cycle. We demonstrate local pulmonary function can be reproducibly measured using 4 DCT in human subjects prior to RT. The image registration accuracy is validated using semi-automatic anatomic landmark picking system. The major contributions of this thesis include: 1) demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility of regional pulmonary function measurement using 4 DCT in both sheep and human subjects, 2) developing approaches to improve the measurement reproducibility by <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> matching and Jacobian normalization, 3) development and comparison four cubic metrics for reproducibility analysis, 4) research on time-varying lung ventilation in different breathing phases in both sheep and human subjects.

DESIGN: Follow-up cohort study. SETTING: University hospital pulmonary division and level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Sixteen survivors of severe ARDS (from 1992 to 1994) with a lung injury score > or = 2. 5. MEASUREMENTS: The follow-up study (from 1995 to 1996) included interview, physical examination, chest radiographs, static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> diffusion {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), blood gas analysis, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: The mean +/- SD interval between hospital discharge and functional assessment was 29. 5 +/- 8. 7 months (range, 15. 0 to 40. 7 months). In approximately {{one half of the}} patients, mild abnormalities in static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> were found.

The atmospheres were helium-oxygen mixtures with partial pressures of oxygen of 40 - 60 kPa. The durations of the dives were 14 - 30 days. Mean rate of decompression was 10. 5 - 13. 5 kPa/hour. A total of 43 divers were examined, six of whom took part in two dives, the others in one only. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> did not change significantly but total lung capacity (TLC) increased significantly by 4. 3 % and residual volume (RV) by 14. 8 % (p less than 0. 05).

40|$|We have {{measured}} lung {{mass and}} trachea dimensions in 46 giraffes of both genders ranging in body mass from 147 kg to 1441 kg, calculated static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> and developed allometric equations that relate changes in them to growth. We found that relative lung mass is 0. 6 ± 0. 2 % of body mass which is {{significantly less than}} it is in other mammals (1. 1 ± 0. 1 %). Total <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> is significantly smaller (46. 2 ± 5. 9 mL kg− 1) than in similar sized mammals (75. 0 ± 2. 1 mL kg− 1). The lung volume:body mass ratio decreases during growth rather than increase as it does in other mammals. Tracheal diameter is significantly narrower than in similar sized mammals but dead space volume (2. 9 ± 0. 5 mL kg− 1) is larger than in similar sized mammals (2. 4 ± 0. 1 mL kg− 1). Our calculations suggest that tidal volume (10. 5 ± 0. 2 mL kg− 1) is increased compared to that in other mammals(10. 0 ± 0. 2 mL kg− 1) so that the dead space:tidal volume ratio is the same as in other mammals. Calculated Functional Residual Capacity is smaller than predicted (53. 4 ± 3. 5 vs 33. 7 ± 0. 6 mL kg− 1) as is Expiratory Reserve Volume (47. 4 ± 2. 6 vs 27. 2 ± 1. 0 mL kg− 1, but Residual Volume (6. 0 ± 0. 4 mL kg− 1) is the same as in other similar sized mammals (6. 0 ± 0. 9 mL kg− 1. Our calculations suggest that Inspiratory Reserve Volume is significantly reduced in size (11. 6 ± 1. 6 vs 3. 8 ± 2. 4 mL kg− 1), and, if so, the capacity to increase tidal volume is limited.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the changes in exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) after exposure to normobaric hyperoxia (NBO), 100 % oxygen (O 2) at 1 atmosphere absolute (atm abs) for 90 minutes, are associated with changes in lung function. Methods: Eighteen healthy non-smoking subjects were exposed to NBO breathing 100 % oxygen and to breathing ambient air, both for 90 minutes on separate days and in random order. <b>Dynamic</b> and static <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> maximal expiratory flow rates, distribution of ventilation including closing volume and slope of phase III of the nitrogen washout curve (Δ N 2), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and FENO were measured before and after the exposures. Results: The mean reduction in FENO was 20 % (SD= 20) after the NBO exposure (p< 0. 001). Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> maximal expiratory flow rates, DLCO and distribution of ventilation were unchanged. No association was found between the changes in the lung function variables and the change in FENO. Discussion: Unchanged indices of distribution of ventilation and maximal expiratory flow rates indicate no small airways’ dysfunction, and unchanged DLCO suggests preserved gas transfer in the lung despite a significant reduction in FENO. FENO might be an index of oxygen exposure, but further studies over a wide range of oxygen exposures are necessary to establish the role of FENO as a marker of pulmonary oxygen toxicity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Breath-hold divers employ {{glossopharyngeal}} insufflation (GI) {{in order}} to prevent the lungs from compressing at great depth and to increase intrapulmonary oxygen stores, thus increasing breath-hold time. The presented case study shows the physiological data and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) findings of acute hyperinflation, deliberately induced by GI, in a breath-hold diver and discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the associated hazards of this unique competitive sport. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and expiratory flows were within the normal range, with vital capacity and peak expiratory flow being higher than the predicted values. Airway resistance and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were normal. Static compliance was normal and increased five-fold with hyperinflation. dMRI revealed a preserved shape of the thorax and diaphragm with hyperinflation. A herniation of the lung beneath the sternum and enlargement of the costodiaphragmatic angle were additional findings during the GI manoeuvre. After expiration, complete resolution to baseline was demonstrated. Hyperinflation can be physiological and even protective under abnormal physical conditions in the sense of acute adaptation to deep breath-hold diving. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging is adequate for visualisation of the sequence of the glossopharyngeal insufflation manoeuvre and the complete reversibility of deliberate hyperinflation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although airway obstruction, {{as defined}} by {{improvement}} of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and/or forced vital capacity (FVC), is irreversible in patients with COPD, they clearly seem to benefit from treatment with inhaled bronchodilators. AIMS: To assess the response pattern of residual volume (RV) compared to FEV 1 after bronchodilation in patients with reversible and irreversible airway obstruction. METHODS: Changes in static <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> were compared with improvement in <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> in 396 consecutive patients undergoing reversibility testing with repeat bodyplethysmography. Reversibility was defined as improvement of FEV 1 < 200 ml and < 12 % after inhalation of fenoterol hydrobromide. RESULTS: Irreversibility was found in 297 out of 396 patients with airway obstruction. Except for total lung capacity (TLC), all parameters (residual volume [RV], vital capacity [VC], forced inspiratory vital capacity [IVC], forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1] and the FEV 1 /VC ratio) showed statistically significant changes after bronchodilation in 396 patients. The multiple linear regression model adjusted for age, sex and BMI showed a non-linear relationship between DeltaFEV 1 or DeltaVC compared to DeltaRV after bronchodilation. If the increase in DeltaFEV 1 is lower than 0. 1 L, DeltaRV remains constant. However, if the increase in DeltaFEV 1 is more than 0. 1 L, DeltaRV decreases too. The same is found at an increase in VC of 0. 3 L. CONCLUSION: In summary, in patients with irreversible airway obstruction DeltaRV cannot be predicted by DeltaFEV 1 or DeltaVC after bronchodilation. Therefore, spirometric assessment should be complemented by bodyplethysmography...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{activity}} and health status deteriorate {{early in the}} course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This can only partially be explained by the degree of airflow limitation. Changes in (resting and <b>dynamic)</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> are known to be associated with functional impairments and thus might influence physical activity level. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to explore the contribution of dynamic hyperinflation during daily life activities (ADL) in the decline in physical activity. METHODS: Airflow limitation and inspiratory capacity at rest to total lung capacity ratio (IC/TLC) as a measure of resting hyperinflation were measured in 59 patients with COPD (GOLD I-IV). Mean daily physical activity was assessed with a tri-axial accelerometer. Measurements of dynamic hyperinflation during ADL (DeltaIC and inspiratory reserve volume at end ADL) were performed at patients' home using a portable breath-by-breath system. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that resting as well as ADL-induced dynamic hyperinflation independently contributed to decreased daily physical activity, together explaining 45. 8 % of the variance in physical activity. In contrast to hyperinflation, the severity of airflow limitation (FEV 1) appeared to have no unique part in explaining how physically (in-) active patients were. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of resting hyperinflation and occurrence of dynamic hyperinflation during ADL contribute to reduced physical activity levels in patients with COPD, independently of the degree of airflow limitation...|$|R

Static <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and flows, transfer factor for carbon monoxide (T 1 CO), transfer volume per unit alveolar volume (KCO), delta-N 2, and closing volume (CV) were measured and compared with reference values from recent Scandinavian studies, British submariners, and the European Community for Coal and Steel (ECCS) recommended reference values. Diving exposure was assessed as years of diving experience, total number of days in saturation and depth, and {{as the product of}} days in saturation and mean depth. Divers had significantly lower values for forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1), FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, FEF 25 - 75 %, FEF 75 - 85 %, FEF 50 %, FEF 75 %, T 1 CO, and KCO compared with the controls and a significantly higher CV. There was a positive correlation between diving exposure and CV, whereas the other variables had negative correlations with diving exposure. Values for the control group were not different from the predictive values of Scandinavian reference studies or British submariners, although the ECCS standard predicted significantly lower values for the lung function variables both in divers and the control group. The pattern of the differences in lung function variables between the divers and controls is consistent with small airways dysfunction and with the transient changes in lung function found immediately after a single saturation dive. The association between reduced pulmonary function and previous diving exposure further indicates the presence of cumulative long term effects of diving on pulmonary function...|$|R

Levels of eNO in PiZZ patients were also {{compared with those of}} subjects, without AAT deficiency (PiMM), matched for diagnosis, sex, age, smoking habit and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1). In AAT deficiency subjects airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine (PD 20 FEV 1) was also assessed. plFENOwas significantly lower in the PiZZ group (4 · 5 ± 1 · 4 ppb) than in matched PiMM subjects (8 · 2 ± 3 · 8 ppb), in healthy controls (9 · 3 ± 2 · 8 ppb) and in patients of other phenotypes. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and DLCOwere significantly lower in PiZZ than in other AAT-deficient patients. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness was not different among AAT phenotypes. These results suggest that eNO may be significantly reduced in PiZZ as compared to healthy control subjects and to AAT subjects with other phenotypes, independent of the level of airway obstruction. Whether, at least potentially, eNO may be considered as an early marker of lung involvement in AAT deficiency must be confirmed with studies on larger number of subjects...|$|R

We reasoned that heliox breathing (79 % helium- 21 % oxygen) and the attendant reduction of operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> should accelerate HR kinetics in the transition from rest to high-intensity exercise. Eleven male ambulatory patients with clinically stable COPD undertook constant work-rate cycle testing at 80 % of each individuals' maximum work capacity while breathing room air (RA) or heliox (HX), randomly. Mean response time (MRT) for HR and <b>dynamic</b> end-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (EELV) were measured. Resting EELV was not affected by HX breathing, while exercise EELV decreased significantly by 0. 23 L at isotime during HX breathing compared with RA. During FIX breathing, MRT for HR significantly accelerated (p = 0. 002) by an average of 20 s (i. e., 17 %). Speeded MRT for HR correlated with indices of reduced lung hyperinflation, such as EELV at isotime (r = 0. 88, p = 0. 03), and with improved exercise endurance time (r = - 0. 64, p = 0. 03). The results confirm that HX-induced reduction of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> hyperinflation is associated with consistent improvement in indices of cardio-circulatory function such as HR kinetics in the rest-to-exercise transition in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Children and {{adolescents}} born extremely preterm (EP) have lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and gas transfer capacity than subjects born at term. Most studies also report lower aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that ventilatory efficiency was poorer and that breathing patterns differed in EP−born compared to term−born individuals. Methods: Two area−based cohorts of participants born with gestational age ≤ 28 weeks or birth weight ≤ 1000 g in 1982 − 85 (n = 46) and 1991 – 92 (n = 35) {{were compared with}} individually matched controls born at term. Mean ages were 18 and 10 years, respectively. The participants performed an incremental treadmill exercise test to peak oxygen uptake with data averaged over 20 s intervals. For each participant, the relationship between exhaled minute ventilation (V˙E) and carbon dioxide output (V˙CO 2) was described by a linear model, {{and the relationship between}} tidal volume (VT) and V˙E by a quadratic model. Multivariate regression analyses were done with curve parameters as dependent variables, and the categories EP vs. term−born, sex, age, height, weight and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) as independent variables. Results: In adjusted analyses, the slope of the V˙E−V˙CO 2 relationship was significantly steeper in the EP than the term-born group, whereas no group difference was observed for the breathing pattern, which was related to FEV 1 only. Conclusion: EP-born participants breathed with higher V˙E for any given CO 2 output, indicating lower ventilatory efficiency, possibly contributing to lower aerobic capacity. The breathing patterns did not differ between the EP and term−born groups when adjusted for FEV 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{decreased}} forced expiratory {{volume in}} 1 s/vital capacity (FEV 1 /VC) ratio {{is the hallmark of}} the definition of airway obstruction. We recently suggested that a lung function pattern, we called small airways syndrome (SAOS), has a normal FEV 1 /VC and total lung capacity (TLC) and reflects obstruction of small airways. Objectives: To substantiate our hypothesis we measured and compared lung function tests including maximal expiratory flow rates (MEFR), sensitive indicators of airway obstruction, in SAOS subjects and in matched controls. Methods: We selected 12 subjects with the pattern of SAOS, but without chronic lung or heart disease (average age: 40. 7 +/- 7. 8 years) and 36 age-matched subjects with normal lung function (42. 8 +/- 6. 3 years). We measured static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> MEFR and <b>lung</b> diffusing capacity (DLCO). Results: SAOS subjects were heavier smokers (p < 0. 05) and body mass index was less than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). Both FEV 1 /VC ratio and TLC were comparable in the two groups. However, FEV 1, VC, DLCO, and MEFR were lower and residual volume (RV) and RV/TLC ratio were higher (p < 0. 05) in the SAOS group than in the control one. Furthermore, the MEFR curve of the SAOS group was displaced to the left without any change in slope, suggesting premature airway closure. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a normal FEV 1 /VC ratio does not exclude airway obstruction. A decrease of FEV 1, provided TLC is normal, reflects small airway obstruction.

40|$|The {{functional}} characteristics of six world-class high-altitude mountaineers were assessed 2 - 12 mo {{after the last}} high-altitude climb. Each climber on one or several occasions had reached altitudes of 8, 500 m or above without supplementary O 2. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and right and left echocardiographic measurements {{were found to be}} within normal limits of sedentary controls (SC). Muscle fiber distribution was 70 % type I, 22 % type IIa, and 7 % type IIb. Mean muscle fiber cross-sectional area was significantly smaller than that of SC (- 15 %) and of long-distance runners (LDR, - 51 %). The number of capillaries per unit cross-sectional area was significantly greater than that of SC (+ 40 %). Total mitochondrial volume was not significantly different from that of SC, but its subsarcolemmal component was equal to that of LDR. Average maximal O 2 consumption was 60 +/- 6 ml X kg- 1 X min- 1, which is between the values of SC and LDR. Average maximal anaerobic power was 28 +/- 2. 5 W X kg- 1, which is equal to that of SC and 40 % lower that that of competitive high jumpers. All subjects were characterized by resting hyperventilation both in normoxia and in moderate (inspired O 2 partial pressure = 77 Torr) hypoxia resulting in higher oxyhemoglobin saturation levels in hypoxia. The ventilatory response to four tidal volumes of pure O 2 was similar to that of SC. It is concluded that elite high-altitude climbers do not have physiological adaptations to high altitude that justify their unique performance...|$|R

Effect of biventricular pacing on {{ventilatory}} and perceptual {{responses to}} exercise {{in patients with}} stable chronic heart failure. J Appl Physiol 106 : 1574 - 1583, 2009. First published February 26, 2009; doi: 10. 1152 /japplphysiol. 90744. 2008. -Despite the growing evidence supporting the use of biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), the mechanisms whereby acute hemodynamic improvements lead to improved exertional dyspnea are not precisely known. We hypothesized that improved cardiac function and ventilation-perfusion relations following CRT would reduce ventilatory demand, thereby improving <b>dynamic</b> operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and enhancing tidal volume expansion during exercise. This, in turn, {{would be expected to}} reduce perceived exertional dyspnea and contribute to improved exercise performance. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we compared cardiovascular, metabolic, ventilatory responses (breathing pattern, operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> pulmonary gas exchange) and exertional symptoms in seven stable CHF patients who undertook incremental cardiopulmonary cycle exercise test with CRT switched to the "on" (CRT(on)) or "off" (CRT(off)) modality. Following CRT(on), peak oxygen uptake was significantly increased by 15 %, and dyspnea ratings were lower for a given work rate (at work rate of 40 W, dyspnea = 1 +/- 0. 4 vs. 2. 5 +/- 0. 9 Borg units, P < 0. 05) and ventilation (at ventilation of 31 l/min, dyspnea = 2 +/- 0. 7 vs. 3. 3 +/- 1. 1 Borg units, P < 0. 05). CRT(on) was associated with improvements in ventilatory threshold, oxygen pulse, and oxygen uptake/work rate relationships (10. 2 +/- 1 vs. 7. 9 +/- 1. 3 ml. min(- 1). W(- 1), P < 0. 05). CRT(on) reduced the ventilatory requirement during exercise as well as the steepness of ventilation-CO(2) production slope (35 +/- 4 vs. 45 +/- 7, P < 0. 05). Changes in end-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> during exercise were less with CRT(on) than with CRT(off) (0. 12 vs. 0. 37 liter, P < 0. 05), and breathing pattern was correspondingly slower and deeper. Biventricular pacing improved all noninvasive indexes of cardiac function and oxygen delivery during exercise. The decreased ventilatory demand, improved <b>dynamic</b> operating <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> and the increased ability to expand tidal volume during exercise are potential factors in the reduction of exertional dyspnea...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the severity and functional consequences of weakness of the respiratory muscles in 12 patients with motor neurone disease and 19 patients with myotonic dystrophy. We have also evaluated the control of ventilation and have assessed the influence of both overall respiratory muscle involvement and specific weakness of the diaphragm on various indices of ventilatory control. Measurements were made of chest wall motion, static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> maximum voluntary ventilation, maximum static respiratory (mouth) pressures, mixed venous PCO 2 and various indices derived from the ventilatory response to rebreathing CO 2. In 19 patients (eight motor neurone disease, 11 myotonic dystrophy) direct measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure were made during maximum static inspiratory efforts and during a full inspiration. Respiratory muscle weakness was found in almost all the patients. In motor neurone disease this correlated in general with the overall severity but in myotonic dystrophy its degree was often unsuspected clinically. In both groups of patients reductions in the ventilatory response to CO 2 were common and {{could be attributed to}} weakness. There was no evidence of disproportionate involvement of the diaphragm but the most severely affected patients with motor neurone disease had hypercapnia and evidence of severe diaphragmatic weakness. In myotonic dystrophy the presence of CO 2 retention did not correlate well with the ventilatory response to CO 2, and could not be clearly attributed to weakness of the diaphragm. Grossly irregular patterns of breathing were seen in several patients. A defect of medullary respiratory control has been proposed in myotonic dystrophy but there is no direct evidence for this and the possible influence of disordered afferent information from the diseased muscles remains to be explored...|$|R
