The more complex of these required some fifty handlings {{in and out of the}} press and could take a whole day to complete.

The hand-held {{electric pen}} was powered by a wet cell battery, which was wired to an electric motor mounted {{on top of a}} pen-like shaft. The motor drove a reciprocating needle which, according to the manual, could make 50 punctures per second, or 3,000 per minute. The user was instructed to place the stencil on firm blotting paper on a flat surface, then use the pen to write or draw naturally to form words and designs as a series of minute perforations in the stencil.|$|E
5000|$|On August 4, 1891, {{after several}} prototypes, Blickensderfer {{patented}} The Blickensderfer Type Writing Machine. The central component {{was the use}} of the cylindrical shaped interchangeable type element which he initially patented on July 15, 1890. An earlier variation to Blickensderfer's typewheel was introduced on the Crandall 1 typewriter in 1883 but Blickensderfer's genius was {{in the use of the}} typewheel combined with the simplicity and the small size of his machine. This invention was unlike anything else on the market and was considered a mechanical marvel that took typewriter engineering to a new level. Striking a key turned the wheel to the appropriate orientation while inking the typeface as it tipped downward past the <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> to strike the paper. Holding the Cap or Fig keys shifted the typewheel along its axis to use either the middle row, for capital letters, or the lower row, for special characters and numbers.|$|E

These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the <b>ink</b> form <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R

50|$|David Gestetner {{eventually}} {{moved to}} London, England and in 1881 established the Gestetner Cyclograph Company to produce stencils, styli and <b>ink</b> <b>rollers.</b> He guarded his invention through patents.

50|$|Instead of {{the common}} {{mechanism}} with letters {{on the end of}} individual type bars connected to the keys, the first Blickensderfer prototype used a cylindrical typewheel with four rows of characters; lower case, upper case, italics and short words embossed on it. It was later modified to three rows of characters: lower case, upper case and a row of numbers and symbols. Depressing a key caused the typewheel to turn so the correct letter was positioned over the paper. As the wheel turned it moved downward, contacting an <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> prior to striking the paper. This allowed for greater speed in typing as there were no keys to become jammed or stuck together. The interchangeable typewheel principle is very similar to the IBM Selectric design introduced almost 70 years later in 1961. Like the Selectric, one could easily change the typeface or the font style on a Blickensderfer simply by changing the typewheel.|$|E

2500|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a widely}} used printing technique. Offset printing is where the inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket.

5000|$|On the press, four (up to six) {{different}} <b>ink</b> <b>rollers</b> {{supply the}} colors that will coat the individual printer plates. Printer plates contact a rubberized blanket on a rotating wheel, {{resulting in a}} complete negative color image on the blanket. Clean cans are fed into the printer and are placed on a steel mandrel. The spinning mandrel then rotates the can body against the rotating blanket, resulting in {{the transfer of the}} final graphic image onto the can body. Other coatings are applied after the ink, and then are sent to the UV ovens.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The hard roller {{and soft}} roller are {{alternately}} arranged in the inking system of offset press. The ink vibrator {{is a hard}} roller which transmits the motion to the ink distributing roller. In order to analyze the motion mechanism of the <b>ink</b> <b>roller,</b> a model of an ink distributing roller and an ink vibrator is built up by using the software ANSYS. After the simulation of the motion, the force on the contact area of the ink distributing roller and the rotation speed of both rollers are analyzed. The {{result is that the}} ink distributing roller rotates with tangential force on the contact area and this force increases together with the rotation speed. When the two rollers rotate, the tangential elastic deformation is caused by the tangential force on contact area, and the radial deformation of the ink distributing roller is caused by the pressure. It leads to a relative sliding of the two rollers, which is mainly influenced by the rotation speed of ink vibrator and the radial deformation of ink distributing roller. Meanwhile, to verify the accuracy of the analysis, the rotation speed of the two rollers and the deformation of the ink distributing roller have been measured on a printability tester and then compared with the results of simulation. The analysis of the motion mechanism is very important to the study of printing color quality control...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of multiple organic solvents in offset lithographic printing causing high emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indeed poses a serious risk to printing workers' health. In this study, indoor air quality (IAQ) assessments were carried out in seven printing plants and the main objectives were to understand the effect of VOC emissions on IAQ and develop effective mitigation measures to protect workers. The thorough gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) measurements showed that although a variety of VOCs were presented in the indoor air, {{none of them was}} found close to individual 8 -h time-weighted average (TWA) of the occupational exposure limit (OEL). The additive effect was also found below the critical value of unity. However, short-term personal exposure to total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) was exceedingly high when a print worker carried out blanket and <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> cleaning procedures. Therefore, the occupational health risk was mainly due to repeated short-term exposures during intermittent VOC-emitting procedures rather than long-term exposure to background VOCs. Push-pull local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was identified as an effective mitigation measure. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was conducted to study the push-pull LEV operation. It was found that there existed a threshold LEV air flow rate for an abrupt reduction in the worker's exposure to VOCs. The reduction was less sensitive when the LEV airflow was further increased beyond the threshold. These phenomena, consistent with experimental results reported by other investigators, were explained by detailed CFD analysis showing the competition between the general ventilation and the push-pull LEV to become the dominating driving force for the resultant local flow pattern. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
