40|$|Hot dip <b>galvanizing</b> {{technology}} is now widely {{used as a}} method of protection for steel rebars. The corrosion behaviors of Q 235 carbon steel and hot <b>galvanized</b> steel in a Ca(OH) 2 solution with a pH from 10 to 13 was investigated by electrode potential and polarization curves testing. The results indicated that carbon steel and hot <b>galvanized</b> steel were all passivated in a strong alkaline solution. The electrode potential of hot dip <b>galvanized</b> steel was lower than that of carbon steel; thus, hot dip <b>galvanized</b> steel can provide very good anodic protection for carbon steel. However, when the pH value reached 12. 5, a polarity reversal occurred under the condition of a certain potential. Hot dip <b>galvanized</b> coating became a cathode, and the corrosion of carbon steel accelerated. The electrochemical behaviors and passivation abilities of hot dip <b>galvanized</b> steel and carbon steel were affected by pH. The higher the pH value was, the more easily they were passivated.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{comparatively}} analyzes {{resistance spot}} weldability {{depending on whether}} or not 440 MPa-grade steel is <b>galvanized</b> at inverter DC spot welding. Design/methodology/approach: To compare the resistance spot weldability depending {{on whether or not}} the steel is <b>galvanized,</b> an inverter DC welding system was designed. Then, using this system, both tensile strength testing and macro-section testing were conducted on SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (<b>galvanized</b> steel), and weldability was evaluated. Suitable welding conditions were calculated using the resistance spot welding variables such as electrode force, welding time and lobe diagram on the welding current. The low limit of the lobe diagram was set to the low limit of the tensile strength of 440 MPa-grade steel while the high limit was set depending on whether or not expulsion was detected. Findings: Compared to uncoated steel, <b>galvanized</b> steel had lower suitable welding current conditions anda narrower lobe diagram. Research limitations/implications: This paper compared resistance spot weldability and lobe diagram depending on whether or not 440 MPa-grade steel is <b>galvanized.</b> Practical implications: This paper confirms the weldability of <b>galvanized</b> steel by comparing resistance spot weldability depending on whether or not steel is <b>galvanized.</b> Originality/value: For analysis of resistance spot weldability depending on whether or not steel is <b>galvanized,</b> weldability was compared between SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (<b>galvanized</b> steel) under the same welding conditions. As a result, compared to uncoated steel, <b>galvanized</b> steel had lower suitable welding current conditions and a narrower lobe diagram...|$|R

50|$|Hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> {{surfaces}} are not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684).

25|$|A {{hot button}} issue {{that seemed to}} <b>galvanize</b> the public was the vehicle license fee {{increase}} Davis implemented under provisions of legislation passed by his predecessor which originally reduced the fees.

The increase tripled the vehicle license fee for the average car owner, and began appearing in renewal notices starting August 1. The California state budget passed in late July 2003 included the projected $4 billion in increased vehicle license fee revenue.|$|E
