25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> what she wanted to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E
500|$|Attitudes {{towards the}} suffragette {{movement}} as a whole were badly affected by militant actions led mostly {{by members of the}} WSPU. In July 1908 the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League (WNASL) [...] was inaugurated, with Welsh MP Ivor Guest severing as treasurer. The initial involvement of Ermine Taylor led to a branch of the WNASL being formed in Denbigshire the following year. Undeterred the pro-suffrage groups continued to take direct action. In Bristol in 1908, Winston Churchill had been threatened by WSPU members, and the widespread anger after the event led to a Cardiff meeting led by Charlotte Despard being abandoned. In Merthyr the speakers were drowned out and herrings and tomatoes thrown at them. Despite being a 'favoured son of Wales' and outwardly pro-women's suffrage, Liberal MP, and from 1908, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George was often a target of suffragette activity. Although Lloyd George always stated his support to the suffrage movement in public speeches, the failure of the Liberal Government to make any progress on implementing change led Christabel Pankhurst to believe him to be a secret anti-suffragist. Pankhurst was quoted in the Times in November 1911 declaring [...] "'Lloyd Georgitis' seemed to be a disease which afflicted men to-day with very few exceptions. But women saw through him. They <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> him as an anti-suffragist, and they must fight him here and now." [...] Pankhurst's assumptions had a basis of truth, as a month before Lloyd George had written to the Liberal Party chief whip bemoaning the fact that the forthcoming Conciliation Bill would hand hundreds of thousands of votes to the Tory party.|$|E
2500|$|After Rep. Mark Foley {{resigned}} in October 2006, following revelations {{he had sent}} sexually explicit e-mails to teenage congressional pages, Ryun contended that he barely knew Foley, had never spent time with him and was unaware that they lived {{directly across the street}} from each other in Washington, D.C. [...] "I know that [...] only because somebody has mentioned that, too, already," [...] he told reporters at the time. However, it was later revealed that Ryun and Foley had hosted a joint fundraiser on their street on May 18, 2006, called the [...] "D Street Block Party." [...] An invitation to the fundraiser included side-by-side pictures of Ryun and Foley. Ryun's campaign manager later said that Ryun <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> he was Foley's neighbor.|$|E

2500|$|In 1853, Wyld {{arranged}} with the prospector John Calvert to exhibit {{a collection of}} gold nuggets and precious stones discovered in Australia. The [...] "gold" [...] was later discovered to be gilded lead casts. Wyld started a court case against Calvert claiming {{that he had been}} deceived, but Calvert told the jury that Wyld <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> that the genuine nuggets would not be displayed, had overseen the preparation of the casts and had even planned to drum up ticket sales with an elaborate publicity campaign based around a faked robbery, a charge that Wyld vehemently denied, stating that [...] "no one but one who had been the associate of convicts for fifteen years would have ventured to suggest such a question" [...] (a none-too-subtle reference to Calvert's time spent in Australia). The jury in the case was unable to reach a verdict, and while opinions differed on whether Wyld had been duped, it was clear that with topical exhibitions he had found a way to reinvigorate the attraction.|$|E
2500|$|Peter David {{returned}} to the character in another limited series, Aquaman: Time and Tide, a 1993–1994 four-issue series which further explained Aquaman's origins, as he finally learns all {{about the history of}} his people through the Atlantis Chronicles, which are presented as historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries. Aquaman learns that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy Ocean Master share the same father, [...] "an ancient Atlantean wizard" [...] named Atlan. This revelation sends Orin into a bout of rage and depression, setting the stage for later confrontations between the two, as it is said in the Chronicles that [...] "two brothers will also battle for control of Atlantis". This is in contrast to the Silver Age Aquaman, who <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> that the Ocean Master was his half-brother Orm, although Orm's amnesia prevented him from remembering that fact for some time. This series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping the character reach the height of his modern-era popularity.|$|E
2500|$|The Legion of Super Heroes in the 31st Century series, {{based upon}} the {{television}} series {{of the same name}} presents another Booster incarnation. This time, he appears as a selfish and glory-seeking young hero, operating in the 31st century against a group of High-Tech thieves known as the [...] "Scavengers", but really selling stolen technology to the same villains he fights in exchange for payment of his father's gambling debts. Before the Legion can confront him about his thefts, using a stolen Green Lantern ring with limited time-travel abilities, he tries to follow the Chief Scavenger, escaping in a Time Bubble like the one often used by the main continuity Booster. Before disappearing into the timestream, he begs the Legion to bring his love to his sister, [...] "the only one who always believed in me." [...] At the Legion's headquarters, Brainiac 5 reveals he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> of Booster's technology thefts, but having read in historical chronicles how Booster Gold is destined to redeem himself acting {{as one of the greatest}} and most selfless crimefighters of the 21st century, he arranges for Booster to find and easily steal the very items he needs to be an effective crimefighter: a Legion flight ring, LexCorp experimental blaster gauntlets, and power cells employed by the Science Police. This version of Booster Gold, resembling a teenaged Booster, always travels with a version of Skeets, resembling closely the advanced 2.0 model built by Doc Magnus after 52.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, Viki is {{introduced}} to a new man, Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), who admired Viki's father and Dorian's dead husband, Victor. Sloan writes a biography of Victor entitled, [...] "Lord of The Banner", which implicates Dorian (Strasser, onward) in his death. Dorian is deeply offended by this and wages war on Sloan. Sloan plants seeds of intrigue in Viki's mind, and Viki goes to the Llanview police requesting they reopen the investigation on her father's death. An autopsy of Victor finds pillow threads in his lungs, leading them {{to believe that he}} was smothered with a pillow. Dorian is then assumed to be guilty and brought to trial for the crime. Dorian is found guilty for the murder of Victor Lord—18 years after the fact. Dorian, however, is aided by a young reported, David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) who forged an entry into Irene Manning's diary, implicating Irene in the murder. Dorian is freed and plots revenge against Viki. Dorian seduced Viki's son, Joey Riley Buchanan (Nathan Fillion) and causes a rift between Joey and Viki, just as she had caused between Victor and Viki almost 20 years before. Viki is even more disturbed when Sloan died in early 1995, shortly after their wedding. Viki confronts Dorian and splits into a new personality, [...] "Jean Randolph", when Dorian reveals to Viki that Victor had molested Viki as a child—a fact which was implied throughout the series, that Viki was not consciously aware of, and that Dorian <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> since her marriage to Victor in the 1970s, when he remarked of such events in his sleep. Jean Randolph imprisoned Dorian in Victor's secret room for months. Eventually, Dorian is released and blackmailed by Jean into (invalidly) marrying David. Viki eventually undergoes therapy, and it is discovered that Viki, not Dorian, had indeed murdered Victor in 1976. This revelation exonerates Dorian from wrongdoing, though she confesses to Viki that she withheld Victor's medication as he suffered from a heart attack (a fact never shown on-screen). Viki and Dorian reconcile, but only temporarily.|$|E
