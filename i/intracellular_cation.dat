An adequate gradient of potassium across the cell membrane is {{necessary in order to}} enable excitability of cell membranes. This is particularly important for nerve and muscle function.

As kidney failure progresses, with a consequent decline of excretory function, potassium is likely to accumulate with probable harmful effects on the cellular membrane potential and cardiac arrhythmias as the primary symptom. If the physiological potassium blood level of between 3.8 mmol/L and 5.2 mmol/L is exceeded, hyperkalaemia is diagnosed. The mainstay of the treatment for chronic kidney disease patients is potassium removal through the dialysis procedure.

The washing effect on extracellular contaminants could agree with the theoretical equation of washing that the contaminant decreased exponentially. The successive decrease of assay values by an easy grade must show a leakage of the intracellular Na. The reflective point could be considerated to show the Na content. 2. As in general potassium concentration in cells is higher than in medium, the accurate value was decided by extrapolation of the linear analytical quantity vs. washing time to zero time. 3.

40|$|In cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), epithelial cells {{are unable to}} normally up-regulate apical membrane Cl- secretion in response to agents which increase cyclic AMP, but they do increase Cl- secretion in response to increases in intracellular Ca 2 +. Since <b>intracellular</b> divalent <b>cations</b> regulate the expression of many genes, we hypothesized that mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + and/or other divalent cations might modulate not only Ca(2 +) -dependent Cl- channels but also {{cystic fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene expression. To evaluate this concept, HT- 29 human colon carcinoma cells were cultured under various conditions designed to manipulate <b>intracellular</b> divalent <b>cation</b> concentrations and CFTR gene expression was quantified at the levels of transcription, mRNA accumulation, mRNA half-life, and protein. Exposure to the divalent cation ionophores A 23187 and ionomycin (agents which increase <b>intracellular</b> divalent <b>cation</b> concentrations) caused dose- and time-dependent reductions of CFTR mRNA levels, which could be blocked {{by the use of}} Ca(2 +) - and Mg(2 +) -free media. Ionophore-induced CFTR gene modulation was also observed with T 84 human colon carcinoma cells and freshly isolated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Incubation of HT- 29 cells with thapsigargin, an agent that releases Ca 2 + from intracellular stores, or in medium containing increased extracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + also caused down-regulation of CFTR mRNA levels. Transcription run-on analysis showed that, parallel with the decrease in CFTR mRNA levels, A 23187 reduced the rate of transcription of the CFTR gene, while CFTR mRNA transcript half-life was unaffected. Consistent with the down-regulation of CFTR gene expression, CFTR protein levels also decreased after exposure to A 23187. Thus, despite the independence of Ca(2 +) -dependent Cl- channels and cyclic AMP-dependent CFTR-related Cl- channels in epithelial cells, increases in <b>intracellular</b> divalent <b>cation</b> concentrations down-regulate the expression of the CFTR gene at the transcriptional level, with consequent decreases in CFTR mRNA and protein...|$|R

This residue interacts directly with <b>intracellular</b> divalent <b>cations</b> and determines the ionic selectivity. Therefore, we confirmed our proposition by localizing the divalent cation-binding site within the conduction pathway of the SKCa channel.
