500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I think we might have killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E

2500|$|The mid-1960s {{to early}} 1970s were {{an even more}} {{successful}} time period for Warwick, who saw a string of gold-selling albums and Top 20 and Top 10 hit singles. [...] "Message to Michael", a Bacharach-David composition that the duo was certain was a [...] "man's song", became a top 10 hit for Warwick in May 1966. The January 1967 LP Here Where There Is Love was her first RIAA certified Gold album, and featured [...] "Alfie" [...] and two 1966 hits: [...] "Trains and Boats and Planes" [...] and [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself". [...] "Alfie" [...] had become a radio hit when disc jockeys across the nation began to play the album cut early in 1967. [...] "Alfie" [...] was released as the [...] "B" [...] side of a Bacharach/David ballad, [...] "The Beginning of Loneliness", which charted in the Hot 100. [...] Disc jockeys flipped the single {{and made it a}} double-sided hit. Bacharach had been contracted to produce [...] "Alfie" [...] for the Michael Caine film of the same name and wanted Warwick to sing the tune, but the British producers wanted a British subject to cut the tune. Cilla Black was selected to record the song, and her version peaked at #95 upon its release in the US. [...] A cover version by Cher used in the American prints of the film peaked at #33. In the UK and Australia, Black's version was a Top 10 hit. In a 1983 concert appearance televised on PBS, Warwick stated she was the 43rd person to record [...] "Alfie," [...] at Bacharach's insistence, who felt Warwick could make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit. She at first balked at recording the tune and asked Bacharach [...] "How many more versions of Alfie do you need?" [...] to which he replied [...] "Just one more, yours." [...] Bacharach took Warwick into the studio with his new arrangement and cut the tune the way he wanted it to be, which she nailed in one take. Her version peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on both the R Chart and the AC Charts. She performed the song at the Academy Awards in 1967. Today [...] "Alfie" [...] is considered a signature song for Warwick.|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
