Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> few of the scenes with Eskimo women when coverage {{was found to be}} lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E

He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E

These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E

25|$|Rees is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest British golfers never to win The Open Championship. He finished as runner-up three times, in 1953, 1954 and 1961, but perhaps his best chance of victory came in 1946, when <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> final round 80 to slip into a tie for 4th place.|$|E

Going into the back 9 on Sunday, he had a chance of winning his second title of 2012 in as many weeks due to the leaders faltering. However two late bogeys halted his chance and he settled for 3rd place, two strokes behind winner Justin Rose.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy's first tournament of {{the year}} was at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship during the desert swing of the European Tour at the end of January.

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} an 8 mm film movie camera for his 17th birthday, <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> documentary about an Ann Arbor factory. He graduated from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor in 1971. Turning down reduced tuition at the University of Michigan, he attended Hampshire College, an alternative school in Amherst, Massachusetts, where students are graded through narrative evaluations rather than letter grades and where students create self-directed academic concentrations instead of choosing a traditional major. He {{worked in a}} record store to pay his tuition. Studying under photographers Jerome Liebling, Elaine Mayes and others, Burns earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in film studies and design in 1975.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance {{towards the end of}} the film, but {{according}} to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed to be the one who was killed. The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative. To satisfy the studio heads, <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss, Thomas Bateman, being interviewed on television. Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original.|$|E

Born into a middle-class family, Inzunza Inzunza attended grade and middle school at Colegio Sinaloa, a religious institution.

25|$|Nelson won {{his first}} major title at The Masters in 1937, two shots ahead of runner-up Ralph Guldahl. During this tournament <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> first-round 66, which was the lowest first round score at the Masters until 1976, when Raymond Floyd had 65 en route to his victory. Nelson won four more majors, the U.S. Open in 1939, the PGA Championship in 1940 and 1945, and a second Masters in 1942. Nelson had a blood {{disorder}} that caused his blood to clot four times slower than normal, which {{kept him out of}} military service during World War II. It has sometimes mistakenly been reported that he had hemophilia; this is not true. During the war, Nelson gave hundreds of golf exhibitions across the country to raise money for charitable causes.|$|E
25|$|On 26 May 1917, Gilmour {{received}} the Military Cross for his prowess as a bombing formation leader. At this point, {{he was almost}} certainly still flying the Martinsyde. Late in 1917, Gilmour was assigned to No. 65 Squadron RAF as a flight commander. After a fourteen-month gap in his aerial victory list, he scored flying a Sopwith Camel, on 18 December 1917. His two triumphs that day made him an ace. <b>He</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> triple on 4 January 1918, including one down in flames, and followed it up with number eight on 9 January.

25|$|His third win {{came after}} he took command of a newly formed unit, Flik 19. Flying with Benno Fiala Ritter von Fernbrugg as his observer, Heyrowsky shot down the Italian airship M4 on 4 May 1916. Even as Heyrowsky was reopening his victory list, he was also {{volunteering}} {{to serve as an}} infantry officer in the ongoing Battle of Isonzo in his time off from flying. During August, he was forced to land on two consecutive days, even as he picked up two more wins and became an ace. Heyrowsky would continue to score right through 26 June 1917, when <b>he</b> <b>shot</b> <b>a</b> double. He was shot down again in October, evaded capture, and was removed from combat duty for staff work. He began as staff officer for aviation for the Second Army, and moved up to become the air liaison officer to Generalleutnant Ernst Wilhelm von Hoeppner.|$|E
