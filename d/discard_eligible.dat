50|$|Frame Relay {{connections}} are often given a {{committed information rate}} (CIR) and an allowance of burstable bandwidth known as the extended information rate (EIR). The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the C rate, and sometimes the PRa rate should there be adequate bandwidth. Frames that are sent {{in excess of the}} CIR are marked as <b>discard</b> <b>eligible</b> (DE) which means they can be dropped should congestion occur within the Frame Relay network. Frames sent in excess of the EIR are dropped immediately.|$|E
40|$|Frame Relay is a {{data packet}} service which anables users uses one {{transmission}} link {{at the same}} time. The data packet is transmitted in frame that consist of f 1 ag, header, payload, and frame ckeck sequence Connection orientation is a major feature of frame relay. The features of those network that it exploits are the low error-rate characteristic and software-based switching. Frame relay combines the advantage of leased line, circuit transport, and packet transport by offers the user the low end-to-end delay and ability to handle bursty data. Frame relay provides three types of virtual circuit: permanent, multicast, and switched. The basic mechanism of frame relay is if there is the problem by handling a frame {{so it will be}} discard. The discard frame is caused by bit error or congestion. The discard frame is marked DE (<b>discard</b> <b>eligible).</b> Recover from error is responsibility of end-user eguipment not by network where if number sequence of frame is losed, receiver will request retransmission. This function occurs in layer 4 of OS!. Important thing that shoud be known by consumer is CIR (committed information rate) that representate warrant minimum bandwidth that can be found by user in busy hour traffic condition. Frame relay is also developed to serve voice communication but there are two main problems: public frame relay network transmit frames in the first come first serve and variation lenght of frame relay depend on its application, that will obtain variable delay, that is a big problem for sensitive traffic to delay like voice...|$|E
50|$|On 21 March, José Luis Rugamas {{released}} {{the list of}} 18 players to face Cuba. Henry Hernández, Milton Molina, Edwin Sánchez, Gilberto Baires, Henry Escobar and Reynaldo Hernández were <b>discarded,</b> but were <b>eligible</b> for the next preliminary squad against Jamaica. The game was played on the 24 March. A long outside kick by substituted midfielder Dennis Alas gave La Selecta a victory over the Cuban side at the Estadio Pedro Marrero in Havana, Cuba. The game saw Brazilian-born Marcelo Messias' debut and the comeback of both Miguel Montes, after a 1-year suspension, and Ramón Sánchez. Luis Anaya, Ramón Sánchez and Dagoberto Portillo were injured by the constant contacts by the Cubans.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{landings}} obligation (or ‘discard ban’) {{included in}} the new EU Common Fisheries Policy prohibits the discarding of species subject to catch limits and those subject to minimum size limits in the Mediterranean Sea. However, some exemptions may apply, and to this end a discards management plan is required. Based on the recent joint recommendations for discard management plans in the Mediterranean, it was identified {{that in order to}} compile an <b>eligible</b> future <b>discard</b> management plan for the Mediterranean fisheries and apply for any exemption, a series of steps will have to be taken towards defining a legal framework under which Mediterranean fisheries can be assessed for their performance. The current system seems inadequate to document actual catches, urges to be updated and above all disqualifies Mediterranean fisheries from been granted any <b>eligible</b> <b>discard</b> management plan. The current long-standing legislative framework, tailored to deal with the ‘peculiarities’ of Mediterranean fisheries by establishing an effort-based management scheme, has now become an immovable obstacle towards dealing with unwanted catches. Mediterranean stakeholders will have to decide if it is worth moving from an effort-based to a catch-based management system, or if the benefits realized by the former would be difficult to be counterbalanced under any other system...|$|R
