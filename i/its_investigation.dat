5|$|In 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations studied several {{still and}} motion images, {{including}} an enhanced {{version of the}} Altgens photograph, in the scope of <b>its</b> <b>investigation.</b> The committee also concluded that Lovelady was the man pictured in the depository doorway.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{committee}} investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|After the Navy closed <b>its</b> <b>investigation,</b> Thompson {{continued}} his own {{research into the}} explosion and its aftermath. Thompson was assisted by Snyder and other former Navy personnel, including Iowa crewmen and Navy headquarters staff members. Family members of the victims as well as staff members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees also helped Thompson. In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act requests to the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed depositions taken from Navy leaders and investigators during {{a lawsuit against the}} Navy by Hartwig's family.|$|E

For example, Silvan is a CICAP sympathizer and has collaborated with CICAP in some of its initiatives.|$|R
5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E
5|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{especially}} {{noted for its}} depiction of oppression, nationalism and xenophobia, and for <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans. It is also connected {{with the end of}} Communist Yugoslavia and the onset of the Yugoslav wars: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location, and continued to refer to it in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|During December 2011, GM {{conducted}} four crash {{tests of}} Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt {{to the same}} test {{that led to the}} original fire, with no signs of the damage that {{is believed to have been}} the cause. The NHTSA said “the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion” though <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> remained open. General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of <b>its</b> <b>investigation,</b> the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in the tower working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either in the tower or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar). At {{the time of the}} accident, the single controller in the tower was performing both tower and radar duties. On August 30, 2006, the FAA announced that Lexington, as well as other airports with similar traffic levels, would be staffed with two controllers in the tower around the clock effective immediately.|$|E

Crittenden and George M. Bibb requesting their legal aid in the matter. Neither letter was answered. Meanwhile, Beauchamp's uncle, a state senator, gathered a defense team that included former U.S. Senator John Pope.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff.

5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion {{could have been an}} accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen <b>its</b> <b>investigation,</b> the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry.|$|E

They were assessed fines of $620,000, the highest civil penalty ever levied for {{a violation of the}} act.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram of powder bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed <b>its</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

5|$|McCarthy's {{hearings}} are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). HUAC {{is best known}} for the investigation of Alger Hiss and for <b>its</b> <b>investigation</b> of the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC was a House committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938-1975).|$|E
5|$|NIS {{investigators}} {{tried to}} prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt {{had had a}} homosexual relationship {{with each other and}} that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later said to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during <b>its</b> <b>investigation,</b> NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.|$|E

Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011.
