5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill. There was {{blood in his}} sputum, but <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> recover, {{although}} he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Ann Shulgin {{reported}} on Facebook {{that her husband}} had developed liver cancer, and in a May 31 update on Facebook she said that, although appearing frail, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be experiencing his last moments in peace and without pain. On June 2, 2014, Shulgin died at home in bed surrounded by family, fifteen days before his 89th birthday.|$|E

5|$|The Monk {{wrote of}} the event in the Histoire de Charles VI (History of Charles VI), {{covering}} about 25 years of the King's reign. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> disapprove {{on the grounds that}} the event broke social mores and the King's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart described it as a celebratory event.|$|E
5|$|Celtic again {{qualified}} for the UEFA Champions League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save {{near the end of}} the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be clean through on goal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1930 Aiello {{arranged}} several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Capone bodyguards, including Jack McGurn, Phil D'Andrea and Rocco De Grazia. Aiello hoped to leave Capone vulnerable by depleting his security, and Capone began to suspect Aiello had spies within the Chicago Outfit because <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have inside knowledge about where his targets would be and when. In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted a raid on Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago.|$|E

6000|$|The old man {{shook his}} head slowly, smiled and put down his cup. [...] "I don't know which either. He goes very far, but it's quite {{possible}} he doesn't go far enough. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> want to do away with a good many things, but <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> want to remain himself. I suppose that's natural, but it's rather inconsistent." ...|$|R
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|Hsu then {{returned}} to the United States in the late 1990s, despite his fugitive status, and established several addresses in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. He became an investor in Silicon Valley, invested in real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area, and still had engagements in the garment industry. He later relocated to New York, where <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become involved in the apparel business once again and lived in a luxury apartment in SoHo while flying chartered jets.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2010, a Brendan Casey (also {{known as}} scient) {{released}} an unofficial patch, which fixes bugs in Alpha Centauri. His project began in February 2009 at Apolyton's Alpha Centauri site, {{and moved in}} June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network, where he planned to continue developing further patch versions. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have resumed work in March 2013 at the http://alphacentauri2.info fan site. Currently, the subsequent patches of other modders generally build upon scient's original 1.0 patch. There is a graphics update, Artificial Intelligence update, and an additional modifications patch amongst others there.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his four-year college eligibility, Bowen was {{eligible for the}} 1993 NBA draft, but went undrafted. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be destined to become a journeyman athlete. Between 1993 and 1997, Bowen played for five different teams, starting his professional career for the French teams of Le Havre in 1993–94 and Évreux the following season. In 1995–96 {{he played in the}} CBA with Rockford Lightning; he spent the next season back in France with Besançon, before returning to the Lightning in February 1997. Bowen made his NBA debut when he was signed to a ten-day contract by the Miami Heat the following month. His output consisted of 1 game, 1 minute and 1 block.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee {{for the office of}} Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege, and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E

5|$|During the 2013 preseason, Hemingway led the Chiefs in receptions and touchdowns. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{have moved}} into the fourth wide {{receiver}} position behind Dwayne Bowe, Donnie Avery, and Dexter McCluster. In the 2013 Chiefs season opener, he caught a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had his college freshman season quarterback Chad Henne and his redshirt senior season quarterback Denard Robinson on their roster. The reception, which came from Alex Smith, was Hemingway's first in the NFL. Hemingway had a three-reception game that included the game's opening score on December 1 against the Denver Broncos. In {{the final game of}} the season, he had 5 receptions for 45 yards, giving him 13 receptions and 125 yards for the season. Hemingway also posted 2 receptions for the Chiefs in the 2013–14 NFL playoffs against Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|From Ravenna, Diocletian {{left for}} the Danube. There, {{possibly}} in Galerius' company, he {{took part in a}} campaign against the Carpi. He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a litter. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304–5 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumors alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it was only retrieved by public declarations of his survival. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{comic opera}} The Perfect Fool (1923) was {{widely seen as}} a satire of Parsifal, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically {{received}} at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> make a good recovery, and he felt up to accepting {{an invitation to the}} US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor's orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul's Girls' School, but did not return to any of his other posts.|$|E

5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> improve for a few days, and was even able to go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E
5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E
