All applications where {{the engine was}} used initially put out [...] at 3800 rpm and 215 lbft Nm of torque at 2400 rpm. Engines upgraded with Ford's EEC-V Powertrain Control Module (PCM) received a small increase in output to , {{if they did not}} have other enhancements to increase output beyond this already. The 1991-1995 Police Package Taurus, 1991-1994 Lincoln Continental and 1995 Ford Windstar had a high-output version of the 3.8 with better cylinder heads and other modifications. It produced 155-160 hp (116-119 kW) and 220-225 lb·ft (298-305 N·m) of torque depending on application and model year.A supercharged version of the 3.8 L V6 was used in the 1989-1995 Thunderbird Super Coupe and 1989-90 Cougar XR-7. Initial output of the engine was [...] at 4000 rpm and 315 lbft Nm of torque at 2600 rpm under an 8.2:1 compression ratio. The Super Coupe was the sole user of this engine after the beginning of the 1991 model year when it was replaced by a V8 in the Cougar XR-7. Output of the supercharged V6 was increased to [...] at 4400 rpm and 330 lbft Nm of torque at 2500 rpm for the 1994 and 1995 Super Coupe. To accomplish this, the engine's Eaton M90 roots-type supercharger was given a larger, square-style inlet, a larger attaching <b>inlet</b> <b>plenum,</b> and Teflon coated rotors. Additionally, the engine received larger fuel injectors and an increase in compression to 8.6:1.|$|E
5000|$|The Super Coupe {{continued}} on for 1994 {{with the same}} supercharged 3.8 L V6 as before, but now with [...] at 4400 rpm and 330 lbft Nm of torque at 2500 rpm.

The Eaton M90 roots-type supercharger was given a larger, square style inlet, a larger attaching <b>inlet</b> <b>plenum,</b> and Teflon coated rotors. The engine received larger fuel injectors and an increase in compression to 8.6:1. In their March 1996 issue, Motor Trend magazine conducted a comparison test of a 1995 Thunderbird Super Coupe against the front-wheel drive Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34 and a Buick Regal Gran Sport. The Super Coupe delivered the best overall performance, including a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 7.0 seconds and a completion of a quarter-mile in 15.2 seconds at 88.1 mph. In summarizing the overall performance of each car relative to each other, the author of the article, Don Sherman, wrote, [...] "The Buick Regal is a competent, comfortable car at an attractive price, but it's too androgynous to be called a Gran Sport. Nothing about it is grand, and there isn't a sporting bone in its body. All the Monte Carlo needs to succeed is a V-8 engine and a year of refinement to eradicate its quality bugs. That leaves the Thunderbird SC as this test's big winner. It's a far more sophisticated solution to the four-place-coupe equation, but is priced accordingly." [...] In spite of positive critiques like this, the increases in output and performance over earlier Super Coupes would be short-lived, as the Thunderbird Super Coupe was discontinued after the 1995 model year due to slowing sales.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experimental results are presented for a two-bladed pocket damper seal (PDS) with eight partition walls on a high-speed test rig. The objective of these experiments is to measure damping coefficients, stiffness coefficients and leakage rates at higher frequencies than tested previously. The seal coefficients are determined by measuring the logarithmic decrement and damped natural frequency in non-rotating free vibration tests and by computer simulations of these results using a computer program called XLTRC. Rotating tests, which consist of coastdown tests from 14000 rpm to 0 rpm were also conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the PDS in suppressing the vibration amplitudes at the critical speeds. The initial rotating tests on the originally designed PDS were discouraging, and highlight the importance of the optimum design of the <b>inlet</b> <b>plenum</b> chamber of the PDS in producing damping. Suitable modifications are carried out in the PDS <b>inlet</b> <b>plenum</b> design and the non-rotating tests were repeated on the modified PDS. These tests show positive damping and negative stiffness in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The tests also show that the magnitude of both the damping and the stiffness coefficients increase with the inlet pressure.

40|$|Abstract—Air {{intake system}} and filter play {{major role in}} getting good quality air into {{automobile}} engine. It improves the combustion efficiency and also reduces air pollution. This paper focuses on optimizing the geometry of an intake system in automobile industry to reduce the pressure drop and enhance the filter utilization area by adding guide vane. 3 D viscous Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was carried out for an existing model to understand the flow behavior through the intake system, air filter geometry and ducting. Results obtained from CFD analysis of the existing model showed good improvement. Based on existing model CFD results, geometrical changes like guide vane placement in <b>inlet</b> <b>plenum</b> of the filter, optimization of mesh size, removal of contraction in clean pipe of intake system etc are carried out, to improve the flow characteristics. The CFD analysis of the optimized model was again carried out and the results showed good improvement in flow behavior. By using 3 D CFD analysis, optimal design of the intake system for an automobile engine is achieved with considerable reduction in development time and cost.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effects of channel surface wettability and temperature gradients on the boiling flow pattern in a single microchannel. The test section consists of a bottom silicon substrate bonded with a top glass cover. Three consecutive parts of an <b>inlet</b> fluid <b>plenum,</b> a central microchannel and an outlet fluid plenum were etched in the silicon substrate. The central microchannel had a width of 800 mu m and a depth of 30 mu m. Acetone liquid was used as the working fluid. High outlet vapor qualities were dealt with here. The flow pattern consists of a fluid triangle (shrinkage of the liquid films) and a connected long liquid rivulet, which is generated in the central microchannel in the timescale of milliseconds. The peculiar flow pattern is formed due to the following reasons: (1) the liquid rivulet tends to have a large contact area with the top hydrophilic channel surface of the glass cover, but a smaller contact area with the bottom silicon hydrophobic surface. (2) The temperature gradient in the chip width direction at the top channel surface of the glass cover not only causes the shrinkage of the liquid films in the central microchannel upstream, but also attracts the liquid rivulet populated near the microchannel centerline. (3) The zigzag pattern is formed due to the competition between the evaporation momentum forces at the vapor-liquid interfaces and the force due to the Marangoni effect. The former causes the rivulet to deviate from the channel centerline and the latter draws the rivulet toward the channel centerline. (4) The temperature gradient along the flow direction in the central microchannel downstream causes the breakup of the rivulet to form isolated droplets there. (5) Liquid stripes inside the upstream fluid triangle were caused by the small capillary number of the liquid film, at which the large surface tension force relative to the viscous force tends to populate the liquid film locally on the top glass cover surface.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) electrochemical model has been created for detailed analysis of a high-temperature electrolysis stack (solid oxide fuel cells operated as electrolyzers). <b>Inlet</b> and outlet <b>plenum</b> flow distributions are discussed. Maldistribution of plena flow show deviations in per-cell operating conditions due to non-uniformity of species concentrations. Models have also been created to simulate experimental conditions and for code validation. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results are discussed. Mass, momentum, energy, and species conservation and transport are provided via the core features of the commercial CFD code FLUENT. A solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) model adds the electrochemical reactions and loss mechanisms and computation of the electric field throughout the cell. The FLUENT SOFC user-defined subroutine was modified for this work to allow for operation in the electrolysis mode. Model results provide detailed profiles of temperature, Nernst potential, operating potential, activation over-potential, anode-side gas composition, cathode-side gas composition, current density and hydrogen production over a range of stack operating conditions. Variations in flow distribution, and species concentration are discussed. End effects of flow and per-cell voltage are also considered. Predicted mean outlet hydrogen and steam concentrations vary linearly with current density, as expected. Contour plots of local electrolyte temperature, current density, and Nernst potential indicate the effects of heat transfer, reaction cooling/heating, and change in local gas composition...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} flowpath {{analysis of}} a single-tube airbreathing pulse detonation engine is described. The configura-tion consists of a steady supersonic <b>inlet,</b> a large <b>plenum,</b> a valve, and a straight detonation tube (no exit nozzle). The interaction of the filling process with the detonation is studied, and it is shown how the flow in the plenum is coupled with the flow in the detonation tube. This coupling results in total pressure losses and pressure oscillations in the plenum caused by the unsteadiness of the flow. Moreover, the filling process generates a moving flow into which the detonation has to initiate and propagate. An analytical model is developed for predicting the flow and estimating performance based on an open-system control volume analysis and gasdynamics. The existing single-cycle impulse model is extended to include the effect of filling velocity on detonation tube impulse. Based on this, the engine thrust {{is found to be}} the sum of the contributions of detonation tube impulse, momentum, and pressure terms. Performance calculations for pulse detonation engines operating with stoichiometric hydrogen–air and JP 10 –air are presented and compared to the performance of the ideal ramjet over a range of Mach numbers.
