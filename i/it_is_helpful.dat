5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E

25|$|To {{relate the}} memristor to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> {{to isolate the}} term M(q), which characterizes the device, and write it as a {{differential}} equation.|$|E

30|$|<b>It</b> may <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> {{first to}} enumerate the {{features}} that I shall be referring to.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>helpful</b> {{that the}} USSR press service, TASS, always {{announced}} new Soviet satellite or space probe launches promptly, so Space Track {{was free to}} discuss the new objects without worrying about compromising sources. Translations of the Russian announcements were provided by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS).|$|R
25|$|Astronomers are {{interested}} in studying this galaxy as it can help in measuring extragalactic distances. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> because it possesses two tools used to estimate astronomical distances: a stellar explosion, or supernova; and Cepheid variable stars.|$|E
25|$|To plot other points, whose angles are {{not such}} round numbers as 60° and 50°, one must {{visually}} interpolate between the nearest grid lines. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> {{to have a}} net with finer spacing than 10°. Spacings of 2° are common.|$|E
25|$|All real fluids (except superfluids) {{offer some}} {{resistance}} to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> to use {{the concept of an}} inviscid fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no {{resistance to shearing}} and so is not viscous.|$|E

5000|$|LDDQU — As stated above, {{this is an}} {{alternative}} misaligned integer vector load. <b>It</b> can <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> for video compression tasks.|$|R
25|$|Amber is {{a unique}} preservational mode, {{preserving}} otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms; the chemical composition of the resin, however, is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.|$|E
25|$|Since Usher {{syndrome}} is incurable at present, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> to diagnose children well before they develop the characteristic night blindness. Some preliminary {{studies have suggested}} as many as 10% of congenitally deaf children may have Usher syndrome. However, a misdiagnosis can have bad consequences.|$|E
25|$|In the night, or in a ship without windows, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> {{to simply}} close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This {{resolves}} the input {{conflict between the}} eyes and the inner ear. Napping also helps prevent psychogenic effects (i.e. the effect of sickness being magnified by thinking about it).|$|E

25|$|To capture what {{is special}} about Francis’ {{theology}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> {{to let him}} speak in his own words: the specialty is often watered down in generalizations. His statements have been well described as “snarky” and “stunners”. The fervor of his determination to turn around the church appears in his way of expressing himself.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the propagation of}} action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> to consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the axon hillock. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing. There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> {{to demonstrate how}} it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the {{uncertainty principle}}. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates {{it in a way}} that generalizes more easily.|$|E

40|$|Portable, real-time, B-mode {{ultrasonography}} {{was used}} by surgeons to diagnose acute soft tissue infections in intravenous drug abusers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>helpful</b> in differentiating simple cellulitis from abscess and in detecting pseudoaneurysm and thrombophlebitis. The authors conclude that ultrasonography as an initial diagnostic method for these types of lesions provides both early diagnosis and early treatment, thereby shortening hospital stay and reducing complications...|$|R
25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> to understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is required}} to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> to evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture toughness material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture toughness. It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> if divers {{wear their}} {{equipment}} {{in a way}} that follows standardised conventions so that buddy partners will know where to access that equipment if they are called on to assist their buddy. As there are several conventions, and divers who do not follow the locally popular conventions, it is important for divers planning to dive as buddies to familiarise themselves with the configuration used by the other in the pre-dive checks.|$|E

30|$|We {{wanted to}} see whether the score could be used to predict ease of correction. From experience, we had learned that an older child {{requires}} more casting and we agreed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to incorporate a multiplier variable according to the age of the child into our final score. As all elements are made stiffer with age, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>helpful</b> to multiply the combined elements by this factor.|$|R
