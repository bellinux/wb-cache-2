40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> {{acceleration}} measurement system for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The system was composed of two 3 -axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of touch sensors made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital (AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls, with these sensors, were attached to subject’s index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the touch sensors were recorded using the PC during the <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> movements. Intervals between the single <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> movements were calculated from the measured output of the touch sensors. Velocities during the single <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> intervals, average of maximum single <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> velocities and average of maximum single <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The developed system was used to conduct <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson’s diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous <b>finger</b> <b>taps</b> movement for 60 s.

40|$|Though <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> has widely {{been used}} for {{coordination}} tasks, {{this is the first}} study to investigate <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> as a relaxation technique. This study will use heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of stress and relaxation. This experiment will determine if <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> can be utilized to increase HRV by lowering heart rate. Using Biopac MP 35 to measure cardiac activity and respiration, we instructed subject to start <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> at a steady pace, then gradually slow down at fixed increments; the condition lasted 6 minutes in total. Results showed that as the participant slowed down his <b>finger</b> <b>tapping,</b> his heart rate tended to decrease as well.

50|$|Insensitivity to {{somatosensory}} stimuli, such as heat, cold, touch, and pain, {{are most}} commonly {{a result of}} a more general physical impairment associated with paralysis. Damage to the spinal cord or other major nerve fiber may lead to a termination of both afferent and efferent signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of motor coordination. Other types of somatosensory loss include hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation. Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{tested the}} {{repeatability}} of a <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> device with magnetic sensors {{to determine its}} reliability. This device, which was developed {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and strokes, was used to measure the distance between the thumb and index <b>fingers</b> during <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> movements (repeatedly opening and closing the gap between the thumb and forefinger). We evaluated three types of repeatability based on the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA), i. e., repeatability when movements were measured at different times, that when movements were measured with different devices, and that when movements were measured by different measurers. We analyzed these three types for three <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> tasks on both hands for 21 characteristics calculated from <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> waveforms. As a result, repeatability when using different devices was high regardless of the task or which hand was used. Repeatability when movements were measured at different times and when different measurers were used was high in some tasks, but not all. One of the <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> tasks (<b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> movement with the largest amplitude and highest velocity), which is used in a conventional method of diagnosing PD (UPDRS), did not have sufficient repeatability, while the other tasks exhibited high repeatability.

40|$|Repetitive finger tapping is {{commonly}} used to assess bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. The Queen Square Brain Bank diagnostic criterion of Parkinson's disease defines bradykinesia as 'slowness of initiation with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude of repetitive action'. Although progressive supranuclear palsy is considered an atypical parkinsonian syndrome, {{it is not known}} whether patients with progressive supranuclear palsy have criteria-defined bradykinesia. This study objectively assessed repetitive <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> performance and handwriting in patients with Parkinson's disease (n[*]=[*] 15), progressive supranuclear palsy (n[*]=[*] 9) and healthy age- and gender-matched controls (n[*]=[*] 16). The motion of the hand and digits was recorded in 3 D during 15 -s repetitive index finger-to-thumb tapping trials. The main finding was hypokinesia without decrement in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, which differed from the <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> pattern in Parkinson's disease. Average finger separation amplitude in progressive supranuclear palsy was less than half of that in controls and Parkinson's disease (P[*]<[*] 0. 001 in both cases). Change in tap amplitude over consecutive taps was computed by linear regression. The average amplitude slope in progressive supranuclear palsy was nearly zero (0. 01 °/cycle) indicating a lack of decrement, which differed from the negative slope in patients with Parkinson's disease OFF levodopa (- 0. 20 °/cycle, P[*]=[*] 0. 002). 'Hypokinesia', defined as < 50 % of control group's mean amplitude, combined with 'absence of decrement', defined as mean positive amplitude slope, were identified in 87 % of <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> trials in the progressive supranuclear palsy group and only 12 % in the Parkinson's disease OFF levodopa group. In progressive supranuclear palsy, the mean amplitude was not correlated with disease duration or other clinimetric scores. In Parkinson's disease, <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> pattern was compatible with criteria-defined bradykinesia, characterized by slowness with progressive reduction in amplitude and speed and increased variability in speed throughout the tap trial. In Parkinson's disease, smaller amplitude, slower speed and greater speed variability were all associated with a more severe Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score. Analyses of handwriting showed that micrographia, defined as smaller than 50 % of the control group's mean script size, was present in 75 % of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 15 % of patients with Parkinson's disease (P[*]=[*] 0. 022). Most scripts performed by patients with progressive supranuclear palsy did not exhibit decrements in script size. In conclusion, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy have a specific <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> pattern of 'hypokinesia without decrement' and they do not have criteria-defined limb bradykinesia. Similarly, 'micrographia' and 'lack of decrement in script size' are also more common in progressive supranuclear palsy than in Parkinson's disease...|$|E

The study included 38 sporadic definite-ALS subjects and 70 age-matched control subjects. All received whole-brain MR imaging and spectroscopic imaging scans at 3 T and clinical neurological assessments including percentage maximum forced vital capacity (FVC) and upper motor neuron (UMN) function. Differences in each individual metabolite and its ratio distributions were evaluated in the entire intracranial CST and in five segments {{along the length of the}} CST (at the levels of precentral gyrus (PCG), centrum semiovale (CS), corona radiata (CR), posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) and cerebral peduncle (CP)). Major findings included significantly decreased NAA and increased Cho and Cho/NAA in the entire intracranial CST, with the largest differences for Cho/NAA in all the groups. Significant correlations between Cho/NAA in the entire intracranial CST and the right <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> rate were noted. Of the ten bilateral CST segments, significantly decreased NAA in 4 segments, increased Cho in 5 segments and increased Cho/NAA in all the segments were found. Significant left versus right CST asymmetries were found only in ALS for Cho/NAA in the CS. Among the significant correlations found between Cho/NAA and the clinical assessments included the left-PCG versus FVC and right <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> rate, left -CR versus FVC and right <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> rate, and left PLIC versus FVC and right foot tap rate.

40|$|Abstract. Speech {{production}} {{is part of}} the larger motor control system, and as such can be organized into coordinative structures with other motor behaviors that can then be parameterized as single functional units. Previous work has shown the magnitude of movements in coordinated speech and finger tapping covaries across repetitions. The current study expands on this previous work to examine the temporal coordination of these coordinated movements. Subjects repeated a spoken syllable while tapping their finger in time with their speech. On each trial, they placed an emphatic stress on a single repetition of either a spoken syllable or a <b>finger</b> <b>tap,</b> and were instructed to maintain their production in the other domain unchanged. Results show that explicit stress in either speech or finger tapping generally lengthens the stressed repetition in that domain as well as the synchronous repetition in the other domain. Additionally, stress of either a spoken syllable or <b>finger</b> <b>tap</b> causes some lengthening of the interval between repetitions in both domains. This cross-domain covariation of the interval between repetitions extends to unstressed repetitions as well. These results indicate that control of prosody may be defined over a wide set of articulatory components, not just the speech motor system. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract] Compared to {{isometric}} activities, {{the neural}} basis of fatigue induced by repetitive tasks has been scarcely studied. Recently, {{we showed that}} during short-lasting repetitive tasks at the maximal possible rate (<b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> for 10 and 30 s), tapping rate and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force decrease {{at the end of}} <b>finger</b> <b>tapping.</b> We also observed larger silent periods (SP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during MVC post <b>finger</b> <b>tapping.</b> However, if SP were induced by cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS) they remained unchanged. This suggested a supraspinal origin of fatigue for repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, CMS SP only partially explore spinal excitability; therefore, to evaluate a spinal origin of fatigue it is essential to know the features of the CMS-evoked potentials (CMEP). Herein, we evaluated (n = 15) the amplitude of the CMEP during MVC executed immediately (no gap) after a short-lasting <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> task; we also evaluated the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) so that the amplitude of the CMEP was expressed {{as a function of the}} CMAP amplitude. Indices of fatigue obtained during <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> were compared with those obtained during short-lasting maximal isometric tasks. While indices of excitability increased initially in both tasks, they decreased with the isometric task only when the task was prolonged to 30 s. We suggest that the inability to maintain increased levels of spinal excitability during task execution is a neurophysiological mark of fatigue. Our results suggest that the origin of fatigue induced by brief and fast repetitive tasks is not spinal. Xunta de Galicia; 2007 / 000140 -...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method of {{estimating}} fin-gertip forces in <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> movements based on human fingerpad characteristics. Since the human fingerpad exhibits elasticity, the proposed technique recreates {{the relationship between the}} fingertip force and the displacement generated between the thumb and index fingerpads as a fingerpad-stiffness model. Then, using this model, the force between the two fingertips (the fingertip force) can be estimated from the measured fingerpad deformation only. As the method does not require any sensors to be attached to the finger contact surface to measure fingertip force, {{it can be used to}} evaluate the tendency of force in natural and unconstrained <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> movements conducted by the subject. In the experiments conducted, fingertip forces and the displacement of the two fingerpads generated when the subjects pinched and pushed a force sensor with the thumb and index finger were measured to approximate the relationships between fingerpad force and deformation. The results indicated that human fingerpad characteristics can be expressed using a fingerpad-stiffness function (including an exponential function), and that fingerpad forces can be estimated using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison between a Parkinson’s disease (PD) patient and a healthy subject confirmed differences in the <b>finger</b> <b>tapping</b> forces for each.
