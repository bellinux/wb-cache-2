50|$|The primary {{function}} of a tree is to control the flow, usually oil or gas, out of the well. (A tree may {{also be used to}} control the injection of gas or water into a non-producing well in order to enhance production rates of oil from other wells.) When the well and facilities are ready to produce and receive oil or gas, tree valves are opened and the formation fluids are allowed to go through a flow line. This leads to a processing facility, storage depot and/or other pipeline eventually leading to a refinery or distribution center (for gas). Flow lines on subsea wells usually lead to a fixed or <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> or to a storage ship or barge, known as a floating storage offloading vessel (FSO), or floating processing unit (FPU), or floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO).|$|E

40|$|Offshore risers {{are used}} in the {{exploitation}} of deep-water oil and gas fields, such as those along the Brazilian Southeast coast. They are subjected to severe dynamical loads, such as those related to inside flow of fluids under high pressure, external flow of sea currents and imposed motion by the <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform,</b> due to sea waves. In this paper the non-linear normal modes (NNM´s) of a straight riser subjected to dead weight and sea current are addressed. The NNM´s are useful for the reduced-order modeling of the riser-fluid system, greatly facilitating the forced response analysis under complex dynamic loading, such as that which causes vortex-induced vibration (VIV). NNM´s of straight risers have already been studied in [1], considering it as a continuous beam. Here, a finite-element model will be used instead. A computational tool [2] based on the invariant manifold procedure proposed by Shaw and Pierre [3] has been used to obtain the NNM´s for 2 D frames, using a geometrically non-linear beam theory up to cubic terms [4]. For such systems, the equations of free-vibration motion about the deformed equilibrium configuration are of the form: nsrUpDpM rsrssrs, [...] ., 2, 1, 0, ==++ && &, with njisr pppKppKpKU ppDpDDD ppMpMMM sji ij rssi i rssrsr ji ij rsi i rsrsrs ji ij rsi i rsrsr...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{price and}} demand for natural gas {{has made it possible}} to explore remote gas fields. Traditional offshore <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> for natural gas have been exporting the partially processed natural gas to shore, where it is further processed to permit consumption by end-users. Such an approach is possible where the gas field is located within a reasonable distance from shore or from an existing gas pipeline network. However, much of the world’s gas reserves are found in remote offshore fields where transport via a pipeline is not feasible or is uneconomic to install and therefore, to date, has not been possible to explore. The development of <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> and, on the receiving end, regasification platforms, have increased the possibilities to explore these fields and transport the liquefied gas in a more efficient form, i. e. liquefied natural gas (LNG), to the end user who in turn can readily import the gas. <b>Floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> and regasification platforms, collectively referred to as FLNG, imply a blend of technology from land-based LNG industry, offshore oil and gas industry and marine transport technology. Regulations and rules based on experience from these applications could become too conservative or not conservative enough when applied to a FLNG unit. Alignment with rules for conventional LNG carriers would be an advantage since this would increase the transparency and possibility for standardization in the building of <b>floating</b> LNG <b>production</b> vessels. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the risks relevant to FLNG. The risks are compared to conventional LNG carriers and whether or not regulatory alignment possibilities exist. To identify the risks, a risk analysis was performed based on the principles of formal safety assessment methodology. To propose regulatory alignment possibilities, the risks found were also evaluated against the existing rules and regulations of Det Norske Veritas. The conclusion of the study is that the largest risk-contributing factor on an FLNG is the presence of processing, liquefaction or regasification equipment and for an LNG carrier it is collision, grounding and contact accidents. Experience from oil FPSOs could be used in the design of LNG FPSOs, and attention needs to be drawn to the additional requirements due to processing and storage of cryogenic liquid on board. FSRUs may follow either an approach for offshore rules or, if intended to follow a regular docking scheme, follow an approach for ship rules with additional issues addressed in classification notes...|$|R
40|$|Free Standing Hybrid Riser (FSHR) is an {{innovative}} concept for the riser to transport {{oil and gas}} from the seabed to a <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> deployed in deep water. A FSHR mainly consists of a buoyancy can, a vertical steel riser, a flexible jumper and an upper riser assembly (URA). This study focuses {{on the development of}} the numerical scheme for the dynamic simulation of a FSHR whose flexible jumper is connected to a moored floating production vessel, say floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO). The numerical scheme is mainly based on an existing in-house numerical code, known as COUPLE. In using COUPLE, URA is modeled as a rigid body. The URA connects a vertical steel riser and a flexible jumper, both of which are modeled by beam elements (experienced both tensions and bending moments) in COUPLE. The buoyancy can is connected to the URA through a tether chain, which provides the vertical upright force on the URA and in turn the tension to the vertical riser. The tether chain is modeled by bar elements (experienced only tensions) while the buoyancy can is modeled as a rigid cylinder (beam element). The motions and forces of the two rigid bodies, namely URA and the buoyancy can, are coupled in the simulation. Because the connection between the URA and steel riser is considered as ?rigid?, an accurate numerical scheme modeling a rotational spring connecting the URA and steel riser is developed for calculating the bending moment applied at the upper end of the riser. Given the motion at the upper end of the flexible jumper (connecting to a FPSO), numerical simulations are made for two different FSHRs. The results simulated using COUPLE are in satisfactory agreement with those obtained using OrcaFlex, a commercial code widely used by the offshore industry. Furthermore, the vortex induced motion (VIM) of the buoyancy can is considered in the simulation and its effects on the motion of the FSHR are explored, which is compared with the corresponding model tests. The ability to simulate the dynamics of FSHRs developed in this study may be helpful for the future design of FSHRs...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of petroleum field generates substantial values for Norway. In every development project {{there is always}} “local” and “global” contentment and Norwegian value creation depends on {{the combination of the}} two. Principally, Norwegian value creation is equal to contract value minus the value of imported goods and services for fabrication in Norway and value of Norwegian goods and services used in the fabrication for fabrication outside Norway. In this thesis, Norwegian value creation is defined as a fraction of field development cost that is delivered by Norwegian companies, measured in percentage. Cost estimation is performed using Acona Cost Estimation Software (ACES) software which breakdown field development cost into facilities-based costs and activity-based costs. This thesis estimates and analyzes Norwegian value creation in four different development projects namely Edvard Grieg, Ivar Aasen, Aasta Hansteen, and Gjøa. The four projects are chosen to represent the combination of fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform,</b> dry tree and wet tree (subsea) wells, and local and foreign fabrication of platform. The analysis encompasses analysis of Norwegian value creation in facilities development and well development. Analysis of facilities development comprises 5 main facilities: (1) topside, (2) substructure, (3) subsea system, (4) export pipelines, and (5) power/fiber optic cables, and for every facility 5 main activities are examined: (i) fabrication, (ii) engineering, (iii) procurement, (iv) marine operation, and (v) project management. Analysis of well development covers 2 main activities: drilling service and well completion. The estimation result shows for facilities development Edvard Grieg generates the largest Norwegian value creation among the four projects estimated at 64 % of facilities development cost. Subsequent analysis then shows fabrication and procurement activities of topside account for the biggest development cost in a project. It indicates that location of topside fabrication and origin of goods and services used in topside development have significant effect in increasing Norwegian value creation of a project. For Edvard Grieg case, as both topside and substructure were fabricated in Norway and utilized more Norwegian suppliers in comparison to other projects it generates the highest Norwegian deliveries. This thesis also aims to analyze the competitiveness of local fabrication (i. e. fabrication in Norway) with respect to Norwegian krone exchange rates to US Dollar (NOK/USD). The analysis reveals that competitiveness of local fabrication increases when Norwegian krone depreciates against US Dollar in a long run. As for well development the four projects have comparable Norwegian value creation in a range 55 % - 61 % of respective well development cost. The comparable result is achieved because supply arrangements in drilling activities are practically the same between different projects and eventually similar suppliers are utilized...|$|E
40|$|Due to high {{expectancy}} of hydrocarbon {{resources in the}} Beaufort Sea itis seen as an important area for energy in the future. As the focus nowis shifting towards the deeper parts of the sea, {{there is a need}} for floatingproduction platforms that are able to operate year-round in the harsh con-ditions of the Beaufort Sea. In this Master s thesis the design of such aplatform is performed, with respect to global ice loads acting on the plat-form and the capacity of the stationkeeping system. This is used to analysethe operability of the platform. To be able to develop a <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platform</b> it is crucial to haveinformation on ice conditions in the Beaufort Sea. Literature has been usedto determine ice conditions in the seasonal transitional zone, where it isexpected that the platform will operate. Factors such as level ice, first-year and multi-year ridge dimensions, floe size and ice island mass havebeen defined. These define some of the most common ice conditions in theBeaufort Sea, and as such represent ice conditions a platform can expect tomeet. Functional specifications have been used to determine the most appropriateplatform type. Several platform types were considered based on factorssuch as production and storage, ice loads, and ice interaction with risersand mooring lines. A circular FPSO was selected due to its insensitivity toice drift direction. To reduce ice loading, the platform was designed as adownward sloping cone. Ice loads on the platform have been calculated using several methods com-monly applied in literature. Results show that managed ice yields lowestloads, followed by level ice. Higher loads are seen for ridges, both first-yearand multi-year, and large ice floes. A water depth of 500 m was assumed for the location of the platform. Since this can be considered as a moderate water depth, a conventional mooring system was selected for stationkeeping. The system has 24 mooring lines connected to a buoy, which again connects to the turret on the platform. Internal mooring was seen as necessary to protect mooring lines from ice. Restoring coefficients have been determined using the inelastic catenary equations. Maximum allowable horizontal displacement is defined as 5 % of the water depth. This is used to determine the maximum allowablehorizontal load on the platform to be 53. 38 MN. Lastly, the operability of the platform was judged by comparing various iceloads to the maximum allowable load given by the mooring system. Icemanagement is clearly needed when operating in any ice other than levelice. The requirements of the ice management system has been defined, anda general analysis of the primary and secondary objectives of the ice man-agement system has been performed. It is proposed to use one icebreakerthroughout the year, since the platform may encounter multi-year ice floesduring the summer. As the ice season starts an additional ice breaker isintroduced. In severe ice conditions it may be necessary with a third icebreaker. It is concluded that if proper ice management is ensured, the plat-form should be able to operate year-round...|$|E
40|$|Risers are fluid {{conduits}} from subsea {{equipment to}} surface <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms.</b> The integrity of a riser system plays {{a very important}} role in deepwater developments. A top-tensioned riser generally consists of outer casing, inner casing and tubing. The pipes are coupled either through fluids in the annuli or through intermediate guides (centralizers) or through both. This paper investigates the dynamic analysis for such an internally coupled fluid/ riser system. This paper first presents a theoretical formulation for a general riser system coupled with fluids in the annuli and centralizers between pipes. Hydrodynamic forces associated with the viscous fluid in between concentric cylinders are considered. An effective dynamic stiffness matrix method is then developed to evaluate the added mass and damping influence of the fluid on the natural frequencies and the dynamic response of the coupled riser system. A riser example is used to illustrate the fluid coupling impact on the system’s dynamic performance. The coupling through the fluid and centralizers can be optimally designed such that an inner pipe acts as a vibration absorber to the outer casing. SHEAR 7 JI...|$|R

Riser dynamic analysis is an important part to the system design. This paper investigates riser dynamic analysis using the WKB-Based dynamic stiffness method. This paper first presents a theoretical formulation of the dynamic stiffness method. It then combines the dynamic stiffness method with the WKB theory, which assumes that the coefficients in the differential equation of motion are slowly varying. The WKB-based dynamic stiffness method is derived and a frequency dependent shape function is expressed implicitly. The Wittrick and Williams (W-W) algorithm is further extended to solve eigen value problem for a general non-uniform marine riser. Examples of non-uniform riser are analyzed and the results show the efficiency of this method. In addition, a pipe-in-pipe riser system is analyzed for natural frequencies and mode shapes using the WKB-based dynamic stiffness method with the W-W algorithm. The characteristic of the mode shapes is described for such a riser system. SHEAR 7 JI...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of a mooring line that is connected to a Suezmax vessel is a crucial requirement for our industry. Thus, we should model and analyze such a mooring line under a variety of environmental conditions. The output of modeling and analysis are useful to determine if the given mooring line is suitable for that environment or not. In {{the first part of this}} project a brief description about <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> and mooring systems has been given and different material used for mooring systems has been discussed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of offshore process equipment on <b>floating</b> <b>production</b> <b>platforms</b> {{may be reduced}} through imposed sea motion. Fluid sloshing inside primary separators and non-segregated storage tanks may lead to oil/water mixing. The aim of previous work into sloshing has been to prevent damage to LNG tankers and increase the stability of space rockets. Work into oil/water sloshing appears limited. A computer controlled motion simulator was developed to conduct experiments with two rectangular vessels filled with air, refined oil and water. Two single sinusoidal forcing motions were applied, pitch and surge at various amplitudes and periods. Additional experiments were conducted with combined forcing motions pitch/roll and pitch/surge. Air/water interface profiles were measured and analysed using a computer based data logging and processing system. Air/oil and oil/water profiles were recorded using high speed video equipment. Also studied were the effect of baffles in reducing interface amplitude {{and the effect of}} forcing on oil/water transfer. A linear theory was derived to predict natural frequencies of three fluid systems and a numerical model was developed to predict near resonant behaviour. Air/water experiments and numerical model showed a coupling of natural and forcing frequencies in the free surface frequency spectrum. Favourable comparisons were also seen between the numerical model and oil/water experiments. Additional experiments indicated that oil/water mixing is promoted by resonant forcing in an unbaffled vessel. The presence of baffles reduces interfacial breakup and hence reduces oil content of water. SERCThe Marine Technology DirectorateBritoi...|$|R
