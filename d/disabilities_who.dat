50|$|Generally, {{people with}} <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> were {{employed}} {{were more likely}} than people without disability to work part-time (38% and 31% respectively). The number of hours usually worked by people with disability was associated with the severity and type of disability they had. People with profound or severe <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> worked were more likely to work part-time hours than those with less severe disability. Nevertheless, almost half (49%) of those with profound or severe <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> were working, worked full-time. Among the five disability groups, psychological and intellectual disabilities have greater association with fewer working hours. More than a third (35%) of people with psychological <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> worked, usually worked no more than 15 hours, followed by people with intellectual disability (30%).

40|$|The Australian Human Rights Commission is {{concerned}} that many people with <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> need communication supports or who have complex and multiple support needs are not having their rights protected, and are not being treated equally, {{in the criminal justice}} system.

It is happening to people with <b>disability</b> <b>who</b> are victims of crime, accused of crimes, witnesses, defendants and offenders.

It summarises the main issues under each barrier and includes some real stories as examples. It also includes some questions about the criminal justice system and your experiences.

Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E
