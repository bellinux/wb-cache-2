40|$|List in December 2000, {{and is one}} of {{the largest}} karst areas in Asia and the world. This {{spectacular}} region is home to a large tract of protected tropical rainforest and has biodiversity values of global significance. Its landscape and cave systems contain several areas of exceptional natural beauty, and its caves are some of the most extensive and largest in the world. It is fitting that the Asia-Pacific Forum on Karst Ecosystems and World Heritage took place at such a magnificent location, and is a marvellous example of why the special values of karst should be protected on the World Heritage List. The UNESCO World Heritage Centre is keen to support activities and initiatives that enable identification and nomination of categories of sites that are currently underrepresented on the World Heritage list. Only 138 of the 690 sites on the World Heritage list are protected for their natural values; 60 - 70 % of them are protected for their biodiversity values. The World <b>Heritage</b> <b>Forests</b> Conference, in Berastagi, Indonesia in December 1998 was an important meeting in dealing with thematic World Heritage issues related to biodiversity conservation. The Asia-Pacific Forum on Karst and World Heritage is another important step in recognising and protecting the unique values o...|$|E

The display of existing spatial phenomena is executed by regulations stipulated by The spatial planning law from 2007, and detailed by Rules on the display of existing spatial phenomena from 2008 (hereinafter the Rules). The thesis consists of the theoretical and the practical part. The legal basis is presented in the first part, continued by an example of the display of existing spatial phenomena for the settlement of Sorica (both Zgornja and Spodnja Sorica). After that Sorica and its municipality Železniki are presented. The display of existing spatial phenomena is composed of textual and graphical part. In the textual part there is mostly the town description and the interpretation of the graphical charts, in the graphical part there is a display of the discussed area, a display of the intended as well as the actual land use including restrictions and protection regimes like cultural <b>heritage,</b> <b>forests,</b> waters, natural values, etc. Graphical attachments are in the 1 : 25. 000 scale, which allows the display of the whole discussed area to be put on a A 3 -sized paper. But according to the Rules it is necessary to make the display of existing spatial phenomena in the scale of 1 : 5. 000 or less, that is why we created displays for a part of the settlement in the regulated scale. In the final part we have summed up our findings about the display of existing spatial phenomena and discussed about its usefulness in spatial planning. ...|$|E
