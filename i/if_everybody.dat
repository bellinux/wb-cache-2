500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. <b>If</b> <b>everybody</b> hates it, OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
2500|$|RZA went on {{to comment}} about the collaboration, saying [...] "Biggie was always pretty cool with me. He liked the Wu-Tang sound. He {{requested}} me {{to be on the}} album. I didn’t know <b>if</b> <b>everybody</b> in his camp agreed with it...but we was always cool with each other...at the end he’s talking about everybody was fucking with them at that time. He could have even been talking about me , ’cause there was some cuts at Biggie on the Cuban Linx... album" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the album's {{production}} and style, Harrell stated that {{artists such as}} Rihanna have been talking a stance and stepping away from the popular music {{of the time and}} the expectations of her label, directors and radio, stating, [...] "I don't want to make what everybody else is making. I want to make what I want to make. I know my fans will love it because my fans are loyal to me, but <b>if</b> <b>everybody</b> else loves it, great. If they don't, at least I know, as an artist, I've done what I want to do." [...] Anti was engineered by Nathaniel Alford, Chris Godbey, Harrell, Blake Mares, Daniela Rivera and Marcos Tovar and Harrell. The album was finally mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound, in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|In a new {{interview}} with Songfacts in 2015, Gray said that Mudvayne's return seemed unlikely: [...] "I don’t {{know if the}} full band will [...] Who knows — they might be putting something else together. We were talking {{for a while and}} that whole thing with Greg [...] went down and everything kind of fell apart. Our relationship, which was the only truly solid relationship in the group, although Matt [...] and I are still great, Ryan [...] and I still briefly talk. I mean, the only way I personally would want to do Mudvayne is <b>if</b> <b>everybody</b> licked their wounds and got over it. There's {{a lot of things in}} that band that tore us apart. Maybe Mudvayne was the martyr for people that stopped supporting music. You sell 159,000 records the first week, and then the next record is like, 'Whatever, f--k it.' Maybe it's a subliminal message if you don't support things... Mudvayne's probably bigger now than it ever was. So, people want what they can't have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the {{industrial}} revolution, English courts {{became more and}} more wedded to the concept of [...] "freedom of contract". It was partly a sign of progress, as the vestiges of feudal and mercantile restrictions on workers and businesses were lifted, a move of people (at least in theory) from [...] "status to contract". On the other hand, a preference for laissez faire thought concealed the inequality of bargaining power in multiple contracts, particularly for employment, consumer goods and services, and tenancies. At the centre of the general law of contracts, captured in nursery rhymes like Robert Browning's Pied Piper of Hamelin in 1842, was the fabled notion that if people had promised something [...] "let us keep our promise". But then, the law purported to cover every form of agreement, as <b>if</b> <b>everybody</b> had the same degree of free will to promise what they wanted. Though many of the most influential liberal thinkers, especially John Stuart Mill, believed in multiple exceptions to the rule that laissez faire was the best policy, the courts were suspicious of interfering in agreements, whoever the parties were. In Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson Sir George Jessel MR proclaimed it a [...] "public policy" [...] that [...] "contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by Courts of justice." [...] The same year, the Judicature Act 1875 merged the Courts of Chancery and common law, with equitable principles (such as estoppel, undue influence, rescission for misrepresentation and fiduciary duties or disclosure requirements in some transactions) always taking precedence.|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} area in which common knowledge problems arise is {{in the study of}} rational expectations equilibria in the trading of risky securities. How can there be trade <b>if</b> <b>everybody's</b> willingness to trade means that everybody knows that everybody expects to be a winner? (see Milgrom/Stokey [1982] and Geanakoplos [1988].) Since risky securities are traded on the basis of private information, there must presumably be some "agreeing to disagree" in the real world. But to assess its extent and its implications, one needs to have a precise theory of the norm from wich "agreeing to disagree" is seen as a deviation. The beginnings of such a theory are presented here. Some formalism is necessary in such a presentation because the English language is not geared up to express the appropriate ideas compactly. Without some formalism, it is therefore very easy to get confused. However, nothing requiring any mathematical expertise is to be described...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{attributable}} {{fraction of a}} disease due to an exposure is the fraction of disease cases in a population that {{can be attributed to}} that exposure. We consider the {{attributable fraction}} for a semicontinuous exposure, that is an exposure for which a clump of people have zero exposure {{and the rest of the}} people have a continuously distributed positive exposure. Estimation of the attributable fraction involves estimating the conditional probability of having the disease given the exposure. Three main approaches to estimating the probability function are (1) a classical method based on sample averages; (2) parametric regression methods such as logistic regression models and power models; and (3) nonparametric regression methods including local linear smoothing and isotonic regression. We compare performance of these methods in estimating the attributable fraction for a semi-continuous exposure in a simulation The attributable fraction of a disease due to an exposure is the proportion of disease cases which would be eliminated <b>if</b> <b>everybody’s</b> exposure was set to zero. The AF is an important measure of the public health impact of the exposure on disease burde...|$|R
