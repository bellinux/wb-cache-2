40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} occuring artifacts in ultrasound imaging is reverberations. These are multiple reflection echoes that result in <b>ghost</b> <b>echoes</b> in the ultrasound image. A method for reducing these unwanted artifacts using a three-dimensional (3 D) Wiener filter is presented. The Wiener filter is a global filter and produces an estimate of the uncorrupted signal by minimizing the mean square error between the estimate and the uncorrupted signal in a statistical sense. The procedure works as follows: In a graphic interface the operator is displayed an image sequence. The operator marks two areas in one of the images; one area which contains a typical reverberation artifact, and one area free from artifact. Using these areas to produce noise and signal estimates, a Wiener filter is created and applied to the sequence. The 3 D Wiener filters display excellent selection capabilities, and the developed method significantly reduces the magnitude of the reverberation artifact in the tested sequences. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{artifacts}} in ultrasound imaging is reverberations. These are multiple reflection echoes that register as coming from a deeper region than the depth of the interface that are causing them, and result in <b>ghost</b> <b>echoes</b> in the ultrasound image. A method to reduce these unwanted artifacts using a three dimensional (2 D + time) Wiener filter has been developed. Two sequences of iq-data, the least processed signal possible to retrieve from the ultrasound system (Vingmed System Five), have been used to test the method: One sequence on a tissue-mimicking agar gel phantom in which bars of glass simulating ribs give rise to reverberations, and one sequence on an open-chest pig with a strong reverberation from a water-filled rubber glove used as a medium between the heart and the transducer. The procedure works as follows: In a graphic interface the operator is shown the image sequence. In one of the frames two areas must be marked out; One area which contains a typical reverberation artifact, and one area which will represent an artifact free signal. After creating the three dimensional Wiener filter post-processing of the sequence is performed. The developed method significantly reduced the magnitude of the reverberation artifact in the tested sequences. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ultrasonic}} {{inspection of the}} primary coolant piping of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) is a major concernfor the nuclear industry. Numerous studies have been undertaken over some years by EDF R&D in collaborationwith the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) to improve the non-destructive testing (NDT) process for these applications and to help towards their qualifi cation. More particularly, {{a great deal of}} workwas carried out on the inspection of austenitic stainless steel welds. Indeed, the anisotropic, heterogeneousand coarse granular structures of these welds lead to important disturbances of the ultrasonic propagation:beam skewing and splitting, attenuation, backscattering and <b>ghost</b> <b>echoes.</b> This paper presents the methodologydeveloped for modelling the {{ultrasonic inspection}} of austenitic welds, which is based on an accuratecharacterization of the material. Two numerical approaches are presented: a fi nite elements code, ATHENA,developed by EDF, and a semi-analytical code that {{is a part of the}} CIVA simulation platform developed by theCEA. These codes simulate the propagation of the ultrasonic beam in the weld and calculate the defect-beaminteraction. Ultrasonic beam disturbances are illustrated from experimental and numerical results for differentapplications. In particular, the infl uence of variations in the weld structure on NDT performance is discussed. This comparison between experiment and modelling shows the modelling methodology to be valid...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was performed to}} aid the terrestrial archaeological investigation of a Roman fort found above the Cornish town of Calstock. Due {{to the location of}} the fort it seems likely that a river crossing would be located in the area. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the bottom environments of an area of the upper reaches of the Tamar Estuary and the sediment dynamics of an intertidal mud flat to evidence the location of the river crossing. A three pronged approach was employed. To investigate the bottom environments a geophysical survey of the river was completed; this consisted of a side-scan sonar survey and sub-bottom profiler survey. The sediment dynamics of an intertidal mud flat were explored using a dual tag signature sediment tracer. A silt tracer was used to investigate suspended load transport and a sand tracer was used to investigate bed load transport. The sub-bottom profiler provided data on the bed composition and underlying strata of the river bottom and the side-scan sonar produced images of the river bed. The suspended sediment experiment used rare earth magnets placed in the mud flat to provide data on the direction of movement and the height above the bed that the suspended particles are transported within the water column. The bed sediment experiment used direct field measurement techniques to investigate bed load transport particularly focusing on the direction of movement of the sand tracer particles and burial/erosion regimes on the intertidal mud flat. The results suggest that the Tamar Estuary is a flood dominant estuary. Within the survey area there is a significant mobile fluid mud layer. This is transporting a large amount of suspended particles on a spring tide and creating significant deposition of suspended sediment on a neap tide. The fluid mud layer also caused <b>ghost</b> <b>echoes</b> to appear on the data generated by the sub bottom profiler survey. The study separates transport and deposition effects and informs sediment movement predictions throughout the tidal cycle. The sediment particle tracer used in the study provided a practical tool capable of directly highlighting sediment transport pathways. The study has highlighted the benefits of using an integrated approach towards sediment investigations, and provides information about the river which assists the terrestrial archaeological investigation. The study, although restricted to a small survey area, has provided data which has enabled robust and evidenced conclusions to be drawn which supports the findings of other authors in this field. Findings from this study alongside evidence from other authors and researchers strengthen and extend our knowledge and understanding of the sediment dynamics within the Tamar estuary...|$|R
40|$|Evidence of multiple-scattering-induced pulse {{stretching}} for {{the signal}} of both frequencies of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory satellite is presented {{on the basis}} of collocated ground-based WSR- 88 D S-band observations of an extreme case: a tornadic supercell. The ground-based observations clearly show a tilted convective core with a so-called bounded weak-echo region-that is, locations where precipitation is absent or extremely light at the ground while large amounts of liquid or frozen precipitation are present aloft. The satellite observations in this region show reflectivity profiles that extend {{all the way to the}} surface despite the absence of near-surface precipitation: these are here referred to as "ghost echoes. " Furthermore, the Ku- and Ka-band profiles exhibit similar slopes, which is a typical sign that the observed power is almost entirely due to multiple scattering. A novel microphysical retrieval that is based on triple-frequency (S-Ku-Ka) observations shows that a dense ice core located between 4 and 14 km with particle sizes exceeding 2. 5 cm and integrated ice contents exceeding 7. 0 kg m- 2 is the source of the <b>ghost</b> <b>echoes</b> of the signal in the lower layers. The level of confidence of this assessment is strengthened by the availability of the S-band data, which provide the necessary additional constraints to the radar retrieval that is based on DPR data. This study shows not only that multiple-scattering contributions may become predominant at Ka already very high up in the atmosphere but also that they play a key role at Ku band within the layers close to the surface. As a result, extreme caution must be paid even in the interpretation of Ku-based retrievals (e. g., the TRMM PR dataset or any DPR retrievals that are based on the assumption that Ku band is not affected by multiple scattering) when examining extreme surface rain rates that occur in the presence of deep dense ice layers.

500|$|Cross {{wanted to}} write [...] "a really old-fashioned scary episode of Doctor Who" [...] {{targeted}} especially at children nine to twelve, which was how he remembered Doctor Who at that age. He stated that [...] "time travel and <b>ghosts</b> are <b>echoes</b> of one another. What is a ghost, if not a fragment caught in time?" [...] He aimed to show suspense and tension, as {{he felt it was}} more terrifying than [...] "full-on shock horror blood and gore". Cross was inspired by The Quatermass Experiment and its sequels, and originally intended to have the Doctor meet Bernard Quatermass, though this was not possible, for copyright reasons. Cross was also inspired by Quatermass writer Nigel Kneale's The Stone Tape, which was why he set the story in the 1970s. [...] "Hide" [...] was intended to be a [...] "very small, very restricted ghost story", but he was asked to make it bigger in the end. The different universe was present, but it was [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] and the climax originally took place in the house, just in daylight and in the alternate world. The idea of the Crooked Man was something Cross said lurked in his imagination. The love story twist was added in later, because Moffat felt the monster should be more fleshed out, and Cross chose to mirror the love plot between Emma and the Professor.|$|R

DOI: 10. 1109 /MWSCAS. 2009. 5235936 A video ghost canceller, which reduces the effect of multi-path signal <b>echoes</b> (<b>ghosts),</b> is described in this paper. An adaptive LMS algorithm was used to improve the received image quality of PAL or NTSC broadcasts. The internal 576 -tap digital filter, which is comprised of a 144 -tap FIR and a 430 -tap IIR filter, cancels ghosts occurring from - 6. 15 muS before to + 41. 6 muS after the main signal. In order to reduce the chip area occupied by the filter, an algorithm that combines the error threshold and the error accumulation methods is applied for reducing the coefficients word-length. Also, a tap-decimated equalizer is proposed, which can greatly reduce the number of the multipliers in the adaptive filter. The system on chip (SoC) device performs all the functions required for ghost cancellation, eliminating the need for external DSP controllers, memory, sync detection, D/A converters, A/D converters, and user programming. From chip tests, the canceller can remove the ghost whose power is lower than - 6 dB compared to that of the main signal and make ghost residue down to - 40 dB. When operating at a rate of 14. 318 MHz (4 Fsc), it dissipates 1. 3 W from a 3. 3 V power supply...|$|R

50|$|The Victoria & Albert Museum {{commissioned}} Collishaw with {{a monumental}} onsite project, Magic Lantern, which - {{installed in the}} cupola above the entrance - appropriated {{the architecture of the}} V&A creating a beacon of light, complete with an attendant swarm of moths, and was visible across London during the winter months of 2010 - 2011.This is not an exit, 2013 at Blain|Southern Gallery, London, saw Collishaw return to medium of oil painting. However, as is usual with his practice, nothing is literal; the primary source material - magnified images drawn from the pages of glossy magazines - is a simple metaphor, one part of a prism conceived to examine moral questions provoked by the excessive binge culture that preceded the global financial crisis. When seen from a distance, these large-scale works appear to be abstract paintings constructed on a classic modernist grid; closer inspection reveals them to be scraps of advertisements for luxury goods culled from ‘lifestyle’ magazines like Tatler and Vogue. But this is only partially the case; they are in fact facsimiles of the precisely folded, origami-like ‘wraps’ used by drug dealers to package cocaine, complete with powdery traces of the narcotic.In 2014 Collishaw held a solo exhibition at Galleria Borghese, Rome, titled Black Mirror whereby he responded to the works in the Borghese collection. Three paintings by Caravaggio (Madonna and Child with St. Anne - Dei Palafrenieri, David with the Head of Goliath, Saint Jerome Writing) appear and disappear behind the surfaces of large mirrors framed in black Murano glass. The figures are animated to appear as though posing for the painting; breathing, blinking and shifting their weight in front of us. Everyday people caught {{in the process of being}} transformed into religious icons, trapped like spectres in an indeterminate space between the real world and the realm of the painting. The Massacre of the Innocents by Ippolito Scarsella was referenced by a fourth work on the ground floor of the museum. Featuring over 300 characters, the Biblical tale of genocide is re-enacted in All things Fall, as a cornucopia of savagery comes to life in a heaving mass of kaleidoscopic brutality - forever trapped in a frenzied purgatory of interminable violence.Collishaw held a major retrospective at New Art Gallery Walsall, in 2015. The exhibition included photography, film, sculpture and installation and testified to the richness and breadth of Collishaw’s practice, highlighting and exploring some of the overriding themes and preoccupations within his work. Works from 1996 through to 2015 were presented over two floors, including his ambitious installation, Deliverance (2008), repeated projections onto walls coated in phosphorescent paint present ghostly figures that appear suddenly and then slowly fade, only to be replaced by another. Drawing on the news coverage of the 2004 Beslan siege, Collishaw makes reference to the seemingly insatiable appetite of the press for images of disaster and trauma and of the complex and often ambivalent ways in which we as viewers respond to these distressing scenes. The exhibition included works from the photographic series’ Single Nights (2007), Insecticides(2006-ongoing) and Catching Fairies (1996) as well as the sculptural series The Venal Muse (2012-15) in which brightly coloured flowers, presented in vitrines, reveal on close inspection evidence of disease and decay. New Art Gallery Walsall also staged the UK premier of Collishaw’s acclaimed zoetrope, All Things Fall.Concurrent to the exhibition at Walsall, Collishaw presented In Camera, a work commissioned by GRAIN and The Library of Birmingham, inspired by the Library’s internationally renowned photography collection.In 2016, Collishaw created two striking new installations for the follies in the 18th century landscape surrounding Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal - a National Trust World Heritage Site in Yorkshire, UK. A co-commission between the Trust and Blain|Southern, the works drew upon the history of the buildings and are optical illusions that <b>echo</b> <b>ghosts</b> of the past. The Banqueting House became the site for a major new 3D zoetrope titled Seria Ludo. The work is a glowing, strobe lit chandelier, covered with 186 carousing Lilliputian figures. As it spins, the zoetrope animates the tableaux, bringing scenes of drunken revelry to life as characters - including a swinging monkey - eat, drink, fight and dance. In contrast, the Temple of Piety - serenely stationed at the edge of the garden’s Moon Ponds, is the setting for a work that is more tranquil, The Pineal Eye sees two parabolic mirrors face each other. The resulting optical effect creates an ethereal mirage of the Roman depiction of piety, the Grecian daughter feeding her imprisoned father from her breast, which also appears as a relief on the back wall of the Temple. In addition to the pictorial beauty offered by the water gardens, they also function as hydraulic balancing systems for the river Skell that flows through Fountains Abbey. Illustrating this form of release was one of Collishaw's main objectives when creating Seria Ludo and The Pineal Eye, two works which illustrate an explosion of tension, with themes that plumb into the follies' principles of pleasure and piety.|$|R
