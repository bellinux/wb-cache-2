50|$|Glaze or glaze ice, {{also called}} <b>glazed</b> <b>frost,</b> is a smooth, {{transparent}} and homogeneous ice coating occurring when freezing rain or drizzle hits a surface. It {{is similar in}} appearance to clear ice, which forms from supercooled water droplets. It is a relatively common occurrence in temperate climates in the winter when precipitation forms in warm air aloft and falls into below-freezing temperature at the surface.|$|E

Exclusion of <b>glazed</b> <b>frost</b> formation can be only achieved on the basis of slipperiness forecasting. Winter slipperiness forecasting is rather complicated problem due to a lot of influencing factors and their non- deterministic character. Various types of winter slipperiness and specific forecasting features of this phenomenon are thoroughly considered in the paper. Forecasting methods for some highways and their sections are mainly statistical at the present moment. They are based on processing of a great number of empiric data. The paper proposes an empiric model for forecasting temperature pavement according to ambient temperature, humidity, wind direction and presence of vegetation along a highway. The obtained model can be used to forecast slipperiness formation during winter highway operation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fog, <b>glazed</b> <b>frost,</b> hail, blizzards, {{snow cover}} and strong winds are {{recognized}} {{as some of the}} most representative climate hazards impacting transport systems. The authors computed several climate indicators based on their cumulated frequency (average annual number of days) in order to highlight the most significant hazardous phenomena using the climate database (1961 - 2010) of the most relevant weather stations in Dolj County and its surroundings. The indicators were computed and integrated in GIS using spatial analysis techniques resulting the regionalization of extreme weather phenomena. Also, ranking the analysed phenomena according to their importance in impacting the transport systems, a multiple climate hazard (MCH) map have resulted. The derived values were classified into three intervals corresponding to three intensity classes: high, medium and low. In order to spatially quantify the MCH, the share of each intensity class at administrative-territorial units (LAU 2) was calculated...|$|E

40|$|Formation, adhesion, and {{accumulation}} of ice, snow, <b>frost,</b> <b>glaze,</b> rime, or their mixtures can cause severe problems for solar panels, wind turbines, aircrafts, heat pumps, power lines, telecommunication equipment, and submarines. These problems can decrease efficiency in power generation, increase energy consumption, result in mechanical and/or electrical failure, and generate safety hazards. To address these issues, {{the fundamentals of}} interfaces between liquids and surfaces at low temperatures have been extensively studied. This has lead to development of so called “icephobic” surfaces, which possess a number of overlapping, yet distinctive, characteristics from superhydrophobic surfaces. Less {{attention has been given}} to distinguishing differences between formation and adhesion of ice, snow, <b>glaze,</b> rime, and <b>frost</b> or to developing a clear definition for icephobic, or more correctly pagophobic, surfaces. In this review, we strive to clarify these differences and distinctions, while providing a comprehensive definition of icephobicity. We classify different canonical families of icephobic (pagophobic) surfaces providing a review of those with potential for scalable and robust development.

40|$|Offshore oil {{exploration}} and production operators in high latitude regions recognize icing as a seasonal challenge. Icing is often accepted as an inconvenience, but that tolerance can rapidly become a safety hazard that requires solutions. This report evaluates the superstructure and atmospheric icing hazard on offshore platforms and supply boats with location and operation on the structure. It also explains {{the potential impact of}} icing on these locations and operations by icing type: sea spray, snow, <b>glaze,</b> rime, <b>frost,</b> and sleet. Fourteen ice protection technology categories are identified for anti-icing, deicing, and ice detection. These technologies include chemicals, icephobic coatings, structure design, expulsive techniques, heat, high-volume water, air and steam, infrared energy, manual deicing, piezoelectric methods, pneumatic boots, vibration and covers, and as separate categories windows, cables, and ice detection methods. Each technology category is described with regard to products available, current use, engineering design, technology readiness levels, capability at the current level of development for the marine environment, possible use in the marine environment to improve safety, and indications of development necessary to transfer the technology to offshore use. Examples of technology sources are also provided. Suggestions are made with regard to the application of technologies to solve icing safety threats on platforms and supply boats. Technology readiness levels are also summarized. The goal is to provide a technology resource for offshore oil and production operators with icing-related safety requirements...|$|R
40|$|This {{semester}} my {{design is}} of a Library in Amsterdam, located opposite the Niewe Kirk or new church, I chose {{to make the}} building a contemporary design rather than attempting to mimic the historical buildings surrounding it. I used the materials of the building, predominantly brick, to tie it to its context rather than form. The street facing facades are concaved in order to draw passers by into the building, and individualise the library from the traditional row housing. The upper level is trussed to give the library a modern look while providing clear views to the Niewe Kirk and Magna Plaza. It incudes large amounts of <b>glazing,</b> which is <b>frosted</b> in key areas to provide some privacy while maximising the interior lighting in the dull Dutch climate. The triangular atrium carries down through all the levels to the lobby and parallels the overall shape of the building. The form of the library is strongly based on the theories and works of Louis Khan, one of my favourite architects, and a person who I had chosen to study during the mid year break. I purposely went about putting Khans philosophy into practice, but now realise that {{this may have been}} a mistake so early on in my studies. I became too fixated on his ideas, and the resulting concept designs were in many ways too derivative of Khans work. Therefore I spent much of the semester trying to create an individual identity for my building rather than progressing in the outlined stages. Although I was pleased with the final design of the library, I think there are still many issues that need to be resolved. I also think that, like many of my tutorial group, the building relates well to its context, however this could be at the expense of being too conservative. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to find definitive evidence for impact in the geological record because there are many endogenous geological processes that can produce diamictites similar to those generated by impact ejecta. The classic impact criteria of shock fabrics in certain minerals, and iridium layers, for example, may be either difficult to find, or long-since erased from the impact site (shock fabrics also anneal with time). It is important to be able to recognize impact-generated materials in order to understand earth's crustal development and biological evolution. In future exploration of Mars and other solar-system bodies, recognition of impact materials will be important for elucidating planetary evolution, planetary volatile inventories, and exobiological issues. The cobble depicted is typical of many that have been found in diamictite deposits in Belize generated by the Chicxulub K-T impact event. The pebbles are roughly-hewn in general shape with smoothed corners and edges. Surfaces are almost uniformly frosted (on both protuberances and hollows), but some asperities are glazed. Optical microscopy and thin-section petrographic microscopy reveal the frosting to be only a few microns thick, with a well-defined granular structure; grains are the same size as those composing the bulk of the limestone, but their clearer appearance may represent annealing. One or two adjacent pebble faces are often decorated with striated gouges and closely-spaced hemispherical depressions representing indentation hollows produced by well-rounded impacting clasts of up to 0. 5 cm in diameter. Some of the impactors are still embedded in the cobble surface. Non-destructive x-ray diffraction techniques showed the impactors to be of the same mineralogy as the target cobble. We believe this unusual <b>glazing</b> and <b>frosting</b> {{to be related to the}} impact event, but this must be reconciled with its survival for over 60 my. since it is composed of one of the most alterable substances, CaCO 3. We focus, however, on the non-fractured rounded pebbles that appear to have impacted the larger cobble as a swarm of clasts, probably encountered during ballistic flight. It cannot be defined whether the cobble swept through the pebble cloud, or the pebbles rained upon a slowermoving cobble. Two interesting questions arise: (1) Where did large numbers of such well rounded pebbles come from in the ejecta curtain?, and (2) How did they embed themselves in a nominally brittle rock without suffering damage? Are the well-rounded pebbles crystalline (devitrified) melt spherules? Further investigations are in progress. If the cobble was cold and brittle, impact of well-rounded pebbles would have produced Hertzian fracture patterns (a) in the virtually elastically isotropic cobble target. For penetration depths of about 0. 5 of the impactor diameter, the pebbles would require a relative impact velocity sufficient to cause pebble fragmentation and crushing, and the development of a complex Hertzian-Boussinesq fracture field (b) involving deep fracturing and lateral surface spalling (impact velocities > 50 m/s). The existing relationship could only evolve by the impact of cold, hard pebbles into a soft, plastic cobble surface (c). For limestone to have been plastic, it must have been at elevated temperature, but to prevent calcification of the material, the ambient pressure must also have been elevated. This would be possible either in the impact's gas plume, or within the confines of a thin aerodynamically-produced shock bow generated by supersonic ballistic motion of the cobble. In the latter case, it is implied that the cobble swept through the pebbles rather than vice-versa. Although there are high T-P conditions associated with volcanism, such textures have not been reported on volcaniclastic materials, nor from other high T-P environments; e. g., metamorphic (as far as the authors are aware). We propose that this very easily recognizable embedding and indentation surface texture can be used as a diagnostic criterion for the recognition of impact ejecta. The term "peening texture" is suggested, because it is absolutely analogous to the plastic-deformation induced, metal-surface textures generated by ball-bearing bombardment used in engineering metallurgy to work-harden metal surfaces.
