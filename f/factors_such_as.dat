5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{cardiovascular}} risk <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, {{are associated}} with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, statins, which are cholesterol lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{proposed}} relationships between certain modifiable <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors {{can help to}} prevent AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{average age}} of {{menarche}} is approximately 12.5 years in the United States, 12.7 in Canada, 12.9 in the UK and 13.1 years in Iceland. <b>Factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> genetics, diet and overall health can affect timing.|$|E
5|$|The {{pale blue}} {{color of the}} dot {{is the result of}} {{polarization}} and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.|$|E

5|$|The {{variability}} in tolerance and other variable <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> workload {{have resulted in}} the U.S. Navy abandoning screening for oxygen tolerance. Of the 6,250 oxygen-tolerance tests performed between 1976 and 1997, only 6 episodes of oxygen toxicity were observed (0.1%).|$|E
5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E

5|$|Biofuels, in {{the form}} of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are {{entering}} the market, driven by <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security.

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.
