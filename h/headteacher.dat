40|$|In Scottish education, school {{leadership}} {{is regarded as}} central in realising the policy ambitions to raise attainment. This article examines critically the policy expectations and demands made on <b>headteachers.</b> These expectations are set out in successive sets of a professional standard – the Standard for Headship – particularly the codification of the key purpose of headship. These expectations are interrogated first through a textual analysis to identify codes of meaning, and second through interview data relating to the lived experiences of <b>headteachers.</b> These data were collected {{as part of a}} larger study and the issues explored included the range of tasks the <b>headteachers</b> undertake routinely, their motivations and experiences of the role and the means of coping with demands. The discussion highlights some of the tensions experienced by <b>headteachers</b> as they work to meet expectations. From this investigation, it is clear that the codified expectations placed on <b>headteachers</b> relating to learning and to leading people chimes with the headteachers’ aspirations for their role. However, operational matters and administrative demands dominate the day-to-day work of <b>headteachers.</b> The article concludes by identifying some critical issues for the preparation of <b>headteachers...</b>|$|R

The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been in existence for more than 35 years. The band was started by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened in Basingstoke in 1975 {{where he was the}} first <b>headteacher.</b> Lawrie formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band. In the years immediately after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a <b>headteacher</b> and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the challenges for Junior Secondary School <b>headteachers</b> (both male and female) in the Sunyani municipality of Ghana and their professional development needs. Ghana is a developing country in West Africa facing the challenge of improving educational provision at different levels. This was a qualitative study underpinned by interpretive philosophical thought. It employed a case study approach and collected data in two phases using semi-structured questionnaire and semi-structured interview. In the first phase, a questionnaire was distributed to all <b>headteachers</b> and Circuit Supervisors (school inspectors) in the municipality, while the second phase involved semi-structured interviews with a purposive maximum variation sample of <b>headteachers</b> and Circuit Supervisors who had already responded to the questionnaire. The study highlighted that the <b>headteachers</b> faced multiple challenges. These included teachers’ lack of commitment and uncooperative attitude; non-involvement of the <b>headteachers</b> in making decisions that affected their professional practice; the complexity and multiplicity of their roles and responsibilities; and insignificant responsibility allowances. The study identified the factors responsible for these problems. The study also identified ways of preparing aspiring <b>headteachers</b> for meeting the demands in the educational context. Specifically, it identified the skills and competences they required and the training opportunities {{for the provision of}} those competences as well as strategies for meaningful selection/ appointment of <b>headteachers</b> and their induction. The findings suggested that the in-service training /continuing professional development programmes organised in Sunyani municipality for practising <b>headteachers</b> were inappropriate for enhancing their professional growth and development. The study proposed ways/strategies for improving some aspects of the programmes for meaningful professional development of the <b>headteachers.</b> This research also unveiled additional in-service training/continuing professional development opportunities for the <b>headteachers</b> in that context, including regional-based courses and a cluster-based collaborative headship scheme.

Evidence was collected from a postal survey of 100 <b>headteachers</b> and interviews in nine case study schools. The aim is twofold: first, to provide a 'snapshot' of the <b>headteachers,</b> their qualifications, routes to headship and career aspirations; and second, to highlight the ways in which these have changed in the intervening 10 years since the original research was reported. By way of a conclusion, the article poses the question: Are small-school <b>headteachers</b> still a match for the job...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} enquiry {{examines the}} extent to which managerialism has permeated the headship role in England. It analyses the literature pertaining to the changing role of headship in England, managerialism, the marketization of education and the impact that these elements have had on the headship role in England, as well as {{the manner in which they}} have impacted upon schools in general. The study also explored England’s National College for School Leadership, its headship standards and its generic headship training. The research was conducted by way of semi-structured interviews with six <b>headteachers,</b> two of whom were new to headship, two of whom had more than five years of experience and two of whom were retired. The sample included a mix of state school and independent school <b>headteachers.</b> The data revealed a stark contrast between the professional experiences of state school <b>headteachers</b> and independent school <b>headteachers.</b> The state school <b>headteachers</b> cited pressures of governmental interference and also noted the pressures posed by the socioeconomic background of the given school’s intake. The <b>headteachers</b> also expressed feeling insecure from one day to the next and there was an overriding sense of confusion predominantly due to constant changes in government directives. By contrast, any impact on the independent school <b>headteachers</b> from government intervention and interference was demonstrably absent...|$|R

By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the <b>headteacher</b> later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|The {{headmaster}} is {{a member}} of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and is responsible to the governors for the whole school from 7 to 18, though is primarily based in the Senior School. Housemasters are managed by the principal deputy head, who is accountable to the <b>headteacher</b> for the pastoral care and discipline of the school, as well as for much of the rest of the school's non-academic activity. The governors form the Board of Governors, also known as the Council of Management, which meets each term and is headed by a chairman. Past chairmen have included Donald Dalrymple ON, physician and Liberal MP for Bath (1868–73), J. J. Colman, head of the Colman's mustard company and Liberal MP for Norwich (1890–1898), Augustus Jessopp (1900–1903), James Stuart, founder of the University Extension Movement and Rector of the University of St Andrews (1903–1913), E. E. Blyth, first Lord Mayor of Norwich (1913–1934), David Cranage, Dean of Norwich (1934–1945), and General Manager of Norwich Union E. F. Williamson (1945–1954). The current chairman is P. J. E. Smith. Several governor positions are appointed by organisations closely connected to the school. The dean and chapter of Norwich Cathedral appoint one governor, and the Worshipful Company of Dyers appoint three. The school's historical connection with the Dyers, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, dates back to 1947 when HH Judge Norman Daynes, an Old Norvicensian, was the Prime Warden of the Company. The charitable trust of the Company continues to be a major benefactor of the school through the funding of building expansion and bursaries. The school is also a member of the Choir Schools' Association and the Lower School {{is a member}} of the Independent Association of Prep Schools.|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>headteachers</b> in {{the school}} {{improvement}} process has been considered crucial, both in developing and developed countries but no effective measures {{have been made by}} the government and other private educational agencies in Pakistan to develop their skills, knowledge and attitude. Acknowledging the importance of <b>headteachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 role in education system, the Aga Khan University, Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED) launched Advanced Diploma in School Management (ADISM) for the professional development of working and aspiring <b>headteachers</b> in cooperating schools. The study was conducted in two AKU-IED 2 ̆ 7 s cooperating schools to understand the <b>headteachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions {{about the impact of the}} ADISM programme towards enhancing understanding of their roles and responsibilities. A variety of research methods such as interviews, observations and document analysis were used for the purpose of collecting rich data. Different tools of data collection were used to triangulate the data to ensure the purpose of validity and objectivity. The findings suggest that the ADISM programme has contributed substantially towards enhancing <b>headteachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 understanding of their role as pedagogical leaders. This allowed them to assist teachers in curriculum enrichment and enhancing their instructional strategies. It reveals that, both the <b>headteachers</b> acquired knowledge about school improvement process such as teachers 2 ̆ 7 empowerment, developing schools 2 ̆ 7 shared vision and designing strategic plans to realize the vision. The study shows that the ADISM programme has also contributed towards changing the <b>headteachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 leadership style.

40|$|Internationally, {{leadership}} {{for social justice}} is gaining prominence as a global travelling theme. This article draws from the Scottish contribution to the International School Leadership Development Network (ISLDN) social justice strand and presents {{a case study of}} a relatively small education system similar in size to that of New Zealand, to explore one system's policy expectations and the practice realities of <b>headteachers</b> (principals) seeking to address issues around social justice. Scottish policy rhetoric places responsibility with <b>headteachers</b> to ensure socially just practices within their schools. However, those <b>headteachers</b> are working in schools located within unjust local, national and international contexts. The article explores briefly the emerging theoretical analyses of social justice and leadership. It then identifies the policy expectations, including those within the revised professional standards for <b>headteachers</b> in Scotland. The main focus is on the headteachers' perspectives of factors that help and hinder their practice of {{leadership for}} social justice. Macro systems-level data is used to contextualize equity and outcomes issues that <b>headteachers</b> are working to address. In the analysis of the dislocation between policy and reality, the article asks, 'to what extent can <b>headteachers</b> be held to account in the practice of social justice leadership?...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the issues and challenges faced by <b>headteachers</b> in practicing the suggested distributed leadership (DL) approach in three primary schools to their middle layer leaders. Design/methodology/approach – The study employed a case study design and data were collected through semi-structured interviews. A total of three <b>headteachers</b> were interviewed in examining and exploring challenges within the DL practices. The transcripts from the semi-structured interviews formed the basis of the findings. Findings – The findings suggest that senior teachers lack confidence in making decisions and rely on the consent from <b>headteachers</b> even though they are empowered to make their own decisions. Another significant issue faced by <b>headteachers</b> when distributing their leadership is the ability, expertise, experience, and willingness of teachers to hold leadership roles and responsibilities. Originality/value – The results are important since there have been few empirical studies on the issues and challenges faced by <b>headteachers</b> in practising DL approach in primary schools in the context of Malaysia. This initiative sidelines the traditional school leadership approach which emphasises on the accountability of <b>headteachers</b> as the sole school leader...|$|R

40|$|Little {{effort is}} made to study the role of <b>headteachers</b> in the eastern context, {{including}} Pakistan. This paper {{is based on the}} study conducted in the government and non-government schools in Pakistan in order to understand <b>headteachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 role in terms of the emerging demands, constraints and choices. The study suggests that the government school <b>headteachers</b> seem to be less proactive and more interested in maintaining status quo because of the influence of the 2 ̆ 7 topdown management model 2 ̆ 7. The study also suggests that the government <b>headteachers</b> have limited choices and many constraints because of the influence of the bureaucratic system. Their counterparts in non-government schools seem to be more proactive in making the best use of available choices and in maintaining equilibrium between the role demands, choices and constraints. The research findings further reveal that the non-government <b>headteachers</b> tend to have a broader vision of managing schools effectively than their counterparts in the government schools...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issues of headteachers' {{vocational}} competences and their needs for in-service training.

This is also one of the conditions for creating a meaningful career system in schooling and a basis for a systematic further vocational development of <b>headteachers.</b> The thesis suggests a generic top performance profile of <b>headteachers</b> of all school degrees and a structure of their in-service training which corresponds to necessary competence.

40|$|The {{professional}} development teachers (PDTs) were expected by their school {{management and the}} Aga Khan University, Institute for Educational Development, to work with their <b>headteachers</b> and their colleagues in schools and initiate changes for school improvement. In the Pakistani context the role of <b>headteachers</b> as instructional leader is still not recognized. They are playing their roles as administrators. This {{is the reason that}} {{professional development}} teachers faced challenges and did not get support and encouragement from the <b>headteachers,</b> in the process of change for school improvement. The study was conducted in two government schools {{in order to understand the}} head teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions about the role of professional development teachers (PDTs) in school improvement. A case study method was used to gather relevant information within a qualitative paradigm. This method helped to understand the perceptions about the role of the PDTs. A variety of data collection tools were used to triangulate information for reliability and validity purposes. The study findings suggest that in the beginning the PDTs seemed to be ambitious in bringing about change. Therefore, sometimes they did not consult their heads. At the same time, the <b>headteachers</b> were un-clear about the role of PDTs so they resisted the change, and dealt with the PDTs as ordinary teachers. The <b>headteachers</b> did not encourage PDTs to work with the teachers in order to develop their skills. The PDTs were asked to teach the students and prepare them to achieve good results in the examination. But gradually, PDTs learned that without the cooperation of <b>headteachers,</b> they would not be able to initiate change. The study also suggests that there appeared a mismatch between the perceptions of PDTs and of <b>headteachers</b> about school improvement. PDTs saw their role in the professional development of teachers as improving students learning, whereas, the <b>headteachers</b> thought the PDTs should help them in maintaining school discipline. As time passed, the <b>headteachers</b> started appreciating the PDTs role as change agents and facilitators in the teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional development. However, the PDTs 2 ̆ 7 role has not yet been officially recognized by the senior officers in the education department The study proposes some recommendations, which include: (a) recognition of PDTs 2 ̆ 7 role at the government level; (b) school-based professional development programs; (c) strategic school development plan; and (d) professional development of <b>headteachers</b> and supervisory personnel. These recommendations may help <b>headteachers</b> and others to understand the PDTs 2 ̆ 7 role in school improvement...|$|R
