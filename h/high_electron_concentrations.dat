Comparison of the calculated mobilities with experimental data shows that scattering by short range potentials is the dominant mechanism limiting the electron mobilities in unintentionally doped nitrides with large electron concentrations. In the case of Al{sub x}Ga{sub 1 -x}N alloys, the reduction in the electron concentration due to the upward shift of the conduction band relative to the native defect level can account for the experimentally measured mobilities.

In particular, it is found that ferromagnetism is stabilized only for these values of frustration parameters, which lead to the single peaked noninterating density of states at the band edge. Once, two or more peaks appear in the noninteracting density of states at the band egde the ferromagnetic state is suppressed.

The screening of the electron-phonon interaction was included within the static random-phase approximation and the finite extent of the electron wave function in the quantum well was accounted for.

30|$|Our {{modeling}} [1] {{has shown}} that at the liquid nitrogen temperature, <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> mobility can be obtained at <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the well, which enhances 2 DEG screening and decreases hole concentration. Such an increase of the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> could be achieved by delta-doping of barriers or by applying the top-gate bias voltage. Growth of the mobility {{with the increase of}} the quantum well composition x could be explained by a lower concentration of heavy holes at the same value of the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration.</b> Since the concentration of holes in QW is often higher than 1015  cm− 3, the fabrication of high purity samples with low concentration of residual charged impurities (of the order of 1014  cm− 3) will not improve the electron mobility sufficiently. Our modeling shows that because of the high hole concentration, the purity of samples in many configurations is of a lower importance for obtaining <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> mobility than the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> in the well.

By repetition of controlled doping cycles we have shown that stacking of multiple Ge:P two-dimensional electron gases results in high electron densities in Ge (> 1020 cm 3). Because of the strong vertical electron confinement, closely stacked 2 D layers – although interacting – maintain their individuality in terms of electron transport.

It is also demonstrated that (GaAsNSe/GaAs SLs) /(GaAsN/GaAsSb SLs) /GaAs heterostructures are effective to reduce the strain accumulation in the layers, which will also form effective separated confinement heterostructure. The temperature dependence of the PL peak intensity is drastically improved by combining the GaAsN/GaAsSb SLs with the GaAsNSe/GaAs SLs following this scheme.

40|$|Anomalous Hall effect {{arises in}} systems with both spin-orbit {{coupling}} and magnetization. Generally, {{there are three}} mechanisms contributing to anomalous Hall conductivity: intrinsic, side jump, and skew scattering. The standard diagrammatic approach to the anomalous Hall effect is limited to computation of ladder diagrams. We demonstrate that this approach is insufficient. An important additional contribution comes from diagrams with {{a single pair of}} intersecting disorder lines. This contribution constitutes an inherent part of skew scattering on pairs of closely located defects and essentially modifies previously obtained results for anomalous Hall conductivity. We argue that this statement is general and applies to all models of anomalous Hall effect. We illustrate it by an explicit calculation for two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions with weak disorder. In this case, inclusion of the diagrams with crossed impurity lines reverses the sign of the skew scattering term and strongly suppresses the total Hall conductivity at <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures; extended versio...|$|E

Samples with two occupied subbans exhibit a strong anomalous negative magnetoresitance, reaching ≈ 25 % of a zero field value at B = 12 T. The resistance decrease is more pronounced for lower temperatures and higher electron concentrations. We explain this behaviour by an increase of the second subband mobility due to the freezing-out of the scattering of 0 ' electrons.

Two representative sets of In-polar InN grown by molecular beam epitaxy with Mg concentrations ranging from 1. 2 × 10 ^ 17 cm^- 3 to 8 × 10 ^ 20 cm^- 3 are compared. P-type conductivity is indicated for the Mg concentration range of 1 × 10 ^ 18 cm^- 3 to 9 × 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3 from a systematic investigation of the longitudinal optical phonon plasmon broadening and the mobility parameter in dependence of the Mg concentration.

The accumulation layer occurs at the surface of InSb nanowires. The surface accumulation layer in the InSb conduction band causes a downward band bending near the surface region that eventually leads to lowering of the electron tunneling barriers. Moreover, a sufficient spacing between the InSb nanoemitter can significantly reduce the screening effect.

The situation {{is similar to the}} case of GaN, and analogous explanations have been tentatively given to account for the background carrier concentration [1 – 10]. The reduction in the background carrier density and increase in the mobility were achieved recently, and electron densities as low as 4 × 1019 cm− 3 were obtained with metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) [11]. However, the best results in terms of electron density and carrier mobility were achieved using MBE. It has also been shown that the Hall mobility increases with increasing layer thickness in both MBE and MOVPE samples. This is believed to be due to the reduction in the defect density with increasing thickness [12]. Higashiwaki and Matsui [13] found, however, that the improvement in Hall mobility with increasing thickness is valid up to a critical thickness value of 150 nm, above which the mobility is approximately constant. It was recently shown that irradiation of InN films with 2 MeV He+ ions followed by thermal annealing below 500 °C creates films with <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> and mobilities [14]. Recently, Lu et al. [15] have reported that the Hall carrier density does not approach zero as the layer thickness decreases. In order to explain their observations, they suggested the existence of more than one conducting layer, one of which was a surface charge layer, to explain the capacitance-voltage measurements [15]. This hypothesis was also confirmed by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy [16 – 18]. The work shows clearly the surface electron accumulation which is interpreted as the consequence of donor-type surface states pinning the surface Fermi level above the conduction band minimum.|$|E

We achieve <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{in the range}} of 10 ^ 19 - 10 ^ 20 cm^- 3 and low resistivities (~ 120 W/Ohm) with atomic-level control over the doping process. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and magnetotransport measurements at 4 K, we detail each doping step, focusing on atomically precise doping for the fabrication of nano-electronic devices in single crystal Ge. By combining ex-situ wet processing with in-situ homoepitaxy we produce pristine Ge(001) surfaces with low defect densities (~ 0. 2 %) and wide mono-atomic terraces (80 - 100 nm), which represent ideal starting surfaces to obtain uniform hydrogen resist layers suitable for STM lithography of nano-scale devices. Next, we study the adsorption and dissociation behavior of PH 3 and P 2 molecules on Ge(001) at the atomic level using STM. At low coverages we characterize Ge-P heterodimers and ejected Ge atoms as clear signatures for P incorporation into Ge(001) between 200 °C and 250 °C for both PH 3 and P 2. At saturation coverages we observe for PH 3 a maximum density of incorporated P of 0. 5 monolayer, whereas doping from P 2 molecules can yield nearly full monolayer coverages. We then present P d-doping of bulk Ge from PH 3 gas and P 2 molecules to obtain confined Ge:P d-layers with active electron sheet densities between 10 ^ 13 - 10 ^ 14 cm- 2. The low thermal budget (250 °C) required allows us to stack multiple P d-layers to increase the active carrier density in thin Ge:P films to ~ 2 x 10 ^ 20 cm^- 3 with abrupt dopant profiles. Using this method we are able to dope thin epilayers of Ge-on-insulator, whilst preserving the integrity and stain (~ 0. 35 %) of the substrates.

Our results demonstrate the macroscopic ferromagnetism in (In,Fe) As with magnetic anisotropy {{that depends on the}} <b>electron</b> <b>concentration.</b> Non-crystalline AMR is also observed in the 100 nm-thick layer, but its magnitude is as small as 10 ^- 5, suggesting that there is no s-d scattering near the Fermi level of (In,Fe) As. We propose the origin of the eight-fold symmetric crystalline anisotropy in (In,Fe) As...|$|R
