5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
25|$|O'Rourke {{became ill}} in early 1987 and was misdiagnosed by doctors at Kaiser Permanente Hospital as having Crohn's disease. She was {{prescribed}} prednisone {{to treat the}} disease, which caused <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> to appear puffy and large. On January 31, 1988, O'Rourke suddenly became ill again, vomiting and unable to keep anything in her stomach. The next morning, she collapsed while preparing {{to leave for the}} hospital and her stepfather called paramedics. O'Rourke suffered a cardiac arrest en route to the hospital, and after resuscitation, she was airlifted by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she died later that day.|$|E

25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
500|$|A quick {{shot of the}} [...] "IV" [...] tattoo inked on Beyoncé's left {{ring finger}} is shown (a {{reference}} to her album's title, 4), before she bathes in a tub of flowers as well as [...] berries and blows billows of smoke. As she continues to caress her upper-body, an array of light imagery is projected behind her, serving as a backdrop. During the second verse, the video begins to use symmetrical visual arts. Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears trickling down <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling down <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> Beyoncé chants to her love interest to make love to her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E
500|$|Hindley's {{father had}} {{served with the}} Parachute Regiment and had been {{stationed}} in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known in the army as a [...] "hard man" [...] and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he {{taught her how to}} fight, and insisted that she [...] "stick up for herself". When Hindley was 8, a local boy approached her in the street and scratched both of <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> with his fingernails, drawing blood. She burst into tears and ran into her parents' house, to be met by her father, who demanded that she [...] "Go and punch him , because if you don't I'll leather you!" [...] Hindley found the boy and succeeded in knocking him down with a sequence of punches, as her father had taught her. As she wrote later, [...] "at eight years old I'd scored my first victory".|$|E

500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville. She was visited by journalists, medical professionals, religious personnel and the [...] "plain curious" [...] from across the country, many of whom donated money to Ellen's family {{to be allowed to}} see her. Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Aguilera with [...] "strawberry-blonde" [...] hair. It {{begins with}} a close-up of a gun barrel. Then, she slowly walks through a [...] "deserted" [...] bedroom and lies down in the room, which is filled with charcoal, while crying. She is seen with mascara streaming down <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> As the scene moves on, Aguilera is fighting against a shirtless man, who is considered her lover. The clip ends as Aguilera takes off her shirt in an [...] "Inception-like dreamworld". Critical response to [...] "You Lost Me" [...] video was positive: Latina writer Mariela Rosario and UK magazine OK! noted that the clip was a comeback by Aguilera following the video for Bionic lead single [...] "Not Myself Tonight". Monica Hererra from Billboard also thought that it represents [...] "a kind of return to form for Aguilera". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Brad Wete thought that the video for [...] "You Lost Me" [...] "has some quality material". Similarly, MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan complimented {{it as one of}} Aguilera's best videos ever.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} image {{is that of}} a young woman, {{possibly}} Venus, which has been dubbed the [...] "Mona Lisa of the Galilee".

2500|$|In {{her later}} years, Lamarr turned to plastic surgery to {{preserve}} the looks she was terrified of losing, but the results were disastrous.

[...] "She had plastic surgery thinking it could revive her looks and her career, but it backfired and distorted her beauty". Anthony Loder also claimed that Lamarr was addicted to pills.|$|E

2500|$|Rola's {{television}} persona comprises distinctive characteristics, exuding {{an overall}} childlike naiveté, innocence, and playfulness. Signature affectations such as puffing <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> in embarrassment, holding an [...] "OK" [...] hand gesture over her cheek, and curling her tongue over {{her upper lip}} make Rola a common subject for Japanese impersonators, who also mimic her ditzy responses and constant giggles. She falls within the model-idol category of Japanese [...] "talent" [...] (tarento) as not actually possessing any particular talent, but Rola also presents comic possibilities by her mere presence. In the wake of Rola's popularity, aspiring talent Arie Mizusawa began appearing on Japanese television sporting cute affectations nearly identical to Rola, to an extent that entertainment media referred to Mizusawa as [...] "Rola 2" [...] and both she and Rola as [...] "twins".|$|E
2500|$|Channing {{made her}} {{television}} debut on Sesame Street {{in the role}} of The Number Painter's female victim. She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> puffed out with cotton and her nose was wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy." [...] The TV movie has gone on to enjoy cult status, becoming available on DVD in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Thiên Mụ Pagoda, {{with its}} seven storied stupa, the tallest in Vietnam, {{is often the}} subject of folk rhymes and ca dao about Huế, such is its iconic status and {{association}} with the city. It {{is regarded as the}} unofficial symbol of the former imperial capital. The temple was built in 1601 at the direction of Nguyễn Hoàng, the head of the Nguyễn Lords. According to the royal annals, Hoang was on a sightseeing trip and holiday to see the seas and mountains of the local area when he passed by the hill which is now the site of the Thien Mu Pagoda. He heard of a local legend, in which an old lady, known as Thiên Mụ (literally [...] "fairy woman"), wearing a red shirt and blue trousers, sat at the site, rubbing <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> She said that a lord would come to the hill and erect a pagoda to pray for the country' prosperity. According to the local legend, the lady vanished after making her prophecy. When Hoang heard this, he ordered the construction of a temple at the site and it was called Thiên Mụ Tự.|$|E

2500|$|Only two sanctuaries to Protesilaus are attested. There was {{a shrine}} of Protesilaus at Phylace, {{his home in}} Thessaly, where his widow was left lacerating <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> in {{mourning}} him, and games were organised there in his honour, Pindar noted. The tomb of Protesilaus at Elaeus in the Thracian Chersonese is documented in the 5th century, when, during the Persian War, votive treasure deposited at his tomb was plundered by the satrap Artayctes, under permission from Xerxes. The Greeks later captured and executed Artayctes, returning the treasure. The tomb was mentioned again when Alexander the Great arrived at Elaeus on his campaign against the Persian Empire. He offered a sacrifice on the tomb, hoping to avoid the fate of Protesilaus {{when he arrived in}} Asia. [...] Like Protesilaus before him, Alexander was the first to set foot on Asian soil during his campaign. Philostratus writing of this temple in the early 3rd century AD, speaks of a cult statue of Protesilaus at this temple [...] "standing on a base which was shaped like the prow of a boat;" [...] Gisela Richter noted coins of Elaeus from the time of Commodus that show on their reverses Protesilaus on the prow of a ship, in helmet, cuirass and short chiton.|$|E
2500|$|... "This sonnet {{plays with}} poetic {{conventions}} in which, for example, the mistress's eyes are {{compared with the}} sun, her lips with coral, and <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> with roses. His mistress, says the poet, is nothing like this conventional image, but is as lovely as any woman". Here, Barbara Mowat offers her opinion of the meaning behind Sonnet 130; this work breaks the mold to which Sonnets had come to conform. Shakespeare composed a sonnet which seems to parody a great many sonnets of the time. Poets like Thomas Watson, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes were all part of this sonnet craze and each wrote sonnets proclaiming love for an almost unimaginable figure; Patrick Crutwell posits that Sonnet 130 could actually be a satire of the Thomas Watson poem [...] "Passionate Century of Love", {{pointing out that the}} Watson poem contains {{all but one of the}} platitudes that Shakespeare is making fun of in Sonnet 130. However, E.G. Rogers points out the similarities between Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] Sonnet 130, and Richard Linche's Poem collection entitled [...] "Diella." [...] There is a great deal of similarity between sections of the Diella poem collection and Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130", for example in [...] "130" [...] we see, [...] "If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head," [...] where in [...] "Diella" [...] we see [...] "Her hayre exceeds fold forced in the smallest wire." [...] Each work uses a comparison of hairs to wires; while in modern sense this may seem unflattering, one could argue that Linche's work draws upon the beauty of weaving gold and that Shakespeare mocks this with harsh comparison. This, along with other similarities in textual content, lead, as E.G. Rogers points out, the critic to believe that Diella may have been the source of inspiration for both homage, by Watson's [...] "Passionate Century of Love," [...] and satire by Shakespeare's [...] "Sonnet 130." [...] The idea of Satire is further enforced by final couplet of [...] "130" [...] in which the speaker delivers his most expositional line: [...] "And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare." [...] This line projects the message behind this work, demeaning the false comparisons made by many poets of the time.|$|E
