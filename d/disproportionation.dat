5|$|In {{absence of}} other ligands, its aqueous {{solutions}} are unstable {{with respect to}} <b>disproportionation</b> into Cu and CuCl2. In part for this reason samples in air assume a green coloration (see photograph in upper right).|$|E
5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to <b>disproportionation</b> in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect.|$|E
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its <b>disproportionation</b> or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to <b>disproportionation</b> in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; {{evaporation}} of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH3)6)+, with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit {{the isolation of}} these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands. For example, 15-crown-5 has high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2Å, which is enough to fit sodium ion (1.9Å). Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na− are obtainable)|date=1974|volume=96|issue=2|pages=608–609|doi=10.1021/ja00809a060}} {{by the addition of}} cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via <b>disproportionation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide Mn2O7, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to <b>disproportionation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to <b>disproportionation</b> to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
25|$|The base-induced <b>disproportionation</b> of benzaldehyde, the Cannizzaro reaction, affords {{equal amounts}} of {{benzoate}} and benzyl alcohol; the latter can be removed by distillation.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous AuCl3 {{begins to}} {{decompose}} to AuCl at around 160°C; however, {{this in turn}} undergoes <b>disproportionation</b> at higher temperatures to give gold metal and AuCl3.|$|E
25|$|The Cannizzaro reaction, {{named after}} its {{discoverer}} Stanislao Cannizzaro, is a chemical reaction {{that involves the}} base-induced <b>disproportionation</b> of an aldehyde lacking a hydrogen atom in the alpha position.|$|E
25|$|If the {{aldehyde}} cannot form an enolate (e.g., benzaldehyde), {{addition of}} strong base induces the Cannizzaro reaction. This reaction results in <b>disproportionation,</b> producing {{a mixture of}} alcohol and carboxylic acid.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} both of the above methods is incompatibility with free amine or alkene functionality, both of which undergo competitive oxidation. The use of bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB) as the terminal oxidant avoids this problem. BAIB is unable to oxidize the nitroxide radical directly, and initial formation of oxoammonium {{is believed to be}} due to acid-catalyzed <b>disproportionation.</b> BAIB may then oxidize the resulting hydroxylamine to an oxoammonium salt. Although the reaction is conducted under acidic conditions (acetic acid is a byproduct, and is often added to facilitate <b>disproportionation),</b> selectivity for primary alcohol oxidation is substantial. Base-sensitive functional groups, such as epoxides, are tolerated under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|DMSO is metabolized by <b>disproportionation</b> to {{dimethyl}} sulfide and dimethyl sulfone. It {{is subject to}} renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood {{dimethyl sulfide}}, which may cause a blood borne halitosis symptom.|$|E
25|$|Four {{chemical}} processes contribute to industrial benzene production: catalytic reforming, toluene hydrodealkylation, toluene <b>disproportionation,</b> and steam cracking. According to the ATSDR Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformats accounted for approximately 44–50% {{of the total}} U.S benzene production.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{chemical}} complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene, then toluene <b>disproportionation</b> (TDP) {{may be an}} attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, 2 toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.|$|E
25|$|In these {{reactions}} {{two free}} radicals react {{with each other}} to produce products that are not free radicals. Two common forms of termination are recombination, where the two radicals combine to form one larger molecule, and <b>disproportionation,</b> where one radical transfers a hydrogen atom to the other, giving an alkene and an alkane.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, a {{group of}} Soviet {{scientists}} published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical <b>disproportionation</b> of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and XRD patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).|$|E
25|$|Manganates are {{unstable}} towards <b>disproportionation</b> {{in all but}} {{the most}} alkaline of aqueous solutions. The ultimate products are permanganate and manganese dioxide, but the kinetics are complex and the mechanism may involved protonated and/or manganese(V) species.−/MnO42− and MnO42−/MnO43− electrode reactions in alkaline solutions at solid electrodes | first1 = K. | last1 = Sekula-Brzezińska | first2 = P.

25|$|The {{environmental}} chemistry of some radioactive {{elements such as}} plutonium {{is complicated by the}} fact that solutions of this element can undergo <b>disproportionation</b> and as a result many different oxidation states can coexist at once. Some work has been done on the identification of the oxidation state and coordination number of plutonium and the other actinides under different conditions. This includes work on both solutions of relatively simple complexes2+, NpO2+, Np4+, and Pu3+ by X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy", Inorganic Chemistry, 1997, 36, 4676–4683)5]6− Ion", Inorganic Chemistry, 1998, 37, 2893–2899 and work on colloids Two of the key matrixes are soil/rocks and concrete, in these systems the chemical properties of plutonium have been studied using methods such as EXAFS and XANES.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used catalysts for this process are metal halides, particularly aluminium chloride. This {{is referred to as}} a redistribution reaction, which is a double displacement involving the same central element. It may also {{be thought of as a}} <b>disproportionation</b> reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon (Si has a nominal oxidation number IV in all three species). However, the utility of the oxidation number concept for a covalent molecule, even a polar covalent molecule, is ambiguous. The silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in SiCl4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in SiH4 since Cl is far more electronegative than is H.|$|E

500|$|Hypoiodous acid is {{unstable}} to <b>disproportionation.</b> The hypoiodite ions thus formed disproportionate {{immediately to}} give iodide and iodate: ...|$|E
500|$|Lower iodides may be {{produced}} either through thermal decomposition or <b>disproportionation,</b> or {{by reducing the}} higher iodide with hydrogen or a metal, for example: ...|$|E
500|$|Copper is {{also found}} in many {{superoxide}} dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides by converting it (by <b>disproportionation)</b> to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide: ...|$|E
500|$|When a lower bromide is wanted, {{either a}} higher halide {{may be reduced}} using {{hydrogen}} or a metal as a reducing agent, or thermal decomposition or <b>disproportionation</b> may be used, as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Chlorine forms four oxoacids: {{hypochlorous acid}} (HOCl), chlorous acid (HOClO), chloric acid (HOClO2), and perchloric acid (HOClO3). As {{can be seen}} from the redox {{potentials}} given in the table to the right, chlorine is much more stable towards <b>disproportionation</b> in acidic solutions than in alkaline solutions: ...|$|E
500|$|Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 {{oxidation}} state) {{are slightly}} {{more common than}} those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, CrF4, CrCl4, and CrBr4, can be produced by treating the trihalides (...) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to <b>disproportionation</b> reactions and are not stable in water.|$|E
500|$|Bromous {{acids and}} bromites are very unstable, {{although}} the {{strontium and barium}} bromites are known. More important are the bromates, which are prepared {{on a small scale}} by oxidation of bromide by aqueous hypochlorite, and are strong oxidising agents. Unlike chlorates, which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perclorate, the bromate anion is stable to <b>disproportionation</b> in both acidic and aqueous solutions. Bromic acid is a strong acid. Bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|All {{pentavalent}} and hexavalent americium compounds {{are complex}} salts such as KAmO2F2, Li3AmO4 and Li6AmO6, Ba3AmO6, AmO2F2. These high oxidation states Am(IV), Am(V) and Am(VI) {{can be prepared}} from Am(III) by oxidation with ammonium persulfate in dilute nitric acid, with silver(I) oxide in perchloric acid, or with ozone or sodium persulfate in sodium carbonate solutions. The pentavalent oxidation state of americium was first observed in 1951. It is present in aqueous solution {{in the form of}} [...] ions (acidic) or [...] ions (alkaline) which are however unstable and subject to several rapid <b>disproportionation</b> reactions: ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable {{compounds}} with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic {{and feature}} the dimeric cation, Hg. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces <b>disproportionation</b> to [...] and elemental mercury. Mercury(I) chloride, a colorless solid {{also known as}} calomel, is really the compound with the formula Hg2Cl2, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. Mercury(I) hydride, a colorless gas, has the [...] formula HgH, containing no Hg-Hg bond.|$|E
500|$|Nitrous acid (HNO2) is {{not known}} as a pure compound, but is a common {{component}} in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent: its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite ( [...] , bent) solutions, although already at room temperature <b>disproportionation</b> to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant. It is a weak acid with pK'a 3.35 at 18°C. They may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate. They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide, to hyponitrous acid with tin(II), and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide. Salts of hydrazinium [...] react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen. Sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above 100mg/kg, but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage. It {{is also used to}} synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Chlorination {{of metals}} with Cl2 usually {{leads to a}} higher {{oxidation}} state than bromination with Br2 when multiple oxidation states are available, such as in MoCl5 and MoBr3. Chlorides {{can be made by}} reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrochloric acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas. These methods work best when the chloride product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative chlorination of the element with chlorine or hydrogen chloride, high-temperature chlorination of a metal oxide or other halide by chlorine, a volatile metal chloride, carbon tetrachloride, or an organic chloride. For instance, zirconium dioxide reacts with chlorine at standard conditions to produce zirconium tetrachloride, and uranium trioxide reacts with hexachloropropene when heated under reflux to give uranium tetrachloride. The second example also involves a reduction in oxidation state, which can also be achieved by reducing a higher chloride using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent. This may also be achieved by thermal decomposition or <b>disproportionation</b> as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these <b>disproportionation</b> reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale. Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Manganic acid {{cannot be}} formed {{because of its}} rapid <b>disproportionation.</b> However, its second acid {{dissociation}} constant has been estimated by pulse radiolysis techniques: ...|$|E
2500|$|The CIDNP {{experiment}} is conducted within the NMR tube. [...] The radicals {{are produced by}} thermal or photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or <b>disproportionation</b> of radical pairs.|$|E
