40|$|The {{morphological}} {{development of}} medial moraines on Austerdalsbreen, Norway and Berendon Glacier, British Columbia {{is dependent upon}} englacial debris supply. A literature review suggests {{that this is a}} general case. An 'ablation-dominant' model of moraine formation is proposed which relates englacial debris supply to the site and manner of englacial incorporation of debris relative to the <b>firn</b> <b>line.</b> On Austerdalsbreen a prominent medial moraine is formed by the confluence of two ice-cap outlet glaciers below the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> (below <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> subtype of the model). Moraine debris is derived from extraglacial bedrock outcrops between the two ice streams and is englacially entrained via crevasses to which lower depth limits apply. Revelation of crevasse-bound debris generates a distinct ice-cored morphology which is destroyed as crevasse-bottoms are revealed downglacier. In this below <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> subtype, moraines formed by confluence of ice-cap outlet glaciers below the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> are characterized by a discrete debris supply distinct from subglacial removal of bedrock. [...] On Berendon Glacier ice streams coalesce above the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> (above <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> subtype); debris entrained between ice streams is derived both from extraglacial rock outcrops and from subnival and subglacial bedrock zones. Extraglacially derived debris undergoes seasonal sedimentation with snowfall; debris extends throughout ice depth. As a result a distinct moraine morphology is present in the terminal area in response to continuing englacial debris supply. The bulk of moraine debris is found to be transported at depth near the glacier base following subglacial and subnival derivation in the firn basin. Upper englacial debris (related to extraglacial rockslope activity in the firn basin) is of small quantity. [...] In addition, moraines are generated in many cases by confluence below the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> of large ice-streams carrying a large lateral moraine load. Peculiar ice structures and patterns of ice flow commonly observed from confluence zones have been considered to determine moraine morphology rather than englacial debris supply. However this 'ice-stream interaction' model which was tested on Berendon Glacier where two large ice-streams converge explains moraine morphology in the confluence zone only. Down-glacier, moraine morphology accords with those moraines formed above the firn-line i. e. is dependent upon the nature of englacial debris supply. [...] Examination of debris texture, scanning electron microscopy (s. e. m.) of quartz grains and clay mineral investigations form the basis of sedimentological analyses. Medial moraine debris cannot be rigorously distinguished from other elements of the debris system; primary comminution processes produce debris exhibiting a wide particle-size range independent of parent bedrock. A wide spectrum of particle sizes is produced. Limited comminution following initial derivation (i. e. passive glacial transport) is reflected in quartz grain surface textures and a coarser mean size of medial moraine debris compared to subglacial lodgement tills...|$|E
40|$|The Dickson Land {{peninsula}} {{is located}} in central West-Spitsbergen between the NNE branches of Isfjorden. The climatic <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> lying at 500 m causes plateau glaciers with outlet tongues which are characteristic of S-Dickson Land. The distribution of valley glaciers and the variations of the orographic <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> depend on wind direction. In comparing the firn lines established by the methods of LICHTENECKER (1938) and VISSER (1938), to the values calculated by the method of v. HÖFER (1879), differences of up to l 07 m are found. These differences may depend on the inclination and distance relationships of the glaciers {{above and below the}} real firn lines. During the latest glacial advance, Dickson Land was located on the peripheries of two local glaciation centers. At that time an inland glaciation of West-Spitsbergen did not exist. The formation of a subglacial channel system dates back to the maximum extent of the late glacial phase before 17500 B. P, (+ 2000 /- 1375 years). A correlation of postglacial stadia and 14 C dated marine terraces (FEYLING-HANSSEN & OLSSON, 1960; FEYLING-HANSSEN, 1965) is possible. Considering isostatic movement and the difference between calculated and real firn lines, a postglacial stadium at about 10400 B. P. can be reconstructed with a <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> lying 265 m above former sea level. On average, the absolute depression below the recent <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> amounted to 246 m. Stagnation at 9650 B. P. coincided with a <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> at 315 m above former sea level and a depression of 173 m. Around 1890 A. D., glacial fluctuations corresponded to a <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> at 415 m (depression: 64 m). To some extent the morphology of the main valleys appears to depend on structure and petrography. Therefore their value as indicators of former glaciations is questionable. The periglacial forms are shown on a large-scale map. At the time of the "Holocene warm interval", between 7000 and 2000 B. P. (FEYLING-HANSSEN, 1955 a, 1965), an increase of periglacial activity seems likely. This can be explained by a simultaneous increase in the depth of the active layer in both soil and bedrock...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of glacierization of the Tsambagarav {{mountain}} ridge {{were determined}} {{on the basis}} of images obtained from satellites Corona, Landsat‑ 5, Spot‑ 4, Landsat‑ 8 together with results of field investigations. Inventories of glaciers located on the ridge had been prepared for three time periods: 1968, 2006, and 2015. Glacierization of the ridge during the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum was then reconstructed. In 2015, 67 glaciers formed the ridge glacierization with their total area 68. 41 km 2. Mean weighed altitude of the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> averaged 3748 m. The flat‑top glaciers accounted for almost 40 % of the glacierization area, and the glaciers composed 6 complexes. For the period of the LIA maximum, 73 glaciers had been reconstructed, their total area was 128. 4 km 2, and the calculated firn line altitude – 3583 м; these glaciers were combined into two complexes where the flat‑top glaciers predominated as well. By 1968, the area of the glacierization decreased by 36 %, and the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> altitude increased by  89 m. By 2006, area of glaciers decreased down to 71. 32 km 2, and the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> altitude increased more by 60 m.  Finally, in 2006 – 2015, area of the glacierization contracted additionally by 2. 91 km 2, and the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> altitude still more increased by 16 m. Over the whole period from the LIA maximum, the flat‑top glaciers reduced the most.  The general rate of contraction of glaciers tends to increase. Reconstructed rates of retreating of the valley glaciers of the Tsambagarav ridge are similar to estimates of other researchers made for the nearest centers of glacierization.  Continuation of the current trend to a rise of summer temperature and a growth of precipitation should result in primary fast degradation of the flat‑top glaciers and reorganization of morphological structure of the glacierization. </p...|$|E

The crosspolarisation SAR images (HV and VH) contain more backscatter variation and reveal more details on the glacier than the HH and VV polarised images. HH and VV images are very similar, as well are HV and VH images. An icefall is clearly visible, and crevasses are visi-ble in L-Band. The present year's equilibrium line cannot {{be seen on the}} SAR images, however a distinct line is visible on the C-Band SAR images.

Monitoring of the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> will be a valuable source of information. The <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> is itself not affected by yearly variations in equilibrium-line altitude, but a permanent change in the average equilibrium-line altitude will eventually result in a change in firn-line altitude. The firn-line altitude serves thus as a valuable climate indicator and appears to be easily detectable on SAR images due to strong difference in backscatter between ice and firn. Eventually, this may call for the development of correlation fac-tors between firn-line altitude (FLA) and mass balance in contrast to today's use of equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) in order to use SAR for routine mass-balance monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of glaciers mass balance and the derivation of meteorological parameters {{by means of}} remote sensing techniques are of particular scientific interest for glaciological and clima-tological studies. Using synergistic approaches, SAR-data complement field studies in remote and inaccessible areas and provide information with a high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the operational application of the existing SAR-archives for monitoring purposes require a more detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of the observable radar glacier zones. Backscatter modelling based on snow pit data gathered on the Antarctic Peninsula is used to inves-tigate typical radar returns from {{the upper and lower}} boundary lines of the frozen percolation zone. The lower one is a clearly identifiable limit between bare ice and highly metamorphosed, coarse-grained snow. As it is impossible to identify the year of origin of this snowpack, the term <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> is suggested. Only occasionally the late-summer <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> position coincides with the equilibrium line. In the absence of field measurements, <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> altitude can be regarded as a first approximation to the ELA, although it might lead to an overestimation of glaciers mass balance. The upper boundary, the dry snow line, is described as a temporarily and spatially very persistent feature in SAR-imagery. Its position is very stable in the time range of years to decades. Positional shifts of this line provide information about the occurrence of singular high temperature events leading to enhanced metamorphism of the snow and accumulation conditions in the highest areas of the glaciers. Addi-tionally, model results confirm the assumption that a threshold of – 8 dB is appropriate to delimit the upper boundary line of the frozen percolation radar zone. This facilitates direct monitoring of the dry snow line...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{glaciation}} of the mountain massifs Mongun-Taiga, Tavan-Boghd-Ola, Turgeni- Nuru, and Harhira-Nuru. The glaciation is represented mostly by small forms that sometimes form a single complex of domeshaped peaks. According to the authors, the modern glaciated area of the mountain massifs is 21. 2 km 2 (Tavan-Boghd-Ola), 20. 3 km 2 (Mongun-Taiga), 42 km 2 (Turgeni- Nuru), and 33. 1 km 2 (Harhira-Nuru). The area of the glaciers has been shrinking since the mid 1960 ’s. In 1995 – 2008, the rate of reduction of the glaciers’ area has grown considerably: valley glaciers were rapidly degrading and splitting; accumulation of morainic material in the lower parts of the glaciers accelerated. Small glaciers transformed into snowfields and rock glaciers. There has been also a degradation of the highest parts of the glaciers and the collapse of the glacial complexes with a single zone of accumulation into isolated from each other glaciers. Reduced snow cover area has led to a rise in the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> and the disintegration of a common accumulation area of the glacial complex. In the of the Mongun-Taiga massif, in 1995 – 2008, the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> rose by 200 – 300 m. The reduction of the glaciers significantly lagged behind the change in the position of the accumulation area boundary. In the past two years, there has been a significant recovery of the glaciers that could eventually lead to their slower degradation or stabilization of the glaciers in the study area...|$|E

40|$|Multi-year SAR data is used {{to study}} the {{seasonal}} dynamic of the snow melt patterns on the ice cap of King George Island, Antarctica. The snow cover of the entire ice cap becomes wet during sum-mer months, however, in the highest elevations frequent refreeze and melt cycles are observed. Bare ice areas form in the lowest elevations of the ice cap. These findings are in good agreements with energy balance studies and results of a ground penetrating radar survey. Backscatter values in in-termediate elevations show a marked rise {{at the end of}} the ablation season. This fact is attributed to an increasing surface roughness on a wet metamorphosed snow cover {{at the end of the}} ablation sea-son. The influence of thresholds on the determination of the extent of the bare ice radar zone in summer and winter imagery as well as in ascending and descending orbit is investigated. As a con-sequence, the border of the bare ice radar zone have been mapped using thresholds of – 14 dB in summer and – 6 dB in winter imagery. It could be shown, that thresholds of – 12 dB and – 8 dB, re-spectively, do not change significantly the extent of this radar glacier zone. <b>Firn</b> <b>line</b> altitudes were mapped for several consecutive years.

It was shown that the GIS-techniques based on the use of this model together with data on glaciation and the relief digital model may significantly simplify searching of new lakes. Application of a system of the mudflow movement modeling makes possible to estimate a risk level in a case of a lake bursting. Current information about changing elevations of the glacier surfaces was obtained duet to the radar inter‑ ferometry and the altimeter data. The digital model of the river Pskem upper course (the DEM) had been built using the satellite TerraSAR‑X/TanDEM‑X data (2011 – 2012). All datasets of the elevations were checked for horizontal shifts of the relief digital models relative to the ICESat profiles (2003 – 2008). Evaluation of accuracy and morphological analysis of all the relief models for the investigated region were also made. DEMs differencing, the difference between ICESat measure‑ ments and DEM, nearby ICESat footprints within one track and between the tracks were carried out to assess the change in elevations of the glacier surfaces. Average rate of the surface lowering of an individual glacier with the maximal number of footprints (7) in the track is equal to − 1  m/year; on average for 7  corrie-valley glaciers with northern/north-eastern exposition, it is − 1. 3  m/year in the ablation zone.

Maximum values of accumulation rate were found at both the equinoxes.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to estimate the}} South Cascade Glacier summer mass balance derived from remote sensing and GIS is evaluated by comparison to a traditional field-calculated mass balance measurement. The process of transforming surficial snow into glacial ice occurs at various rates throughout the glacier surface, creating zones of accumulation (firn) and ablation (ice), visibly appearing on the glacier as the <b>firn</b> <b>line.</b> Glacial firn and ice have a unique spectral signature that can be discriminated from IKONOS and WorldView- 1 satellite imagery and used to estimate an accumulation area ratio (AAR). This technique was evaluated using an established relationship between the South Cascade Glacier AAR in 2004 and a known field-calculated mass balance of the same year. The mass balance in a subsequent year (2008) was then estimated from the satellite image. Results for the summer mass balance in 2008 estimated from satellite imagery were - 3. 81 mWE; results from field-calculated measurement were - 3. 51 mWE. The resulting error of 8. 66 % was predominantly due to shadows cast on to the glacier surface from adjacent outcrops and rocks {{on the surface of}} the glacier. This method produced a measurement that estimates mass balance using a ratio between pixels of glacial firn and ice more efficient relative to field-calculated data.

At these levels the presence or abse. nce of galactose I or glucose I from the lipopolysacch-aride core made a considerable difference. A heptose-less rfaE mutant was the most sensitive of the strains tested to the above named antibiotics.

Modern terminal and lateral moraines near glacier snouts were used to reconstruct former outlines during the end of the Little Ice Age (middle of XIX century). Also SRTM data and GPS-surveys in Munku-Sardyk area were applied to measure glacier altitudes. GIS technologies allowed forming digital glacier data base with attribute information and new inventory was made. Totally 13 glaciers with area of 5. 1 km² were investigated and mapped. Glaciers are located in vertical range from 2800 – 3490 m a. s. l. (Munku-Sardyk area) and 2340 – 2950 m a. s. l. (Topographov area). <b>Firn</b> <b>line</b> on glaciers vary from 2540 to 3110 m a. s. l., rising to the southeast.

Analysis of regional climate data shows that the rate of deglaciation is well correlated with summer temperatures increasing {{in the second half of}} XX century, especially in 1980 – 1990 s.

40|$|In this {{research}} project we use satellite measurements to infer the mean specific mass balance (Bm) of glaciers. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Europe, {{is being used}} as a test-case because this ice cap has often been studied. Only one aspect of Vatnajökull has not been investigated so far, and that is the relation between its mass balance and climatological conditions. We therefore also construct a mass balance model, the results of which can be compared to the satellite images. On Vatnajökull an extensive meteorological experiment took place in the summer of 1996, and the dataset collected during this experiment can be used for validation of the model. The mass balance model is calibrated with in situ measurements. We find that the incoming longwave radiation is best modeled as a function of meteorological variables in the free atmosphere just above the relatively thin katabatic layer. Also, the ratio of changes in the 2 m temperature to changes in the free atmospheric temperature (the climate sensitivity) is smaller than 1. Horizontal precipitation gradients over Vatnajökull are large, which results in a strongly varying sensitivity to external temperature changes over the ice cap. Local climatic conditions thus highly determine the mass balance and its sensitivity. From the mass balance model we construct a Seasonal Sensitivity Characteristic (SSC) of Vatnajökull, which consists of the sensitivity of Bm to monthly perturbations in temperature and precipitation. Temperature sensitivities are high in summer and nearly zero in winter, while precipitation sensitivities are high in winter and low in summer. With the SSC we reconstruct the mass balance of Vatnajökull since 1825. The results for two Icelandic glaciers correlate very well with mass balance records that are extracted from length records with a linear inverse model. For the south of Vatnajökull we find that after 1900, the length record is well explained by temperature variations alone, while another Icelandic glacier (S¢lheimajökull) was also influenced by precipitation variations. Equilibrium Line Elevation {{at the end of the}} melting season (ELAe) is a proxy for Bm, but the Equilibrium Line (EL) is mostly not visible on AVHRR images when it is located above its position of the previous year(s). EL detection is further hindered by clouds and a gradual transition between ice and firn or snow. Consequently, detection of the ELAe on albedo images is not particularly useful for estimating Bm. Instead, we propose to study the mean albedo of the entire ice cap throughout the melting season, so that all available information about the surface albedo is taken into account. The mean net potential global radiation, which can be estimated from the mean surface albedo alone, is found to relate linearly to Bm. Like AVHRR images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images only display the surface <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> as a distinct boundary and not the snow line (i. e. melting snow and firn have the same backscatter and albedo signatures). On the other hand, winter SAR images of Vatnajökull display sub-surface firn-ice transitions, but these do not correspond to the late summer surface <b>firn</b> <b>line.</b> Unlike albedo images, SAR images do not display inter-annual variations of the signal within the accumulation area that are clearly related to Bm and are therefore less usefull for mass balance retrieval. For the north-western part of Vatnajökull the indirect observations (satellite and modelled) correspond with the direct (in situ) observations. Only for one year the different estimates strongly diverge, probably due to a lack of satellite images and an erroneously modeled distribution of precipitation. We compute the best estimate of the mass balance of north-western Vatnajökull as the weighted mean of the individual estimates. For the part of Vatnajökull where the mass balance has not been measured, we can use the indirect methods to estimate relative variations in Bm...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Greenland ice sheet {{is treated as}} a monomineralic rock formation, primarily metamorphic, but with a sedimentary veneer of snow and firn. This sedimentary member is perennial above the <b>firn</b> <b>line,</b> and the classical methods of stratigraphy and sedimentation can be profitably applied to it. During a 4 -year period 146 pit studies and 288 supplementary Rammsonde profiles were made along 1100 miles of over-snow traverse (Fig. 1). Temperature, density, ram hardness, and grain size were measured in the strata exposed in each pit. Stratification of snow results from variations in the conditions of deposition and is emphasized by subsequent diagenesis. Summer layers are coarser-grained and have generally lower density and hardness values than winter layers; they may also show evidence of surface melt. The onset of fall is usually identified by an abrupt increase in density and hardness accompanied by a decrease in grain size. This stratigraphic discontinuity is used as the annual reference plane. Strata in the upper 10 to 20 meters compose a succession of annual sequences which are preserved in recognizable form for at least several decades. Correlation of annual layers between pits, spaced 10 to 25 miles apart along the traverse of Figure 1, gives a picture of annual accumulation during the past 5 to 20 years for western Greenland between 69 and 77 °N. The control established by these data, together with information from earlier expeditions (primarily those of Koch-Wegener and DeQuervain) and from permanent coastal meteorological stations, {{have been used to}} make a map showing the distribution of gross annual accumulation, essentially the equivalent of annual precipitation, for the entire ice sheet (Fig. 30). In general, the accumulation contours follow the north-south trend of the coast lines, with extremes of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the northeast and more than 90 cm H 2 O per year in the south; the average for the ice sheet is 34 cm H 2 O per year. The zone of maximum precipitation lies close to the coast in two regions, one on the east coast between Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, the other on the west coast between Upernavik and Thule. In addition to the existence of a useful stratigraphic record four diagenetic facies are recognized on the ice sheet. (1) The ablation facies extends from the outer edge, or terminus, of the glacier to the <b>firn</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> is the highest elevation to which the annual snow cover recedes during the melt season. (2) The soaked facies becomes wet throughout during the melting season and extents from the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> to the saturation line, i. e., the uppermost limit of complete wetting. The saturation line is the highest altitude at which the 0 °C isothermal surface penetrates to the melt surface of the previous summer. (3) The percolation facies is subjected to localized percolation of melt water from the surface without becoming wet throughout. Percolation can occur in snow and firn of sub-freezing temperatures with only the pipe-like percolation channels being at the melting point. A network of ice glands, lenses, and layers forms when refreezing occurs. This facies extends from the saturation line to the upper limit of surface melting, the dry-snow line. Negligible soaking and percolation occur above the dry-snow line. (4) The dry-snow facies includes all of the glacier lying above the dry-snow line, and negligible melting occurs in it. The saturation line can be identified by discontinuities in temperature, density, and ram hardness data, and it may also be located by examination of melt evidence in strata exposed on pit walls. It is as sharply defined as the firn line; but the dry-snow line, although determined by the same methods, is an ill-defined transition zone 10 - to 20 -miles wide. The facies represent a response to climate, therefore changes in the location of facies boundaries may be used as indicators of secular climatic change. Since facies are not restricted to the Greenland ice sheet, they provide the basis for a general classification of glaciers. This "facies classification" is areal in nature and gives a greater resolution of characteristics than Ahlmann's "geophysical classification. " In particular, the "facies classification" permits subdivision of large glaciers which span the entire range of environments from temperate to polar. Ahlmann's useful distinction between temperate and polar glaciers takes on new meaning in the light of glacier facies. Thus, a temperate glacier exhibits only the two facies below the saturation line whereas {{one or both of the}} facies above the saturation line are present on polar glaciers. An attempt has been made to map the distribution of facies on the Greenland ice sheet (Fig. 48). The distribution of mean annual temperature on the ice sheet may be approximated by gradients with respect to altitude and latitude of 1 °C/ 100 m and 1 °C per degree latitude respectively. The altitude gradient is controlled by strong outgoing radiation, producing deep inversions and katabatic winds. The katabatic winds are warmed adiabatically as they descend along the surface of the ice sheets and this is the primary control determining the temperature gradient along the snow surface. The latitude gradient is based on temperature measurements made above 2000 m on the ice sheets and on average values from meteorological stations spanning 20 ° of latitude on the west coast. A contour map of isotherms based on these gradients compares well with temperature values obtained from pits on the ice sheet. (Fig. 40). The densification of snow and firn is discussed for the case where melting is negligible. The assumption is that accumulation remains constant at a given location and, under this assumption, the depth-density curve is invariant with time as stated by Sorge's law. As a layer is buried it moves through a pressure gradient under steady-state conditions, and it is assumed that the decrease in pore space with increasing load is simply proportional to the pore spaces, i. e., [ [...] . ] where [ [...] . ] = specific volume of firn ([ [...] . ] = firn density), [ [...] . ] = specific volume of ice = 1. 09 cm 3 /g, [ [...] . ] = load at depth z below the snow surface and m = a constant which depends on the mechanism of densification. The depth-density equation obtained from equation 8 is [ [...] . ] where K = [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ] = void ratio for snow of density [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ] = density of snow when [ [...] . ] = 0. The consequences of the assumption in equation 8 compare favorably with observation. A fundamental change in the mechanism of densification is recognized within 10 m of the snow surface. The concept of a "critical density" is introduced. Before the density of snow attains the critical value it is compacted primarily by packing of the grains. The critical density represents the maximum value obtainable by packing and further compaction must proceed by other mechanisms. The rate of change of volume with increasing load decreases by a factor of 4 when the critical density is exceeded. The same equations hold in the case where melt is not negligible but the rates of densification are higher. Bauer's (1955) estimate for the balance of the ice sheet is revised. Two corrections are applied: (1) the average annual accumulation value of 31 cm H 2 O originally estimated by Loewe (1936) is revised to 34 cm H 2 O as a result of this study; (2) the relative areas of ablation and accumulation zones in Greenland north of 76 °N are more accurately defined. The net result is a slightly positive balance which is interpreted to mean that the Greenland ice sheet is essentially in equilibrium with present day climate...|$|E

The altitude of the equilibrium line can be calculated from the glacier morphology by the Kurovsky method, or simply as the average height of its terminus and upper reaches. Glaciers are subdivided into groups, including those of different morphology and exposure and the area-weighted average height of the equilibrium line Z e q u is computed for each group. The number of glaciers in each group is: 5 to 6 glaciers in Siberia and the Arctic and 10 to 15 glaciers in the mountains in the southern USSR. The map of contour lines of {{the height of}} the equilibrium line on glaciers is obtained from such data for the groups of glaciers.

40|$|Glaciation of the Chikhachev ridge (South-Eastern Altai) remains poorly known: field {{observations}} were not performed since the mid-twentieth century, available schemes and {{estimates of the}} glaciation and its scale {{made on the basis}} of remote sensing cover only a part of the glaciers, reconstructions of the Little Ice Age (LIA) glaciations are absent. This research was based on interpretation of the satellite images: Landsat- 4 (1989), Landsat- 7 (2001), and Spot- 5 (2011), as well as with the use of data of the field season of 2015. Characteristics of glaciations of the Chikhachev ridge as the whole and of its individual centers (Talduair massif, Mongun-Taiga-Minor massif, and southern part of the Chikhachev ridge) were determined for the first time. Recent glaciation is represented by 7  glaciers with their total area of 1. 12  km 2 in the Talduair massif, by 5  glaciers with total area of 0. 75  km 2 in the Mongun-Taiga-Minor massif, and by 85  glaciers with total area of 29  km 2 in the southern part of the Chikhachev ridge. Since the LIA maximum, areas of glaciers decreased by 61 % in the Talduair massif, by 74 % in the Mongun-Taiga-Minor massif, by 56 % in the southern part of the Chikhachev ridge with simultaneous lifting of the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> by 50  m, 65  m, and 70  m, respectively. The largest rates of the glacier contractions were determined for the period 1989 – 2011. Different mechanisms of the glacier retreats were shown by the example of the glacier complexes Burgastyn-Gol (one-sided retreat and disintegration) and the Grigorjev glacier (gradual retreat of the tongue). Retreat of the Grigorjev glacier has been reconstructed for the period from the LIA maximum until 2015. Average rate of the retreat increased from 1, 6  m/year in 1957 – 1989 up to 11, 3  m/year in 2011 – 2015. The present-day scales of the glaciers and rates of their retreating do not significantly differ from estimations made by other researchers for the nearest centers of glaciation of the Altai arid part. Stabilization of the temperature against the background of increasing precipitation suggests that in future retreating of small glaciers will slow down. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Folgefonna, three large maritime ice masses in Hardanger, Western Norway has been assessed {{over the last}} 150 years {{using a variety of}} remote sensing datasets (optical and microwave satellite images, aerial photography, digital elevation models (DEMs) and old maps). Changes in glacier area, volume and elevation of the transient snowline (TSL), a commonly used glacier mass balance proxy are determined. All three parameters show a similar trend, although the scarcity of glacier volume data points means that changes cannot be resolved in as much detail as the measurements of glacier area or the TSL elevation. Since the Little Ice Age (LIA) maxima {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century Folgefonna has been retreating and losing mass with noticeable glacier advances in the 1960 s/ 70 s and the 1990 s. Since the turn of the millennium Folgefonna has retreated rapidly interrupted only by a short lived advance between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 Nordfonna, Midtfonna and Sørfonna had respective areas of 24. 8 km², 9. 1 km² and 156. 7 km², reductions of 47 %, 68 % and 20 % compared with their LIA maxima sizes in 1860. The TSL mirrors this trend albeit with less magnitude compared with the other observations, it is therefore assumed that in actual fact it the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> being measured and not the TSL. Absolute ice volume calculations are only possible for Nordfonna where the subglacial topography is known; Nordfonna measured 1. 84 km³ in 2010, a reduction of 43 % of its 1937 volume. If planar bedrock surfaces beneath 95 % of the ice surfaces are assumed then rudimentary percentage losses can be calculated. Over the same time span Midtfonna lost 1441 million kg (50 %) of mass, while Sørfonna lost 8268 million kg (18 %) between 1987 and 2010, the portion of Sørfonna visible on the 1937 topographic map lost 5658 million kg (21 %) between then and 2010. The changes observed remotely in Folgefonna relate well to the in-situ data as well as the climatic data, it is evident that winter precipitation has traditionally been the principle driver of Folgefonna, however recent increases in summer temperature have been responsible for the acceleration in glacier shrinkage. Folgefonna is found to have advanced and retreated roughly in synchronisation with ice masses in Scandinavia, Europe and further afield suggesting that a global force is partly responsible for driving the glacier...|$|E
40|$|Glacierization of {{southern}} {{slope of the}} Dzhungarian (Zhetysu) Alatau range was estimated by means of data obtained by operational satellite Landsat 7 surveys on August 19 and September 2011 (sensors ETM+) {{with the use of}} digital relief models (ASTER GDEM). Analysis of these materials by means of computer programs ENVI, ERDAS Imagine, MapInfo, and ArcGIS made it possible to obtain a spatial information of glacier systems of the territory under investigation and to define morphological characteristics of glaciers, present-day moraine complexes, glacier lakes as well as other elements of glacial monitoring at the survey moments. To estimate changes of the glacierization the data from previous Inventories of this glacier system as of 1956 and 1972 (P. A. Cherkasov), 1990 and 2000 (authors of this article) were used. 30 glaciers being now located on the Chine territory but included into the Inventories of 1956 and 1972 (because the boundaries were changed after 1990) were included into new Inventory. As of 2011, 500 glaciers with total area of their open parts 120. 12 km 2 were registered in Southern Dzhungaria. 124 glaciers (57 % of total number) cover area less 0. 1 km 2 each, and their total area is equal to 9. 01 km 2 (8 % of total area of the glacierization). Total area of the moraines reached 105. 6 km 2. Volume of open ice calculated by formulas was estimated 4. 6 km 3. According to calculations, the <b>firn</b> <b>line</b> altitude of the glaciers on the southern slope was equal to 3685 m. As compared to 1956 (3645 m) this line lifted by 40 m. 190 glacier lakes with total area 6. 0 km 2 were found on this territory, among them 19 lakes were classified as especially dangerous for outbursting (their total area – 2. 5 km 2). For the last 55 years the glacierization area in the Southern Dzhungaria was reduced by 47. 4 % or, on the average, by 0. 86 % in every year. It should be noted that for the several last years, the rate of degradation decreased almost twice as compared to earlier years. The tendencies revealed were used to predict future changes of the glaciarization area on southern slope of the Dzhungarian Alatau range by the end of current century. According to this prediction, if the climatic conditions will not change, glaciers of this region will possibly be existing, however, their area will amount not more than 24 % of the glacierization area of 1956. </p...|$|E
