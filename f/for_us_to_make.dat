25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live." ...|$|E

The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes. Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, [...] "It's easy <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging". Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station's Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility. A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland. Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge. Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.|$|E

500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I would do anything <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News. He criticised the song for replicating the structure and lyrical content of [...] "Someone Like You", a song performed by English singer-songwriter Adele: ...|$|E

Wikileaks refused to remove the material, and its operator released {{a statement saying that}} Scientology was a [...] "cult" [...] that [...] "aids and abets a general climate of Western media self-censorship." [...] A Church of Scientology International spokeswoman, writing to FOXNews.com, said: [...] "I can only assume that religious bigotry and prejudice is driving their activity, as there is no altruistic value in posting our copyrighted scriptures, despite Wikileaks' statements to the contrary. Posting entire books and hundreds of pages of published works is not 'Sunshine Policy' but wholesale copyright infringement." [...] Julian Assange replied: [...] "We thought it was a small issue, and our normal fare is government corruption and military secrets, so it seemed that this nutty religious organization was pretty inconsequential {{in terms of what we}} normally do.

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
