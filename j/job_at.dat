40|$|Using data on German and Swedish {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs), {{this paper}} analyses determinants of international location choice {{and the degree}} of substitutability of labour across locations. Countries with highly skilled labour forces strongly attract German but not necessarily Swedish MNEs. In MNEs from either country, affiliate employment tends to substitute for employment at the parent firm. At the margin, substitutability is the strongest with respect to affiliate employment in Western Europe. A 1 % larger wage gap between Germany and locations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is associated with 900 fewer <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> German parents and 5, 000 more <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> affiliates in CEE. A 1 % larger wage gap between Sweden and CEE is associated with 140 fewer <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> Swedish parents and 260 more <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> affiliates in CEE. labour demand; location choice; multinational enterprises; multinominial choice; translog cost function...|$|R
