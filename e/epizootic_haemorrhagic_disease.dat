Vet. arhiv 74, 63 - 83, 2004. <b>Epizootic</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> virus (EHDV), {{a member of}} the Orbivirus genus in the family Reoviridae, is related to bluetongue virus (BTV) and Palyam serogroup of orbiviruses. The EHDV infects domestic and wild ruminants {{in many parts of the}} world. Ten serotypes of EHDV designated (EHDV- 1 through EHDV- 10) are recognized worldwide. Currently, there is little information about the epidemiology of EHDV serogroup of orbiviruses. Cattle are susceptible to EHDV infection, but the disease is usually subclinical. Whereas the disease is fatal in North American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), no information is available about the disease in African deer populations. Unfamiliarity with the ecology, biology and molecular epidemiology of EHDV serogroup has led to major barriers in international trade of livestock and associated germplasm.

40|$|More {{than two}} thirds of {{emerging}} viruses are of zoonotic origin, and among them RNA viruses represent the majority. Ceratopogonidae (genus Culicoides) are well-known vectors of several viruses responsible for epizooties (bluetongue, <b>epizootic</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease,</b> etc.). They are also vectors of the only known virus infecting humans: the Oropouche virus. Female midges usually feed {{on a variety of}} hosts, leading to possible transmission of emerging viruses from animals to humans. In this context, we report here the analysis of RNA viral communities of Senegalese biting midges using next-generation sequencing techniques as a preliminary step toward the identification of potential viral biohazards. Sequencing of the RNA virome of three pools of Culicoides revealed the presence of a significant diversity of viruses infecting plants, insects and mammals. Several novel viruses were detected, including a novel Thogotovirus species, related but genetically distant from previously described tick-borne thogotoviruses. Novel rhabdoviruses were also detected, possibly constituting a novel Rhabdoviridae genus, and putatively restricted to insects.

Theron} H. Hu ismans 2 and L. H. NeP* Departments of 1 Microbiology and Plant Pathology and 2 Genetics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa The role that a conserved amino acid motif, found in the non-structural protein NS 2 of orbiviruses, plays in the interaction of this protein with single stranded (ss) RNA was investigated by mutation analysis of the NS 2 of <b>epizootic</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> virus. An NS 2 mutant in which this motif (amino acids 75 to 83) was deleted was expressed inSpodopterafrugiperda cells by a recombinant baculovirus and found to be unable to bind to poly(U) -Sepharose. The deletion mutant also differed from wild-type NS 2 in {{that it did not}} appear to be complexed with ssRNA in cells infected with the baculovirus recom-binant. Furthermore, the deletion exerted an adverse effect on the ability of NS 2 to form inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of baculovirus-infected insect cells. To further characterize the role of this motif in RNA-binding, specific residues within the region were sub-stituted by site-directed mutagenesis and the mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins. Analysis of the different mutant proteins indicated that in each case ssRNA-binding was impaired relative to that of the wild-type NS 2 control. The degree of impairment corresponded to the number of amino acid substitutions and the largest effects were associated with non-conserved substitutions. It is suggested that the conserved motif is an important structural determinant in the interaction of NS 2 with ssRNA...|$|E

A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to identify serum antibodies against BTV and EHDV across three rainy seasons. The median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV antibodies in cattle was 62 % (interquartile range [IQR]: 30 – 89) and 56 % (IQR: 5 – 77), respectively. In sheep, the median sero-prevalence of BTV and EHDV was 41 % (IQR: 19 – 63) and 0 % (IQR: 0 – 21), respectively. Median sero-incidences of BTV and EHDV antibodies in cattle of 43 % (IQR: 22 – 67) and 27 % (IQR: 9 – 57) respectively were recorded. The median sero-incidence of BTV in sheep was 14 % (IQR: 6 – 23). Based on these preliminary findings, animal health workers in Zimbabwe should continue to monitor the exposure rates of cattle and sheep to BTV and consider the possibility of strains emerging with increased pathogenicity. There are no previous published reports of antibodies against EHDV in Zimbabwe so the possibility of <b>epizootic</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> existing in domestic livestock should now be considered by Zimbabwean animal health officials. Seroconversions to BTV and EHDV occurred predominantly {{at the end of}} each rainy season (March and April), which generally corresponds to high numbers of the Culicoides vectors.
