5|$|The exact {{placement}} of the genus Triceratops within the ceratopsid <b>group</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> debated by paleontologists. Two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, are considered valid, although many other species have been named. Research published in 2010 suggested that the contemporaneous Torosaurus, a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents Triceratops in its mature form. The view was immediately disputed. Retrieved July 29, 2013 from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17192624 and examination of more fossil evidence is expected to settle the debate.|$|E

5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a colleague, who {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the <b>Group</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|Opeth is a Swedish {{heavy metal}} band from Stockholm, formed in 1989. The <b>group</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> through several {{personnel}} changes, but lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, {{as well as}} strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the <b>group</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} <b>group,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E
5|$|The Fab Five, the 1991 {{recruiting}} {{class of}} five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having {{gone to the}} championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited. Although Webber was {{the only member of}} the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole <b>group</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream, which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.|$|E
