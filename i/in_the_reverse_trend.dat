40|$|Background Epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{is associated}} with downregulated E-cadherin and frequently with decreased proliferation. Proliferation may be restored in secondary metastases by mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We tested whether E-cadherin maintains epithelial proliferation in MDA-MB- 468 breast cancer cells, facilitating metastatic colonization in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Methods EMT/MET markers were assessed in xenograft tumors by immunohistochemistry. Stable E-cadherin manipulation was effected by transfection and verified by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Effects of E-cadherin manipulation on proliferation and chemomigration were assessed in vitro by performing sulforhodamine B assays and Transwell assays, respectively. Invasion was assessed by Matrigel outgrowth; growth in vivo was assessed in SCID mice; and EMT status was assessed by qPCR. Hypoxic response of E-cadherin knockdown cell lines was assessed by qPCR after hypoxic culture. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), one- and two-way ANOVA with posttests, and paired Student’s t tests were performed to determine significance (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Results EMT occurred at the necrotic interface of MDA-MB- 468 xenografts in regions of hypoxia. Extratumoral deposits (vascular and lymphatic inclusions, local and axillary nodes, and lung metastases) strongly expressed E-cadherin. MDA-MB- 468 cells overexpressing E-cadherin were more proliferative and less migratory in vitro, whereas E-cadherin knockdown (short hairpin CDH 1 [shCDH 1]) cells were more migratory and invasive, less proliferative, and took longer to form tumors. shCDH 1 -MDA-MB- 468 xenografts did not contain the hypoxia-induced necrotic areas observed in wild-type (WT) and shSCR-MDA-MB- 468 tumors, {{but they did not}} exhibit an impaired hypoxic response in vitro. Although vimentin expression was not stimulated by E-cadherin knockdown in 2 D or 3 D cultures, xenografts of these cells were globally vimentin-positive rather than exhibiting regional EMT, and they expressed higher SNA 1 than their in vitro counterparts. E-cadherin suppression caused a trend toward reduced lung metastasis, whereas E-cadherin overexpression resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>trend,</b> consistent with the increased proliferation rate and predominantly epithelial phenotype of MDA-MB- 468 cells outside the primary xenograft. This was also originally observed in WT xenografts. Furthermore, we found that patients with breast cancer that expressed E-cadherin {{were more likely to have}} metastases. Conclusions E-cadherin expression promotes growth of primary breast tumors and conceivably the formation of metastases, supporting a role for MET in metastasis. E-cadherin needs to be reevaluated as a tumor suppressor...|$|E

We remedy these problems by developing a matched employee-employer database linking the Decennial Household Census (individual worker records) and the Longitudinal Research Database (individual manufacturing establishment records) for the Los Angeles CMSA in 1990 and 2000. Our results show that trade has a significant impact on wage inequality, pushing down the wages of the less-skilled while allowing more highly skilled workers to benefit from exports.

40|$|Abstract: Although {{buildings}} {{account for}} roughly 40 percent of energy consumption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, very few policies {{to increase the}} energy efficiency of existing buildings are in effect today. This article looks {{to the case of}} Germany as an instructive example of how mandates can be employed to improve the energy efficiency of existing residential buildings. Based on interviews with government officials at federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as building contractors, architects, and energy consultants, I find that – contrary to concerns frequently voiced by American policy-makers – mandates for energy efficiency in existing buildings do not necessarily entail heavy-handed government intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building sector. On the contrary, much of <b>the</b> success <b>in</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> of increasing building energy consumption in Germany can be ascribed to a vibrant private sector response to the new market opportunities created by mandates.

Misconceptions about what CS is {{and a lack of}} understanding regarding its many socially relevant applications creates negative associations during this crucial time. These negative associations can result later in many women students not picking the math and science classes that would prepare them for a CS career, ultimately lowering CS enrollment. Our recruitment software explains in an entertaining way what CS is and showcases its social relevancy through a series of highly visual, interactive games & puzzles and illustrates CS alumni careers. Due to working with very young students, only their immediate reaction to the software can be gauged and its overall impact cannot be measured until they are of college going age in another 7 - 10 years...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} trends and differences in active sports participation and in club membership <b>in</b> Flanders and <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>In</b> both countries, time-trend data exist on the topic of leisure-time involvement in sports activities. During the previous decade, sports participation rates have increased in Flanders as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>in</b> Flanders, <b>the</b> involvement <b>in</b> sports slightly decreased among the younger population, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands little to no growth can be detected (among the young people). With regard to club membership, in Flanders club membership increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands a <b>reverse</b> <b>trend</b> can be detected. As sports participation differences according to age and gender are generally greater in Flanders than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, it seems that a process of democratization has started earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands than <b>in</b> Flanders. Still, despite Sports for All policies in both countries, differences in sports participation across educational level and socio-economic status pertain in both countries. Comparison of international data, from Sport England and from the Compass project, show that the Low Countries are not an exception in this regard. Above all, though, the present comparison raises the need for good longitudinal data on sports participation, especially better cross-national research using international standards...|$|R
