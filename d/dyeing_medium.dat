40|$|Freshwater is an {{increasingly}} scare resource that is extensively used in textile wet-processing. In seeking to identify alternative low freshwater usage coloration technology {{this study examined}} the potential use of seawater (SEAW) as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium</b> for wool coloration using a range of reactive dyes. Initially the dyeing behaviour of the wool fabric in simulated seawater (SSW) was compared against conventional dyeing from distilled water (W) using alpha-bromoacrylamide-based Lanasol dyes and sulphatoethylsulphone-based Remazol dyes. These preliminary studies demonstrated that comparable coloration performance could be acheived in the SSW medium based on the assessment of the dye exhaustion, dye fixation, colour yiel and levelness. Subsequent 'real' seawater dyeing studies of wool, using Mauritian seawater, with the lanasol and Remazol reactive dyes again confirmed that comparable coloration performance, based on the dye exhaustion, dye fixation, colour yield and levelness, could be achieved, highlighting again the potential for substituting freshwater with much more plentiful seawater as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium...</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of time, the dyeing {{industry}} {{has become one of}} the greater polluters of water worldwide. The sheer volume of water and the high concentration of additives used in textile colouration are staggering, which have already caused unrepairable damage to environment and continue to directly impact on the sustainability of textile colouration industry. “Supercritical CO 2 dyeing” uses supercritical CO 2 as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium,</b> enabling the reduction and even elimination of the creation of textile colouration wastewater. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) has a low critical point and is non-flammable. It can be recycled, providing a promising environmentally friendly substitute for aqueous media. Reactive disperse dyes that have both reactivity towards natural fabrics and high solubility in scCO 2 would offer great promise for colouring natural fabrics. In this study, the isocyanate group, as a reactive group, was introduced to disperse dyes to create reactive disperse dyes suitable for supercritical dyeing. Thus, a series of reactive disperse dyes, containing both isocyanate groups and alkyl groups were successfully synthesised. Dyeing experiments under different dyeing conditions were performed to establish the optimal dyeing conditions for these synthesised dyes. A new synthesis route was developed to create an azo-based disperse reactive dye containing the vinyl sulphonyl reactive group, which was used to dye natural fibres using scCO 2 as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium.</b> Using relatively moderate, optimal conditions in the scCO 2 dyeing processes, uniform dyeing with high colour strength and fastness properties that were similar to those from conventional aqueous dyeing were achieved on natural fabrics that were dyed with the synthesised dyes. Furthermore, there are opportunities to modify a wide range of disperse dyes following this synthesis route. ...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for computer color matching is proposed. In {{contrast to the}} existing computer color matching processes, this approach does not need the database of colorants with their absorption and scattering coefficients in order to predict the dyeing recipe and correct it. Despite various factors of the color device, dyes, <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium,</b> and dyeing conditions, the color can be corrected using this algorithm based on available color information of the sample and its real time output. The basic aim has been to predict recipe for reproducing desired color by using only three primary subtractive colors: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow, {{then be able to}} correct it dynamically for a reproduction close to the target. This generic process has other applications too, like displaying the same color across different monitors, or reproducing color from a sample to print...|$|E
40|$|Wool pretreated with {{dimethyl}} sulfoxide (DMSO) was characterized and its dyeing behavior in non-aqueous green solvents was investigated. Reactive dyeing of wool in deep shades is challenging because the mandatory alkaline aftertreatment {{to match the}} fastness of mordant dyes inevitably causes damage to wool keratin. The current study showed that the colorfastness-integrity dilemma could be solved by replacing water with organic solvents as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium.</b> Covalent fixation is predominantly favored in solvent dyeing so that excellent colorfastness is achievable at any given shade without alkali aftertreatment. Compared with aqueous dyeing, solvent dyeing was found to give 30 % higher covalent fixation on average, which translated to better colorfastness (0. 5 – 1 grade) at higher color depth (ΔK/S = 1. 3 – 4. 9). In addition, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy results indicated that DMSO pretreatment induced morphological and structural changes of wool in favor of dyeability. The findings are crucial to the phasing-out of metal-containing dyes for eco-friendly wool dyeing...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{this work}} to {{increase}} the efficiency of the conventional dyeing process using ultrasonics or to replace the conventional <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium</b> water with supercritical carbon dioxide, saving water and energy costs to realize an ecological and also an economical profit. Using ultrasonics (approx. 10 W/cm 2) in a conventional dyeing process leads to a faster dyestuff consumption of the wool fibre, a deeper depht of shade and higfher levelness. The influence of the ultrasonic waves lead to a fester penetration of the wool fibre surface but no faster diffusion inside the fibre. No kind of ultrasonic-induced fibre damage could be detected. It could also be shown {{that it is possible to}} dye wool in deep shades and with high levelness and fastness properties in a water-free dyeing process using supercritical carbon dioxide instead of water. To match the fastness standards of today it is necessary to use fiber-reactive disperse dyes or mordant dyes on a pre-mordanted wool fabric. Small amounts of modifier are inevitable for deep shades and high levelness. It is possible to recycle the modifier with the carbon dioxide. The water-free dyeing conditions allow higher dyeings temperatures up to 120 °C. Without any detectable wool fibre damage, this reduces the dyeing process for more than 30 %...|$|E

Dyeings were done with blue, red and yellow dyes and a dye mixture containing equal amounts of each of the three dyes. The spent dyebath water from these four dyeings was mixed, filtered and ozonated. The four shades were dyed again in baths containing 90 % ozonated water and 10 % fresh tap water. Only 10 % of the amount of salt used in the original dyeing was required for the dyeings in recycled water since the salt in the 90 % recycled water was still present. The experiment was repeated through five reuse cycles. Color reproducibility of dyeings done in the recycled water was excellent, closely matching the color attained using fresh tap water as the <b>dyeing</b> <b>medium.</b> The pH of the spent dyebath water decreased upon ozonation. Although the pH decrease was about the same in each new cycle, the amounts of caustic soda needed to adjust back to the original dyebath pH value increased with each cycle.

Indeed, in most macroscopic quantum systems, like liquid helium, ultracold atomic Bose gases, and exciton-polaritons, condensation and superfluidity occur in parallel. In photon Bose-Einstein condensates {{realized in the}} dye microcavity system, thermalization does not occur by direct interaction of the condensate particles as in the above described systems, i. e. photon-photon interactions, but by absorption and re-emission processes on the dye molecules, which act as a heat reservoir. Currently, there is no experimental evidence for superfluidity in the dye microcavity system, though effective photon interactions have been observed from thermo-optic effects in the <b>dye</b> <b>medium.</b> In this work, we theoretically investigate the implications of effective thermo-optic photon interactions, a temporally delayed and spatially non-local effect, on the photon condensate, and derive the resulting Bogoliubov excitation spectrum. The calculations suggest a linear photon dispersion at low momenta, fulfilling the Landau's criterion of superfluidity.

The best decolorizer, removing dye up to 90 Yo, within 2 days of incubation, was Enterobacter sp.

Its decolorizing activity was highly dependent upon the dye concentration, the presence or absence ofglucose and/or peptone and pH. Shaking/static and dark/light conditions had no discernable effects on the decolorization. Its degrading activity expressed by the presence of dye metabolites or aromatic amines was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometry at 200 - 400 nm. It was demonstrated that the dye removal by Enterobacler sp. was only partial and that it was associated with dye adsorption to cell mass and decolorization rather than further complete biodegradation of the aromatic amines.

40|$|The textile {{industry}} {{is the largest}} consumer of azo dyes and activated sludge treatment systems typically used to remove them are frequently inefficient, resulting in significant quantities of these compounds adsorbed in the sludge or released into water bodies. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the biodegradation of the commercial azo dye Disperse Red 1 in a pilot scale anaerobic-aerobic reactor inoculated by a microbial consortium selected for its capacity to degrade azo dyes. Dye decolorization (80 %) occurred in 60 h in the anaerobic reactor and 92 % COD (chemical oxygen demand) was removed as measured in the treated effluent. LC-ESI-MS/MS of the treated effluent showed the formation of a reduced azo bond and azo bond cleavage and subsequent degradation products. Aromatic amines produced by the cleavage of the azo bond were not detected. Toxicity tests performed with Daphnia similis and Hydra attenuate in the treated effluent showed that the toxicity was reduced significantly. Mutagenicity, evaluated using the Salmonella/microsome Ames test, found the untreated <b>dye</b> <b>medium</b> was only mutagenic toward Salmonella strain YG 1041. However after treatment, only marginal mutagenicity was observed.

The effect of various parameters such as catalyst dosage, concentration of <b>dye,</b> and <b>medium</b> on the photocatalytic degradation was examined. The activity of recovered TiO 2 /Pd and TiO 2 /Pt nanoparticles was studied.|$|R
