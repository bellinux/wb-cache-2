40|$|Galileo {{has been}} in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a temperature self-compensating, fiber, long-period grating (LPG) device is studied. This device consists of a single 325 -µm-period LPG recorded across two sections of a single-mode B-Ge-codoped fiber—one section bare and the other coated with a 1 -µm thickness of Ag. This structure generates two <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> associated with the eighth and ninth cladding modes, which are spectrally close together (~ 60 nm). The <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> associated with the Ag-coated section is unaffected by changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium {{and can be used}} to compensate for the temperature of the bare-fiber section. The sensor has a resolution of ± 1. 0 × 10 - 3 for the refractive index and ± 0. 3 °C for the temperature.

40|$|Long period {{gratings}} (LPGs) {{were written}} into a D-shaped optical fibre, {{which has an}} elliptical core with a W-shaped refractive index profile. The LPG's <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> {{were found to be}} sensitive to the polarisation of the interrogating light with a spectral separation of about 15 nm between the two orthogonal polarisation states. In addition, two spectrally overlapping <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> corresponding to orthogonal polarisation states were observed; modelling successfully reproduced this spectral feature. The spectral sensitivity of both orthogonal states was experimentally measured with respect to temperature, surrounding refractive index, and directional bending. These LPG devices produced blue and red wavelength shifts of the stop-bands due to bending in different directions. The measured spectral sensitivities to curvatures, d?/dR, ranged from - 3. 56 nm m to + 6. 51 nm m. The results obtained with these LPGs suggest that this type of fibre may be useful as a shape/bend sensor. It was also demonstrated that the neighbouring bands could be used to discriminate between temperature and bending and that overlapping orthogonal polarisation <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> can be used to minimise error associated with polarisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{acoustic}} attenuation in a condensing medium is investigated using a continuumlike formulation {{that allows for}} the phase-exchange process. The liquid phase is assumed sufficiently disperse so that the field may {{be treated as a}} continuum. The elementary relaxation processes associated with droplet velocity, temperature, and vapor pressure equilibration are equally important in determining the attenuation when vapor, liquid, and inert gas mass fractions are of the same order. When the liquid mass fraction is small, however, a strong <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> appears at low frequencies. This attenuation process involves a coupled relaxation process in which heat transfer and vaporization processes combine to change the temperature of the relatively large gas mass. This <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> (i) centers on a frequency that is proportional to the concentration of liquid, and (ii) has a maximum value that varies directly as the concentration of condensible vapor and roughly as the square of the latent heat of vaporization. When the concentrations of liquid and condensible vapor are both small, the low-frequency <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> is nearly isolated and may be described in a convenient analytical manner...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{comparative}} study of long-period gratings (LPGs) written in the standard Ge-doped fiber and in two different fluorine-doped fibers {{by means of the}} electric arc discharge (EAD) -based technique. Concerning Ge-doped fibers, {{we present a}}n assessment of the EAD procedure by fabricating relatively short LPGs with deep <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> (up to 32 dB) and trivial power losses. We also demonstrate the ability to manage the effect of the single EAD perturbation to select grating length, which in turn acts on the bandwidth of <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands,</b> without compromising depth. Furthermore, for the first time, we produced LPGs in F-doped fibers with <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> deeper than 30 dB, demonstrating the dependence of the spectra on the grating period. Finally, we illustrate a comparative experimental study on the sensitivity of LPGs fabricated in the standard and F-doped fibers with surrounding refractive index (SRI) and temperature changes. We proved that the SRI response of LPGs in F-doped fibers is significantly higher than in the standard fiber and it strongly depends on the type of F-doped fiber considered.

40|$|The Acoustic Black Hole (ABH) {{effect can}} be used to {{effectively}} reduce structural vibrations by trapping flexural waves in a thin-walled structure with a power-law thickness variation. In the present study, we used a wavelet-decomposed energy method to investigate an Euler-Bernoulli beam embedded with multiple ABHs. Broadband transmission <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> at relatively low frequencies are observed in a beam containing only a few ABH elements. To explain the underlying phenomena, an infinite structure with periodic ABH elements is analyzed. Numerical results show that the periodic boundary conditions in terms of displacement and rotational slope of a unit cell, based on the finite model, are sufficient to describe the band structures, without requiring full treatment of the entire infinite structure. This provides an efficient and flexible means to predict, and eventually optimize, the band structure based on a single element. Meanwhile, the ABH-induced locally resonant band gaps coincide with the <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands</b> observed in the finite beams. Because of the unique ABH feature, the proposed beam requires {{only a small number of}} elements to obtain broad <b>attenuation</b> <b>bands,</b> which offers great potential for vibrational isolation applications and wave filter designs in beam structures.

The capabilities of the RPWS experiment enable us to analyze the intensity extinction of HOM radiation, the so-called <b>attenuation</b> <b>band.</b> Using about 7 weeks of RPWS data obtained around the closest approach, a statistical analysis investigates the spectral variations of this phenomenon {{with respect to the}} spacecraft magnetic latitude and central meridian longitude. We show that the 'trace' of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> is usually not a full sinusoid as reported in previous studies and only parts of the curve are observed. Also, the intensity extinction can occur when the spacecraft is not in the planetary magnetic equator plane. This specific feature appears or vanishes when the observer (e. g., Cassini or Galileo spacecraft) is far from or close to the planet, respectively. The regular and systematic observations of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>band</b> suggest that the plasma medium at the origin of these features is steady and stable. The Io torus may be considered to be the most probable plasma medium where HOM emission is refracted through its raypath propagation. Furthermore, intensity extinction at frequencies higher than 3 MHz and up to 5 MHz implies the presence of particular electronic density irregularities in the Io torus. Volcanic activity, particularly in the northern hemisphere of the Io satellite, may be the source of such Io torus plasma irregularities...|$|R
