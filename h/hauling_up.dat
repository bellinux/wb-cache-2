25|$|Electrification {{was carried}} out in several smaller steps, with the first part from Oslo Ø to Ljan {{completed}} on 9 December 1936 and the last section from Sarpsborg to Halden, on 11 November 1940. NSB Class 66 was introduced as an express servie on the Østfold Line, running a round trip from Oslo to Halden each day, bringing travel time down to two hours. This lasted until 1956, when they were replaced with the slower NSB Class 65. The international trains were from 1948 served with the Swedish State Railways' SJ X5 units, able to run from Oslo to Copenhagen in less than ten hours. The fast service was named Skandiapilen. A landslide in 1953 washed away part of the track past Bekkelaget, resulting in the Bekkelaget Tunnel opening there five years later. The regional traffic received the new NSB Class 68 multiple units from the mid 1950s. A regular train with pyrite started running in 1966, <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> to 600,000 tonnes per year from Hjerkinn on the Dovre Line to Borregaard. They remained until the 1990s.|$|E

60|$|So {{saying he}} <b>hauled</b> <b>up</b> the dinghy that was towing behind the barge, {{and he and}} Dick rowed the two boys ashore. Then he walked along with them to a spot where several craft were <b>hauled</b> <b>up,</b> {{pointing}} out to them the differences in their rig and build, and explained their purpose, and gave them {{the names of the}} principal ropes and stays.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Joe Slag," [...] said Bob Massey, {{with sudden}} earnestness. [...] "I've never yet come in after a rescue without seein' the boat <b>hauled</b> <b>up</b> an' made snug. `Dooty first, an' {{pleasure}} arter,' that's bin my motto, as you know. But dooty lies {{in another direction}} this day, so you promise to see her <b>hauled</b> <b>up,</b> an' cleaned, an' properly housed, won't you?" ...|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} that set his active brain a-going once more--thereby {{overturning}} the weight of sorrow and causing the spring of his peculiar spirit to rebound--was {{the sight of the}} two pirates <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the boat and carrying off the oars.|$|E
60|$|Martin {{turned out}} with the rest, and tried to defy {{sickness}} for a time, {{but it would not}} do. The strong man was obliged to succumb to a stronger than he--not, however, until he had assisted as best as he could in <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the trawl.|$|E

6000|$|The conference being thus {{abruptly}} terminated, {{the skipper}} and mate of the Evening Star went on deck to give {{orders for the}} immediate <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> of the trawl and to [...] "have a squint" [...] at the steamer, which was seen at that moment like a little cloud on the horizon.|$|E
60|$|Now, when {{at length}} {{the weather had}} moderated, {{just as he was}} <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> his anchor, comes the Abbot of Blossholme, on whose will he had been bidden to wait, with a lean-faced monk and another passenger, said to be a sick religious, wrapped up in {{blankets}} and to all appearance dead.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as she}} {{had cleared}} the Irish coast a sullen gray-headed old wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her {{straight}} bows, {{and sat down on}} her steam-capstan used for <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the anchor.

60|$|There was a pause, and in {{a minute}} or two came two jerks, the signal to <b>haul</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{along the}} beach {{fishermen}} and crofters were hard at work <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> spars and barrels {{as fast as they}} were tossed ashore. None of them had seen any bodies, however, and they explained to us that only such things as could float had any chance of coming ashore, for the undercurrent was so strong that whatever was beneath the surface must infallibly be swept out to sea.|$|E
60|$|We cast {{loose the}} grapnel, lowered it and jerked it towards him. He swung past {{it like a}} pendulum, caught at it with one hand, and missed: came flying back on the {{receding}} curve, and missed again. At the third attempt he blundered right against it, and flung an arm {{over one of the}} flukes, next a leg, and in a trice we were <b>hauling</b> <b>up,</b> hand over hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ef dad was along," [...] said Dan, <b>hauling</b> <b>up,</b> [...] "he'd {{read the}} signs plain's print. The fish arc runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took baout as logy a halibut's we're apt {{to find this}} trip. Yesterday's catch--did ye notice it?--was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he'd read them signs right off. Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be read wrong er right. Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a simple}} and {{reliable}} instrument whose main disadvantage is that is must be <b>hauled</b> <b>up</b> to be read and reset after each measurement. Ekman solved this problem by designed a repeating current meter which could take up to forty-seven measurements before needing to be <b>hauled</b> <b>up</b> and reset. This device used a more complicated system of dropping small numbered metal balls at regular intervals to record the separate measurements.|$|R

6000|$|The music grew {{fuller and}} richer at every moment: other manly voices {{joined in the}} refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the boat had touched the beach, and the harsh grating of the shingle as the men dragged it up. I roused myself, and, after lending them a hand in <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> their boat, I lingered yet awhile to watch them {{disembark}} a goodly assortment of the hard-won 'treasures of the deep.' ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, Lumley and I {{gathered}} small {{branches and}} rekindled the Indians' fire, which had {{by that time}} almost gone out. Marcelle Dumont being professionally a forger of axes, and Henri Coppet, being an artificer in wood, went off to cut down trees for firewood; and Donald Bane with his friend set about cutting up and preparing the venison, while Blondin superintended and assisted Salamander and the others in landing the cargo, and <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the boat.|$|E
60|$|For, {{the time}} was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to {{conceive}} the idea of improving on his method, and <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. But, {{the time was}} not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.|$|E

60|$|It was now half-past nine. Lodloe arose {{and looked}} out over the pier. He could see nothing of the young mother. The freight was all on board, and they were <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the forward gang-plank. One or two belated {{passengers}} were hurrying along the pier; the bell was ringing; now the passengers were on board, the aft gang-plank was hauled in, the hawsers were cast off from the posts, the pilot's bell jingled, the wheels began to revolve, and the great steamboat slowly moved from its pier.|$|E
6000|$|They {{hurried to}} the spot, for both were {{suffering}} severely, and Arthur was scarcely able to speak. They found to their delight that Jack's surmise was a correct one, and <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> the rope a bucket full of water came to the surface. Arthur was about to seize it, when Jack said, [...] "You had better take this thing, Arthur; the natives might make a row if you drank from their bucket." [...] Arthur seized the half gourd that Jack had picked up, dipped it into the bucket, {{and handed it to}} Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cast off, lads," [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{as soon as}} {{on the deck of}} his own brig again, [...] "and four of you man that boat. We have got half of your treasure, Se¤or Wan, but have been driven from the rest of it, as you see. There is the bag; when at leisure we'll divide it, and give the people their share. Mr. Mulford, keep the brig in motion, <b>hauling</b> <b>up</b> toward the South Pass, while I go ashore for the ladies. I'll meet you just in the throat of the passage." ...|$|E
