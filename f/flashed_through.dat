500|$|In September 1936, Mickal played {{quarterback for}} the Centennial College All-Stars, a team {{composed}} of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things <b>flashed</b> <b>through</b> my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line but me. I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought about going to med school. I thought about possible brain damage." [...] He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7â€“6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.|$|E
