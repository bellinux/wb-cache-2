In 1986, he promulgated a World Constitution that, for the first time, brought the social governance of the worldwide Ismā'īlī community into a single structure with built-in flexibility to account for diverse circumstances of different regions. Served by volunteers appointed by and accountable to the Imām, the Constitution functions as an <b>enabler</b> to harness the best in individual creativity in an ethos of group responsibility to promote the common well-being.|$|E
25|$|BPR is {{different}} from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, {{by virtue of its}} aim for fundamental and radical change rather than iterative improvement. In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient. For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of information technology (IT) is conceived as a major contributing factor. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as <b>enabler</b> of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations.|$|E

25|$|From September 2007 to May 2008, {{elements}} of the battalion deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Slipper as part of RTF-3. The Security Task Group (STG) {{was made up of}} infantrymen from C Company 2 RAR, mortarmen and snipers from Support Company 2 RAR, IMV crews from 6 RAR and B Squadron, 3/4 Cavalry Regiment, cavalrymen from 2/14 LHR(QMI) and gunners from 4th Field Regiment. Elements from these units combined with {{elements of}} the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment to form a combat team. The role of the STG was to provide the firepower and mobility necessary to facilitate the engineers’ protected reconstruction. Intimately supported by Combat Engineers, Construction Engineers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians to make up Combat Team (CT) Spear, the STG was the fundamental <b>enabler</b> for the protected reconstruction effort.|$|E
25|$|Business {{strategy}} {{is the primary}} driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role. The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, {{and the distribution of}} work between them. Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of communication technology in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as <b>enabler</b> of new forms of organizing and collaborating, rather than supporting existing business functions. The people / human resources dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, motivation and reward systems. The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: Process ownership, customer focus, value adding, and cross-functionality.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to survival, the early colonists {{were expected to}} make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realized there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary <b>enabler</b> of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote as much time as the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.|$|E

The effects of illness script components -consequences and <b>enabling</b> conditions - and physician factors on referral decisions for gastrointestinal disorders were investigated. The hypothesis that consequences and <b>enabling</b> conditions {{increase the likelihood}} of referral was confirmed and several interactions between consequences and <b>enabling</b> conditions were found. The hypothesis that physician factors moderate the effect of <b>enabling</b> conditions was also confirmed, but (contrary to illness script theory) evidence was also found for moderation of consequences. Both <b>enabling</b> conditions and consequences were found to be moderated by physician factors to a larger extent than previously assumed by illness script theory...|$|R

500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied. Some women {{admired her}} strength and poise in private matters {{that were made}} public, some sympathized with her {{as a victim of}} her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an <b>enabler</b> to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met." ...|$|E
500|$|Wentz formed {{electronic}} duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The project released {{one single}} before album delays led to Rexha's departure in 2011. Black Cards added Spencer Peterson {{to complete the}} Use Your Disillusion EP in 2012. Wentz also completed writing a novel, Gray, {{that he had been}} working on for six years outside the band, and began hosting the reality tattoo competition show Best Ink. Hurley ventured farther into rock during the hiatus, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He continued to manage his record label, Fuck City, and drummed for bands Burning Empires and <b>Enabler.</b> He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. Despite this, the members all remained cordial to one another; Wentz was Stump's best man at his wedding. The hiatus was, all things considered, beneficial for the group and its members, according to Hurley. [...] "The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out," [...] he explained in 2013. [...] "Especially Joe and Patrick, who were so young. And Pete is a million times better." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, {{she also}} {{appeared}} in Don't Tempt Me, playing Carmen Ramos. The film received negative reviews. Jeff Vice of the Deseret News commented that [...] "unfortunately, casting Cruz as a tough girl is a hilariously bad [...] " [...] and Michael Miller of the Village Voice writing that [...] "as Satan's helper Carmen, Penélope Cruz doesn't hold a candle to her cocaine-huffing <b>enabler</b> in Blow". Cruz's last film in 2001 was Captain Corelli's Mandolin, film adaption of the novel of the same name. She played Pelagia, {{who falls in love}} with another man while her fiancé is in battle during the Second World War. Captain Corelli's Mandolin was not well received by critics, but made $62million worldwide. In 2002, she had a minor role in Waking Up in Reno. It had negative reviews and was a box office failure, making $267,000 worldwide. The following year, Cruz had a supporting role in the horror film Gothika, as Chloe Sava, a patient at a mental hospital. David Rooney of Variety wrote that Cruz [...] "adds a serviceably malevolent edge to Chole's apparent madness". Cruz's performance in Fanfan la Tulipe, also in 2003, was not well received, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commenting that Cruz [...] "deserves a special Cannes Razzie for a performance of purest teak".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the last}} two decades HSP90 has emerged as an {{intriguing}} target in the war on cancer. [...] HSP90 interacts and supports numerous proteins that promote oncogenesis, thus distinguishing Hsp90 as a cancer <b>enabler</b> as it is regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression. [...] Moreover, through their extensive interactomes, both paralogs are associated with each hallmark of cancer. The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. [...] This may not come as a surprise since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. [...] Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. [...] This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes.|$|E
500|$|Blackout {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. On music review aggregator Metacritic the album holds {{a score of}} sixty-one out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on 24 critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of AllMusic, described the album as [...] "state-of-the-art dance-pop, a testament to skills of the producers and perhaps even Britney being somehow cognizant enough to realize she should hire the best, even if she's not at her best." [...] Dennis Lim of Blender deemed it as [...] "her most consistent , a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright, brash electropop." [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly commented that while the album is not poetry, [...] "there is something delightfully escapist about Blackout, a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant {{in the kind of}} bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits." [...] A reviewer for NME said that the heavily treated vocals make Spears sound robotic, adding that [...] "it could really do with a few more human touches." [...] Pitchfork's Tom Ewing called [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] the centerpiece of the album, and added that [...] "like most of Blackout, is superb modern pop, which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment. Britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car-crash copy and her record can fit into that if you want it to." [...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated. And Britney's off-disc life is both distraction from and <b>enabler</b> for this extraordinary album". Mike Schiller of PopMatters said that [...] "Right down to its utterly garish cover, Blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable." [...] Melissa Maerz from Rolling Stone explained that Blackout [...] "is {{the first time in her}} career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life" [...] and that [...] "she's gonna crank the best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits." [...] Rob Sheffield of the same magazine described Blackout as [...] "one of the most influential albums in modern pop".|$|E
