40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of die forging {{which is a}} production method that is mainly used in large-scale production. Design of forgings is based on drawing documentation. It evaluates {{the usefulness of the}} component, then the required additions are specified and the machine is selected. At present hammers presses and horizontal <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> are used. Hammers work with hit energy. The movement of the tool ends with an anvil. The component is mostly made for several strokes. Hammers are appropriate for the production of shaped and height-versatile and rugged forgings with ribs and protrusions. Press is a machine that works with pressure. The speed of the ram is relatively small, the effect on the material is quiet and without impact. The biggest application is for die forgings which needs a great force to form. They are used primarily for the production of low and less rigid components. Horizontal <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> are essentially double-acting presses designed for making forgings of various shapes made of rod material...|$|R

Next, the results of the modeling of the rotary compression process for a hollow stepped shafts by the finite element method are given. The process for manufacturing hollow shafts was modeled using the Simufact. Forming simulation program. The FEM results are then verified experimentally in the designed <b>forging</b> <b>machine</b> for rotary compression. The experimental results confirm that axisymmetric hollow shafts can be produced by the rotary compression method.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{investment}} needed in countries such as e. g. Europe and Asia, there is an increasing demand for machines for the manufacture of rails, railway wheels and railway axles. At the moment railway axles are in most cases forged in a series of different forming processes. In an initial rolling process for example possible defects in the starting material are closed {{in order to get a}} homogenous microstructure. In a subsequent forging process, due to the low depth penetration capacity of the plants used, only the contouring of the axle is carried out. The SMS Meer presentation shows that using the SMX hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine</b> from SMS Meer it is possible to produce railway axles in a single forming process. This means that pore-free railway axles with an excellent microstructure can be produced from conventional continuous cast material without any upstream rolling process being required. Using the hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine,</b> continuous cast carbon steel with defects running in an axial direction can be forged into a railway twin axle in only one heat. The high forming potential of the hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine</b> makes this possible. The analyses with regard to microstructure, grain size and pore detection will show very good results. In the zone with the least degree of forming, a homogeneous microstructure evenly distributed across the radius was achieved. The average grain size of 8. 5 (ASTM) is likewise evenly distributed across the radius. An ultrasonic analysis of the forged axles showed that there are no pores larger than 3 mm. As these results are very promising, the forging time will be optimized in subsequent tests and the forged axles will be finish machined for a final analysis in accordance with the railway standard...|$|R

In this case, the results would be practical and reliable for further theoretical analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial forging method in open-die hydraulic forging presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die forging device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the kinetics of precipitation of MX-type (M - metal, X - metalloid) interstitial phases in austenite of constructional steels microalloyed with Nb, Ti, V and B, assigned for production of <b>forged</b> <b>machine</b> elements {{with the use of}} thermo-mechanical treatment. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was conducted basing on the dependence of solubility of MX-type phases in austenite as a function of temperature. The research of influence of austenitizing temperature in a temperature range from 900 to 1200 °C on grain size of primary austenite has been used to verify the analysis. Findings: The kinetics of TiN, TiC and NbC precipitation as well as the temperature sequence of precipitation of these phases have been determined. The investigation of influence of austenitizing temperature on the grain size of primary austenite confirmed correctness of the analysis. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was done basing on the thermodynamic model proposed by Adrian, assuming that only individual, single MX phases are soluble in austenite. Practical implications: The studies provide the basis for proper design of manufacturing process of thermo-mechanical treatment of high strength <b>forged</b> <b>machine</b> parts obtained from microalloyed steels. Originality/value: The kinetics of precipitation of interstitial phases in newly elaborated microalloyed steels has been compiled...|$|R
