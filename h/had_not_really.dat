5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> planned on selling her. He {{felt he had to}} because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E

25|$|Without naval support, Hamilcar Barca was cut {{off from}} Carthage and forced to {{negotiate}} peace and agree to evacuate Sicily.

25|$|Gold {{resigned}} from the Communist Party on August 24, 1950, and signed the Taft-Hartley oath. However, {{he made it clear}} that he had resigned only so the Fur Workers could receive the protection of federal law. The Justice Department argued that Gold <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 it was {{discovered}} that samples of suspected Lassa fever showed evidence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone as early as 2006.

It is suspected that fruit bats are natural carriers of disease, native to this region of Africa including Sierra Leone and also a popular food source for both humans and wildlife.

25|$|In 1915, {{during the}} First World War, South African forces invaded and the {{following}} year an Anglican priest, Nelson Fogarty, established the first Anglican presence, initially to minister to the South African troops and civilians who had followed the military occupation. After the war South Africa administered the territory under a League of Nations mandate and Nelson Fogarty {{began to think of}} ways of making the Anglican presence more permanent by evangelising the local people. It was established that the Finnish mission in Ovamboland <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> established churches among the Kwanyama people who lived in northern Ovamboland and southern Angola.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 W.T. Odhner got {{the rights}} to {{manufacture}} his calculator back from Königsberger & C, which had held them since it was first patented in 1878, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> produced anything. Odhner used his Saint Petersburg workshop to manufacture his calculator and he built and sold 500 machines in 1890. This manufacturing operation shut down definitively in 1918 with 23,000 machines produced. The Odhner Arithmometer was a redesigned version of the Arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar with a pinwheel engine, which made it cheaper to manufacture {{and gave it a}} smaller footprint while keeping the advantage of having the same user interface.|$|E
25|$|Haig gave Foch {{the same}} advice at the Senlis Conference (25 October) – he was privately {{suspicious}} of French plans {{to occupy the}} Rhineland, writing to his wife (1 November) that {{the peace of the}} world for the next fifty years depended on not driving Germany to seek future revenge by humiliating her. He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision to save lives and money by offering Germany an armistice once she was clearly beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> been defeated. The Allies agreed to offer peace {{on the basis of the}} Fourteen Points with a British opt-out for Point 2 (Freedom of the Seas).|$|E

Smalley (born October 1846 in Ohio; died September 2, 1889 in Ohio) and Jonathan Franklin Tracy (born about 1845 in Otway, Ohio), a Wisconsin physician. on December 18, 1910 in Florence, Nebraska. Prudence had previously been engaged, but broke off her engagement to the other man who had decided to migrate to Canada. Wedge and Prudence were soon engaged, and had announced their wedding date, but Prudence cancelled the wedding after a family friend brought to her mother's attention rumors that Wedge <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> reformed but was rather living an immoral life. In 1909 Wedge resigned from the pastorate and relocated to San Francisco to work as a missionary on the Barbary Coast. After their marriage, the Wedges moved to San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|In 1785, while Priestley {{was engaged}} in a {{pamphlet}} war over Corruptions, he also published The Importance and Extent of Free Enquiry, claiming that the Reformation <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> reformed the church.

500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, because I thought it was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treatments}} of democratic capitalism by religious writers, in papal encyclicals and mainline Protestant theology, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> understood its essence.

500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> shopped it much, because sometimes {{you do not want to}} come out of the bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|South Vietnamese {{forces had}} {{performed}} well during the incursion but their leadership was uneven. General Tri proved a resourceful and inspiring commander, earning the sobriquet the [...] "Patton of the Parrot's Beak" [...] from the American media. General Abrams also praised {{the skill of}} General Nguyen Viet Thanh, commander of IV Corps and planner of the Parrot's Beak operation. Unfortunately for the anti-communists, both officers were killed in helicopter crashes—Thanh on 2 May in Cambodia and Tri in February 1971. Other ARVN commanders, however, had not performed well. Even {{at this late date}} in the conflict, the appointment of ARVN general officers was prompted by political loyalty rather than professional competence. As a test of Vietnamization, the incursion was praised by American generals and politicians alike, but the Vietnamese <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> performed alone. The participation of U.S. ground and air forces had precluded any such claim. When called on to conduct solo offensive operations during the incursion into Laos (Operation Lam Son 719) in 1971, the ARVN's continued weaknesses would become all too apparent.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> liked any of Elaine Stritch's appearances as Jack's mother on the series, writing that [...] "Jack's fear and loathing of his mother just feels claustrophobic and uncomfortable instead of funny, and I'm as eager to {{see the end of}} her visits as [...] usually is." [...] Sepinwall said that [...] "very little" [...] of [...] "Christmas Special" [...] worked. [...] "I {{want to be in the}} holiday spirit, but this is two Christmas duds in a row from 30 Rock, and we can't even blame the looming writers strike this time around." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning believed the show could have delivered a Christmas episode, but noted that their attempt at it [...] "was a little less than satisfying. The ideas were there, but the rhythm of the episode was off." [...] Nonetheless, Canning said the episode was not terrible. He enjoyed all the plots except for Liz's, writing that it did not quite fit, and that [...] "the overall result of Liz's plot just wasn't all that funny." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina for Paste found that there was nothing [...] "special" [...] about this episode. In his opinion, Liz should be featured in [...] "new and exciting plot line" [...] rather than helping Jack endure his troubles with his mother.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1949, {{earlier than}} U.S. {{intelligence}} analysts had anticipated, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic device. This event and the almost concurrent retreat of the Kuomintang regime from mainland China hastened {{debate within the}} administration {{as to whether the}} United States should develop a hydrogen bomb. Initially, Johnson suspected [...] despite confirming air samples [...] that the Soviets <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> tested an atomic device at all. He theorized that perhaps an accidental laboratory explosion had occurred, and that no reassessments of U.S. defense capabilities were needed.|$|E
2500|$|Is Socialism Doomed? The Meaning of Mitterrand was {{published}} by Oxford University Press in 1988. The book dissects the phenomenon of François Mitterrand, who came into office as the first socialist president in French history with [...] "the most radical program of any offered in the West by a prospective government in at least thirty years", {{but by the end}} of the 1980s had abandoned radicalism and turned the French Socialist Party back into a standard European social democratic party. Singer argued that the disappointment of Mitterrand for socialists demonstrated not that socialism is a futile project, but that Mitterrand <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> attempted it.|$|E
2500|$|Silverman played Geraldine {{alongside}} Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This Waltz, {{written and}} directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted [...] "real bodies and real women." [...] In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.|$|E
