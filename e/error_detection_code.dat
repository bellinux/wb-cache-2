This paper presents two novel techniques for minimizing the mis-correction of a post-Viterbi processor based on an <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> <b>code.</b> One is a method for achieving a low probability of mis-selection in actual error-type. The other is a method for achieving a low probability of mis-positioning in error-location of an occurred error event.

40|$|We {{present a}} new channel coding system which {{combines}} error detection and error correction using a single high-memory convolutional code, i. e., no dedicated <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> <b>code</b> is required. Since the state complexity of high-memory convolutional codes makes maximum-likelihood decoding impractical, a modified sequential decoder –the Far End Error Decoder (FEED) – is proposed. FEED {{adds to the}} conventional sequential decoding procedure a post processing operation which allows to compute the path reliability of the decoded path. With this path reliability the first error in the decoded frame can be localized, thus, enabling combined error correction and detection with a single code. The advantage of the proposed scheme over applying a dedicated <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> <b>code</b> is demonstrated at {{the example of the}} GSM Fullrate Speech Codec. Although the Fullrate Speech Codec is by far not the most suited source coding scheme for our new approach, a gain of up to ¢ dB in SegSNR or £ dB in channel SNR can be achieved with a peak complexity equal to the standard GSM system.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> <b>codes,</b> {{quadratic}} dual residue codes, to protect cryptographic computations running on general-purpose processor cores against fault attacks. The assumed adversary model is a powerful one, whereby the attacker can inject errors anywhere in the data path of a general-purpose microprocessor by bit flipping. We demonstrate that quadratic dual residue codes provide a much better protection under this powerful adversary model compared to similar codes previously proposed for the same purpose in the literature. The adopted strategy aims to protect the single-precision arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, which usually dominate the execution time of many public key cryptography algorithms in general-purpose microprocessors. Two so called robust units for addition and multiplication operations, which provide a protection against faults attacks, are designed and tightly integrated into the data path of a simple, embedded re-configurable processor. We report the implementation results that compare the proposed <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> <b>codes</b> favorably with previous proposals of similar type in the literature.

Yet, all these advantages have limited improvement unless the required safety level is met. In fact, for such systems, a very high safety level is imposed by both the safety-critical property {{of the system and}} certification standards (e. g., ARP 4754 A and ARP 4761 standard). Now, industrials such as Airbus Helicopters aim at installing fully digital FBW architectures on future helicopters. This step raises new challenges particularly to comply with certification standards requirements. We present, in this paper, the architecture of future fully digital Airbus Helicopters FCS considered at the end of feasibility study. We focus particularly on the communication integrity issue of future digital architectures. In such systems, the non-detection of corrupted messages could lead to catastrophic consequences. To enhance communication integrity, we propose an end-to-end communication integrity approach based on the black channel concept, it is to be implemented in the application layer.
