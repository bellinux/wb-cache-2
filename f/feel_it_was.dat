5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

Three years later, the Penn Board of Trustees endowed a professorship and several fellowships in Gregorian’s name and awarded him an honorary degree in recognition of his roles as the university’s founding Dean of Arts and Sciences and Provost.|$|E
25|$|However, {{though the}} team {{occasionally}} clicked, {{such as in}} a 6–2 win over Manchester United and a 5–0 win over Sunderland, none of the trio had the desired impact. Gallacher was Chelsea's top scorer {{in each of his}} four seasons, scoring 81 goals in total, but his time in west London was hindered by his personal troubles and punctuated by long suspensions for indiscipline, including a two-month ban for swearing at a referee. Jackson and Cheyne struggled to settle at the club and were unable re-capture their previous achievements. The trio did not make 300 appearances between them and by 1936 all had left at a significant financial loss to the club. Their disappointment epitomised Chelsea's flaws throughout the decade, whereby performances and results rarely matched the calibre of players at the club. Money was spent, but some <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too often spent on inappropriate players, especially forwards, while the defence remained neglected.|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Martin Malek, western countries did not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to aggravate relations with Russia over [...] "tiny and insignificant" [...] Georgia. He {{wrote in the}} Caucasian Review of International Affairs that western policy makers {{did not want to}} isolate Russia because its support was necessary to solve [...] "international problems". The May 2015 report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament 2015 stated that [...] "the reaction of the EU to Russia’s aggression towards, and violation of the territorial integrity of, Georgia in 2008 may have encouraged Russia to act in a similar way in Ukraine".|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, a famous {{painting}} by Italian Early Renaissance artist Masaccio appears in the background. Because the painting contains nudity, Fox's network executives took issue with the scene, forcing the show to edit out the genitalia on the painting. Paul Rabwin later noted that [...] "the network executive censors didn't <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> appropriate for us to show all the details [...] course, they could see people giving birth to hundreds of snakes, but that's OK." [...] On the seventh season DVD special features, the painting is erroneously attributed to the famed Michelangelo.|$|E

Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an {{interview}} so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline [...] "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman". I felt {{like a piece of}} meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{his music}} has {{remained}} popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted {{the music for}} its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as [...] "lacking in elevated thought," [...] according to longtime New York Times music critic Harold C. Schonberg, and derided its formal workings as deficient {{because they did not}} stringently follow Western principles.|$|E

[...] {{features}} a dramatic {{scene in which}} Jim presents a DVD {{of the highlights of}} his relationship with Pam, topped with him finally presenting her with a card he wrote in the second season episode [...] "Christmas Party". The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during [...] "A.A.R.M." [...] did the writers <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the right time. In addition, the episode contained several scenes that were purposely staged to be reminiscent of past episodes of the series, with scenes mimicking unique shots in both the third season installment [...] "Gay Witch Hunt" [...] and the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of his life, Loving took an {{interest}} in politics, supporting both Republican and Democratic candidates. During the United States presidential election, 1916, Loving requested his former patron, Taft, introduce him to Republican presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes, with whose campaign he sought to volunteer. Taft, however, declined in a letter, explaining he did not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> appropriate for him to offer such an introduction to a political candidate (in that letter, Taft also expressed to Loving his regret that [...] "you are no longer {{at the head of the}} Constabulary Band which was largely your creation.")

500|$|As {{early as}} November 1972, James Whitmore {{expressed}} a desire to leave Temperatures Rising, claiming that [...] "the show [...] basically a broad farce and I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right for me". Screen Gems head John Mitchell and ABC chief programmer Barry Diller decided to replace Whitmore with comedian Paul Lynde, whose sitcom, The Paul Lynde Show, was airing on Wednesday nights. At the time, Lynde was scoring second only to Peter Falk in TV popularity polls even though his sitcom, which aired opposite The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour on CBS, was floundering in the ratings. Asher was against making this change but was overruled as his contractual commitments to ABC had been used up.|$|E
500|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the season}} 6 premiere, NYPD Blue {{executives}} assured the public that Smits' storyline would not be irreversible. However, this led to doubt among critics who did not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to have a sensible storyline that retained the services of Kim Delaney in the role of Simone's wife Detective Diane Russell. A humorous piece in Newsweek described the general consensus as [...] "He's gonna die. He looks like he's dying...If he dies, it's easy to keep his wife (played by Kim Delaney) on the show." [...] In addition, his castmates noted that their characters would grieve. However, some sources, such as National Public Radio's Noah Adams and Robert Siegel, read into the fact that [...] "Network publicity speaks of Simone's departure, not his demise..." ...|$|E

Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing.

In seven years, I have been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I just <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good dedication for him."

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rahman, [...] "Jai Ho" [...] {{was meant}} to create [...] "a vision {{of the whole world}} celebrating this victory". The song {{contains}} a mix of [...] "multiple motifs from the traditional pieces on the soundtrack" [...] with [...] "the big drums and blasting horns of the present". It was originally composed and shortlisted for Subhash Ghai's 2008 film Yuvvraaj. Although Rahman was excited about the song, Ghai [...] "wasn't too kicked about it". Ghai felt it was [...] "too subtle and soft to be picturized on the character played by Zayed Khan". Rahman and Gulzar believed the song had [...] "immense potential" [...] and used it in Slumdog Millionaire. Following the song's win at the Oscar's, Rahman stated that: [...] "He [...] said the words had a positive <b>feel.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> like a prayer. I honestly didn't think the song would win me an Oscar though. But like the film Slumdog suggests, everything has its own destiny".|$|E
500|$|An early draft had Hess {{surrounded}} by others sitting squarely around him. Hess felt the depiction {{had a more}} natural look, Rockwell objected, [...] "It was too diverse, it went every which way and didn't settle anywhere or say anything." [...] He felt the upward view from the bench level was more dramatic. Rockwell explained to Yates at The Post {{that he had to}} start Freedom of Speech from scratch after an early attempt because he had overworked it. Twice he almost completed the work only to <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lacking. Eventually, he was able to produce the final version with the speaker as the subject rather than the assembly. For the accompanying essay, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose novelist and dramatist Tarkington who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. People who purchased war bonds during the Second War Bond Drive received a full-color set of reproductions of the Four Freedoms that had a commemorative cover with Freedom of Speech on it.|$|E
