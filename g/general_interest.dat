5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} {{editorial}} director in 2008, and {{was followed by}} Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond <b>general</b> <b>interest,</b> the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF's average {{attendance}} at Malmö Stadion initially lay steady at around 15,000 per season from the mid-1960s {{to the early}} 1970s, before decreasing to around 10,000 spectators per season {{for the remainder of}} that decades. During the 1980s and the 1990s, attendances decreased even further down to an average of around 5,000 fans per season; the <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> in Swedish football was also very low at the time. Attendance took a sharp turn upwards during the 2001 season, Malmö FF's first season back in Allsvenskan after a season in Superettan. Average crowds then increased annually, and reached their peak during the 2004 season, when Malmö FF reached an all-time record average attendance of 20,061. Attendances afterwards decreased each year, and were down to a seasonal average of 11,182 by the time of Malmö FF's final season at the ground.

5|$|The {{additional}} turbo-propulseur {{patent application}} 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With {{the help of}} Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised {{the building of a}} motor sled, powered by a 30hp (22kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă's turbo-propulseur design was shown {{for the second time in}} late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.|$|E
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide <b>general</b> <b>interest</b> became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of <b>general</b> <b>interest.</b> Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
