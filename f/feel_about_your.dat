2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time. The closest you could come is to say, 'How do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> children?'" [...] Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has [...] "decimated her creative work" [...] over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. [...] "It's been difficult because there has been a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... This has been an important part of my life for the last nine years or so," [...] he said.|$|E

If you marry anybody, marry Cicely Drane. I have been thinking ever and ever so much about her and about you, and I {{made up my mind}} to speak to you of this as soon as I got home, so that you might have a chance to think about it before you should see Dora. Don't you remember what you used to tell me about the time when you were obliged to travel so much, and how, when you had a seat to yourself in a car, and a crowd of people were coming in, you used {{to make room for the}} first nice person you saw, because you knew you would have to have somebody sitting alongside of you, and you liked to choose for yourself? Now that is the way I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> getting married; if you marry Cicely Drane, I shall feel safe for the rest of my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|A study {{conducted}} by London et al. (1977) was about job and leisure satisfaction contributing to quality of life (QOL). QOL was determined by asking the participants [...] "How do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life as a whole" [...] twice during {{the run of the}} study. As well, {{the participants were asked to}} fill out a survey that measured feelings about leisure, work, and life. It was found that activities that had to do with families and people they socialize with was significant to QOL. Overall non-job related activities (leisure activities) can be more important and a better predictor of QOL as opposed to variables of job related activities. People should consider the importance of the amount of time spent in leisure activities.|$|E

It was awkward for me to watch it. For one, it's about yourself, so there's no common experience. There's no one I can ask, [...] "Gee, how did you feel?" [...] I can't call Figaro or Carmen and say, [...] "Hey, how did you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> opera?" [...] It's just a very {{personal}} moment that I can't express to anybody.

That’s where contents analysis using data mining software comes in. It monitors and evaluates your online mentions to show you how the whole Web is reacting to your news in real time.

5000|$|Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind {{gave the}} series a perfect star rating of 5 out of 5, writing [...] "I've watched this episode three times, {{and each time}} I'm as buzzed as I was before.

She'll end up playing an {{integral}} role, I'm sure of it; she's got powerful enough magics to heal Amara, and that might come in handy later on. This season of Supernatural {{has been such a}} revival from the up-and-downs of the past. I can't wait to see how it all comes to an end." [...] Caitlin Kelly of Hypable wrote, [...] "Perhaps what feels so off about this episode for me, however, is how little it is about the Winchesters. This episode felt like it could have happened even if the brothers weren't present, and that's not how you should <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> main characters.
