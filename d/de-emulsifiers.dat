40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} weight of polyester based <b>de-emulsifiers</b> on the de-elmulsification of Nigerian crude {{has been carried}} out. It was observed that initially, as the molecular weight of the polyesters (<b>de-emulsifiers)</b> increased, there was a corresponding fourth order polynomial increase in its performance when {{they were used to}} screen the Nigerian Crude Oil Emulsion (NCOE). It was further observed that beyond a molecular weight value of 7500 g/mol it tended towards an asymptote at 30. 6 % performance. Beyond this point, further increase in the molecular weight of the de-emulsifier did not produce any significant increase in performance on the de-emulsification process of the NCOE. The performance of the <b>de-emulsifiers</b> also increases as the time of de-emulsification increases. For all the de-emulsifier samples, performance was highest after 10 minutes...|$|E
40|$|The de-emulsification of water-in-oil {{emulsion}} of Ogharefe crude oil sample was studied by using formulated polyester based de-emulsifier sample A and a commercially available de-emulsifier sample C. The bottle test method {{was used to}} screen the de-emulsifier samples using the crude oil emulsion. The performance of the <b>de-emulsifiers</b> was {{expressed in terms of}} percentage of water separated from 100 ml samples of emulsions. For both the formulated and commercial deemulsifiers, the performance increased with increased concentration of the <b>de-emulsifiers,</b> separation time and operating temperature. The effect of the operating temperature was much higher and there was a linear relationship (R 2 ranging from 0. 96 to 0. 99) between performance and temperature. The performance of the best of the formulated <b>de-emulsifiers,</b> sample A, was better than that of the commercial de-emulsifier under all the conditions of this study- the volume of water expelled by sample A was 5 times that of the commercial one at 30 oC. At 70 oC, this ratio increased to 14...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and development of <b>de-emulsifiers</b> for separating water from crude oil emulsions usually result in varying degrees of success, depending on the location and the type of crude being treated. This makes <b>de-emulsifiers</b> crude oil specific and thus gives rise to the continuous search for more and effective <b>de-emulsifiers</b> that can meet the specific needs of each locality. In this study, base-catalyzed phenol formaldehyde resins were formulated at varying formaldehyde to phenol ratios (1. 2 : 1 – 1. 8 : 1); the assessment was carried out by the bottle test method at varied de-emulsifier concentrations (vol/vol) in xylene acting as solvent diluent. The bottle test was carried out at an optimum temperature of 70  °C, dosage of 50  ppm and residence times of 10 and 20  min. A factorial design was done to determine the best combination of the de-emulsification conditions for the resolution of the Nigerian crude oil emulsion. The results were analyzed and optimized using Minitab 16 utilizing a Pareto chart, normal effects, main effects and interaction plots. From the analysis carried out, {{it was found that the}} most effective formulated de-emulsifier was obtained at formaldehyde to phenol (F:P) mole ratio of 1. 8 : 1, 80 % de-emulsifier concentration in xylene and residence time of 20  min. This de-emulsifier obtained a water separation efficiency of 79 % compared to the commercial de-emulsifier which gave 71 % efficiency. Thus the solution of P:F <b>de-emulsifiers</b> in xylene enhances the de-emulsification of the Nigerian crude oil emulsions...|$|E

This {{study concluded that}} surfactant-added steam flooding could not be simulated with the available simulator as it had no option to examine combines effects; however, the simulation of core-flooding runs for water, surfactant solution, and steam flooding were successful and confirmed the validity, accuracy, and applicability of laboratory results.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of antibiotics typically consists of fermentation, removal of biomass, solvent extraction, and crystallization. Vacuum rotary filtration or other conventional filtration systems and microfiltration {{are used to}} remove the biomass, but the biomass removal step fails to remove macromolecules including polysaccharides and proteins which may act as emulsifiers causing emulsion in the subsequent solvent extraction process, and reducing the process efficiency and product quality. In this work, {{an attempt was made}} to remove these "emulsifiers" before solvent extraction using ultrafiltration (UF). Bench and pilot scale spiral wound membrane modules with the MWCO of 5, 20 and 50 kDa were tested to treat benzylpenicillin (Pen G) broth following microbe removal. The UF permeates were subsequently fed to solvent extraction (acidic extraction at pH 2. 0). The experimental results showed that UF could significantly improve the extraction operation in terms of phase separation, elimination of the need for any <b>de-emulsifier</b> or wet agent, and increase extraction recovery and product quality. Similar improvements from UF were observed in the extractions of erythromycin and medmycin (alkaline extraction at pH 10. 0 and 8. 7, respectively). The experimental results show that UF is an alternative to the use of <b>de-emulsifier</b> or other wet agent to obtain good phase separation even by gravity without centrifugal extractor in solvent extractions of Pen G, erythromycin and medmycin. The mechanisms of the improvement of extraction were discussed based on the experimental results on characterizing the feed and permeate solutions of UF. And it was concluded that there existed bioemulsifiers in antibiotic fermentation broth and UF could successfully remove them and hence could improve the extraction operation.

40|$|The de-emulsification of a Nigerian {{crude oil}} {{emulsion}} {{has been investigated}} using locally formulated base and acid catalyzed phenol formaldehyde resins with varied formaldehyde to phenol molar ratios. The bottle test method {{was used for the}} screening process and the best de-emulsifier was chosen based on the largest volume of water removed from the crude oil emulsion. The screening process was done at temperatures of 50 and 70 °C and de-emulsifier concentrations of 20 and 50 part per million (ppm), respectively. A factorial design was done to determine the best combination of de-emulsification conditions for optimal performance. The results were optimized and analyzed using software called Minitab 16 utilizing pareto chart, normal effects, main effects and interactions plots. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} optimum set of conditions for best performance of the resole de-emulsifier were 50 ppm, 70 °C and 1. 8 : 1 concentration, screening temperature and formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio, respectively. While for novolak <b>de-emulsifiers,</b> they were 50 ppm, 70 °C and 0. 1 : 1.

40|$|Measurements of {{thermodynamic}} {{interfacial tension}} sigma at a non-equilibrium surfactant adsorption {{have been made}} using a pulsed drop rheometer. The pulsed drop rheometer {{is based on an}} instantaneous expansion of a water droplet in oil. After perturbation an interfacial relaxation occurs, the interfacial pressure decay is followed as a function of time using a sensitive pressure transducer. The difference in pressure across a curved interface and the interfacial tension are directly related. Interfacial tension decays can be obtained above and below the surfactants CMC. The interfacial tension decays obtained were fitted to known relaxation mechanisms, and found generally to fit diffusional mechanisms. The funnel technique involves expansion of the interface through a funnel, the interfacial tension decays are followed directly. The results were found to be analogous to measurements made by the pulsed drop. Measurements have been made of the interfacial shear viscosity of a polymeric surfactant at the oil / water interface, the interface showed Newtonian-like behaviour. Small nearly monodisperse oil-in-water emulsions were prepared. The parameters involved in their successful preparation have been investigated, the emulsion was characterized by bulk rheology. The instability to salt addition of some systems and small droplet size allowed perikinetic measurements of the coalescing emulsion by photon correlation spectroscopy. Model water-in-oil emulsions were prepared, similar in composition to the interfacial rheology work. These emulsions were investigated in the presence of <b>de-emulsifiers</b> by perikinetic and bulk emulsion stability studies. Mobility vs. potassium chloride concentration data in the thin double layer region has been determined for some model emulsion systems and polystyrene latices. The applicability to the thin double layer electrokinetic theory has been determined for all these systems...|$|E
