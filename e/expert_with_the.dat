5|$|Wave Race 64 is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} players race on Jet Skis in {{different}} weather conditions and {{on a variety of}} courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert and Reverse, the latter being <b>Expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tracks oriented backwards. Hard, Expert, and Reverse must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{personal}} characteristics that influenced his fiction were his expertise in martial arts and his addiction to tobacco. Zelazny became <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> épée in college, and thus began a lifelong study of several different martial arts, including karate, judo, aikido (which he later taught as well, having gained a black belt), t'ai chi, taekwondo, hapkido, Hsing I, and pa kua. In turn, {{many of his}} characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills whilst dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe smoker (until he quit in the early '80s), so much so, that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit {{in order to improve}} his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking too.|$|E

Scarlett is additionally skilled in martial arts and acrobatics. She started training at age 9 with her father and three brothers, who were all instructors, and she earned her first black belt at age 15. Scarlett also graduated summa cum laude, and passed her Bar Exams to practice law, before moving into the military. She graduated from Advanced Infantry Training and Ranger School, and received special education in Covert Ops School, Marine Sniper School, Special Air Service School, and Marine Tae Kwon Do Symposium. Although she is as adept with standard weapons as any of her comrades, her weapon of choice is the XK-1 power crossbow, which fires various bolts with specialized functions. Scarlett is also a qualified <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> M-14, M-16, M1911A1 Auto Pistol, M79 grenade launcher, M-3A1, M-700 Remington sniper rifle, MAC-10, throwing stars, garotte and KA-BAR (Combat Knife).|$|E

500|$|Comstock {{threatened}} Ortiz {{with legal}} action, and the manager– unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful {{that he could}} cause trouble for the gallery– was initially frightened. He consulted with Arthur Brisbane of the New York Evening Journal, who {{told him he had}} nothing to fear, and sent some reporters to cover the story. The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as [...] "one art <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship". Following Comstock's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling September Morn. The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of September Morn, so that it could remain in his window.|$|E

Referring to the discrepancies between what constitutes reliable data when determining whether or not to increase the margin of safety tenfold, Richard Weiss (a pesticide <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Environmental Working Group) said, [...] "The EPA has failed to comply with the clear intent and requirements of the law". While environmentalists complained, so did farmers.

2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the NTSB and Parker Hannifin had already ruled out the {{possibility}} of mechanical failure as a cause to the crash of Flight 185 due to a defective PCU servo valve-unit (manufactured by Parker Hannifin), an independent and private investigation refocused on and further examined the recovered PCU device whose malfunctioning has been pointed out in other sudden Boeing 737 crashes. The manufacturer's records relating to this particular unit revealed that it had failed some routine tests, but they claimed to have corrected these problems. A metals <b>expert,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of images from a scanning electron microscope, concluded that the servo valve had 'chip-outs' and numerous burrs [...] "that could easily have interfered with the smooth operation of the valve." [...] After this investigation was complete, in 2004, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury in the United States, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB's conclusions about the accident, found that the crash was caused by a defective servo valve in the plane's rudder. The hydraulic PCU device manufacturer, Parker Hannifin, was ordered to pay the three families of victims involved in that case US$43.6 million. After threatening to appeal the verdict, Parker Hannifin later compensated all families involved (although it did not accept liability).|$|E
2500|$|Fafhrd {{commonly}} uses a sword {{which he}} names Graywand, a two-hand sword that he's {{able to use}} one-handed too (in later episodes by necessity). He also carries a poignard named Heartseeker and a short hand-axe which has never been named. For combat at a distance, he often carries a bow and arrow which he wields effectively even while on horseback or at sea, and which he's able to use despite his final handicap (he loses a hand). The Mouser, in one episode called [...] "the best swordsman in the World", also fights {{with a pair of}} weapons: a [...] "slim, curving" [...] sword or sabre called Scalpel, and a dagger called Cat's Claw, the latter usually hidden in the small of the Mouser's back, and the original of which had a very subtle curve. (It was a straight-bladed weapon by the events of Lean Times in Lankhmar.) [...] As the pair are often divested of their property, these are names they apply to any of their appropriate weapons and not necessarily names of specific ones. They are absolutely not magic weapons: both the wielders are just very able to use them. The Mouser is also an <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sling.

2500|$|The {{relevance}} of this evidence was challenged in 1987 when Charlie Whipple, a former Globe editorial page editor, stated that {{while working as}} a reporter back in 1937, he had a conversation with Boston Police Sergeant Edward J. Seibolt. [...] According to Whipple, Seibolt told him that he was part of a [...] "father-and-son ballistics team" [...] who had worked on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, and that [...] "we switched the murder weapon in that case." [...] When Whipple asked why, Seibolt replied [...] "we suspected the other side of switching weapons, so we just switched them back." [...] When Whipple asked if he could print Seibolt's statement, Seibolt replied [...] "If you do, I'll call you a liar." [...] Whipple's story remained unsubstantiated, as Seibolt died in 1961 and never corroborated the story. [...] Moreover, police records indicate that Seibolt was only a Patrolman {{at the time of the}} Sacco and Vanzetti trial, and did not earn a promotion to Sergeant and a position as a ballistics <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Boston Police Department until October 1935. [...] A full transcript of the hearings, on microfilm at Harvard Law School, shows that Judge Webster Thayer made no determination as to who had switched the barrels, but merely ordered the rusty barrel restored to Sacco's pistol.|$|E
