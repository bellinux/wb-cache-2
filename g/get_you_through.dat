Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>through</b> life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E

[...] He praised the concept of mixing two gameplay styles; [...] "it would be easy to get stuck in a rut as a gaming experience if you were constantly engaged in a blistering hack-and-slash the whole time. Likewise, a pure stealth experience would soon feel restrictive and frustrating." [...] However, he felt the stealth sections were underdeveloped, arguing [...] "they're just never that enjoyable on a basic level," [...] and calling them [...] "tedious, exacting, basic and inconsistent." [...] However, he was also critical of the action sections, calling them [...] "blister inducing," [...] and arguing [...] "the same tactics <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>through</b> every time."

[...] "A man may disapprove in toto of the present system of competitive examinations for the army," [...] he said slowly; [...] "for my part, I certainly do, and I make no secret of it; admitting a lot of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers plump into the highest ranks of the service: no tone, no character, no position, no gentlemanly feeling; a great mistake--a great mistake; I told them so at the time. I said to them, 'Gentlemen, you are simply ruining the service.' But they took no notice of me; and what's the consequence? Competitive examination has been the ruin of the service, exactly as I told them. Began with that; then abolition of purchase; then local centres; then that abominable strap with the slip buckle--there, there, Harry, upon my soul, my boy, I can't bear to think of it. But a man may be opposed, as I said, to the whole present system of competitive examination, and yet, while that system still unfortunately continues to exist (that is to say, until a European War convinces all sensible people of the confounded folly of it), he may feel that his own young men, who are reading up for a direct commission, ought to be trying their hardest {{to get as much}} of this nonsensical humbug into their heads as possible during the time just before their own examinations. Now, Harry, I'm afraid you're not reading quite as hard as you ought to be doing. The crammer's all very well in his way, of course, but depend upon it, the crammer by himself won't <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>through</b> it. What's needed is private study." ...|$|E
