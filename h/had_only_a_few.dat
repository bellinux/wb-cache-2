5|$|Del Potro {{used the}} Wilson Hyper ProStaff 6.1 Midplus Stretch {{early on in}} his career, and has {{continued}} to use this racquet under new paint jobs years later. Del Potro is very superstitious, and after suffering a wrist injury shortly after switching to the Wilson BLX Pro Tour paint job in 2010, he returned to playing with the then outdated Wilson K-Factor 6.1 95 paint job. He particularly favored the exact racquets he had used to win his only Grand Slam title at the 2009 US Open. He again refused to update his racquet to the Wilson BLX Juice Pro in 2012, and in 2014 <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> K-Factor racquets left. For strings, he uses Luxilon ALU Power strung at 58 lbs.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London {{about how to deal with}} the revolt. The King <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E

25|$|Architectural {{ideas of}} the mid-19th century {{advanced}} by such architects as Pugin, and still adhered to by the recently deceased prominent New Zealand architect Benjamin Mountfort, decreed that only Gothic was suitable for Christian worship.

25|$|Meagher {{spent the}} next four months {{recovering}} from his injuries and took charge of his command three days prior to the Battle of Chancellorsville. After limited engagement at Chancellorsville, Meagher resigned his commission on 14 May 1863. The Army had refused his request to return to New York to raise reinforcements for his battered brigade. The brigade was 4,000strong in mid–May 1862, but by late May 1863, it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred combat-ready men left.|$|E

Every time after a battle, he would set up a market for the distribution of military equipment. Other units would replenish their stocks by taking from him.|$|E

25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts {{as to whether or}} not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft.

25|$|The {{mills and}} the {{community}} were divided along ethnic lines: most of the skilled jobs were held by native-born workers of English, Irish, and German descent, while Québécois, Italian, Slavic, Hungarian, Portuguese and Syrian immigrants made {{up most of the}} unskilled workforce. Several thousand skilled workers belonged, in theory at least, to the American Federation of Labor-affiliated United Textile Workers, but only a few hundred paid dues. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) had also been organizing for five years among workers in Lawrence, but also <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred actual members.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, England and France {{combined}} <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred individuals in asylums. By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization was soon disappointed. Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population. The average number of patients in asylums kept on growing. Asylums were quickly becoming almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions, and the reputation of psychiatry in the medical world had hit an extreme low.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{national}} systems of regulated asylums for the mentally ill had been established in most industrialized countries. At the turn of the century, Britain and France combined <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred people in asylums, but by {{the end of the}} century this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. The United States housed 150,000 patients in mental hospitals by 1904. Germany housed more than 400 public and private sector asylums. These asylums were critical to the evolution of psychiatry as they provided places of practice throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{problems}} with the methanol system earlier in the day, methane clathrate (a flammable ice) had started to accumulate in the gas compression system pipework, causing a blockage. Due to this blockage, condensate (natural gas liquids NGL) Pump B stopped {{and could not be}} restarted. As the entire power supply of the offshore construction work depended on this pump, the manager <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes to bring the pump back online, otherwise the power supply would fail completely. A search was made through the documents to determine whether Condensate Pump A could be started.|$|E

That changed in 1982 when it inherited the membership and tracks of the defunct National Bicycle Association (NBA) which had ceased sanctioning its own races and then went into partnership with the NBL. The NBL acquired all the NBA tracks in the nation including all those west of the Mississippi. As a result, it became a nation-spanning sanctioning body like the ABA.|$|E
