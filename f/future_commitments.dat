50|$|As a result, of the abolishment of the Nautical Branch, it was {{necessary}} {{to find a place to}} house not only those older boys that had been previously on the school ships but also <b>future</b> <b>commitments</b> of boys of that class. Despite the recommendations of the board of trustees and the superintendent, in 1870, the legislature once again changed the minimum age of commitment at the reform school from 14 to 17 allowing for the older class of boys to be committed there. Also that year, the legislature pass provisions allowing the visiting agent to work with the courts to identify suitable boys to indenture directly from the courts without being committed to the reform school first. This would lessen the amount of younger boys committed to the reform school while making additional room for the older incorrigible boys. As a consequence of these two legislative acts there were not enough young qualified boys committed, to fill the trust houses and the quantity of older incorrigible boys increased.|$|E

It is designed to enable the firm to capture more consumer surplus than it otherwise would in a non-discriminating pricing environment. Two-part tariffs may also exist in competitive markets when consumers are uncertain about their ultimate demand.

40|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, several authors have {{computed}} the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the amount specified in the Protocol, while accounting for the possibility to use the flexible mechanisms of the Protocol (internationally tradable emission permits). A number of such studies have recently shown that, following the US withdrawal and the Bonn and Marrakesh agreements, these abatement costs will be very low and the price of the permits could reach zero. However, these analyses usually take only the first commitment period (20082012) into account and do not explicitly consider the possibility of banking permits from one commitment period to the other (Art. 3. 13 of the Protocol). The simple dynamic model that we develop here introduces this possibility. It allows one to analyze the impact of alternative <b>future</b> <b>commitments</b> (post 2012) for the US and the non-Annex B countries on world emissions, abatement costs and the permits price. We find that, provided ambituous post-Kyoto commitments are negotiated: (i) in 2008 - 2012, the amount of banked permits will largely exceed the amount of hot air and permits prices will be much higher than predicted by most other studies, (ii) the banking provision significantly reduces world total costs but increases total costs for all permit-importing Annex B countries (i. e. all Annex B countries except countries of eastern Europe) via a rise in the permits price in 2008 - 2017 and (iii) the issue of market power on hot air {{is not likely to be}} a relevant one.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} suggested that certain groups of futures traders, such as speculators and small traders, exacerbate cash market volatility. Empirical {{research on the}} subject has been conducted in context {{of the relationship between}} price volatility and futures volume or open interest and fails to satisfactorily resolve such an issue. This paper examines the relationship between exchange rate variability and futures trading activity in the context of disaggregated open interest. The data and techniques employed allow for more specific inferences regarding which group of traders contribute to exchange volatility. The results suggest that while 'typical' levels of <b>futures</b> <b>commitments</b> are not destabilizing, surges in the level of commitments of large speculators and small traders causes exchange rate volatility. The actual release of the commitment-of-traders data, however, has no impact on spot prices. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998. ...|$|R
