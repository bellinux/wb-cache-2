25|$|Foster care adoption: {{this is a}} type of {{domestic}} adoption where a child is initially placed in public care. Many times the foster parents take on the adoption when the children become legally free. Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country.

40|$|State <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> {{are forcing}} many foster {{children}} to take high dosages of dangerous, mind-altering psychotropic medications. State actors have little medical background {{for each child}} and have limited time to diagnose disorders, thereby creating potential constitutional and human rights violations. States are only supposed to administer psychotropic medication to a child when necessary and in the child’s best interest. Many children in <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> however, are heavily medicated despite the difficulties of proving necessity. Those difficulties are due {{to a combination of}} diagnosis practice, the foster child’s background, and the poor condition of state <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems.</b> In light of these limitations and the potential for using medication solely to curb bad behavior, such high prescription rates are unjustified. Many states lack in-depth tracking and oversight measures and fail to recognize this problem, thereby allowing abuse to continue and potentially preventing foster children from seeking justice...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> in Australia {{has a long}} and contested history. These histories, along with current media representations of <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> shape {{the ways in which}} the general public understand <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> Importantly, and where such representations are primarily negative, it is likely that <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> will not be considered a viable option for many people seeking to engage in community work or to care for children. This paper provides an analysis of a sample of representations of <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> in the Australian news media, with a specific focus on the depiction of (1) foster children as “lost children” who are “damaged goods”, (2) <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>systems</b> and social workers as inherently damaging to children, (3) foster carers as primarily either inadequate parents, or good parents only in comparison with “bad social workers”.

40|$|Shaped by {{socio-economic}} values {{within our}} society, the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>system???s</b> response to poor transition outcomes of foster youth may place greater importance on concrete skills training, while deemphasizing {{the development and}} navigation of social supports <b>systems</b> outside of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> The <b>system</b> may acclimatize foster youth to pursue services in support systems considered to be unstigmatized by society rather than support systems perceived to be stigmatized.

2500|$|California has {{the largest}} {{population}} of foster care youth in the nation, with 55,218 children in the system as of 2012. This is over {{twice as many as}} the 20,529 foster children in New York, the state with the second largest population of foster youth, had by the end of 2012. Over 30 percent of California foster youth reside in Los Angeles County, amounting to 18,523 children. Children can be removed from their homes and placed into the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> for a variety of reasons, but, in California, 81.2 percent of children were removed because of neglect. Even after being placed in the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>system,</b> however, these children might not find the kind of care or stability they need. Girls in foster care have been shown to have marginally higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the general population of California. Children in foster care also have to face disproportionately high rates of mental illnesses as some studies have shown that as much as 47.9 percent of foster care youth showed signs of serious emotional or behavioral issues. After [...] "aging out" [...] of the system at age 18, research has shown that previous foster youth still face difficult instability in their lives. As much as 30 percent of previous foster children are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Only about 50 percent graduate from high school and less than 10 percent graduate from college. A study focused on foster care alumni in Los Angeles County showed that about 65 percent leave foster care without a place to live and 25 percent are incarcerated by age 20. Despite these difficulties, California is working toward easing the transition for foster youth through programs and legislation like the California Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2010, which expanded upon similar federal legislation and increased the age limit for receiving foster care benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they are}} in the United States without the {{protection}} of their family, URM-designated children are not generally eligible for adoption. This {{is due in part to}} the Hague Convention on the Protection and Co-Operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption, otherwise known as the Hague Convention. [...] Created in 1993, the Hague Convention established international standards for inter-country adoption. In order to protect against the abduction, sale or trafficking of children, these standards protect the rights of the biological parents of all children. Children in the URM program have become separated from their biological parents and the ability to find and gain parental release of URM children is often extremely difficult. Most children, therefore, are not adopted. They are served primarily through the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> of the participating states. Most will be in the custody of the state (typically living with a foster family) until they become adults. Reunification with the child’s family is encouraged whenever possible.|$|E

The intersection of these systems is only one example of many forms of overpolicing that overlap and converge in the lives of poor women of color.

2500|$|The {{state had}} no {{explicit}} regulations {{with respect to}} foster care and parenting by gays and lesbians, either singly or in relationships, until, on May 24, 1985, the state Department of Social Services, {{with the approval of}} Governor Michael Dukakis, created a rule that foster children be placed in [...] "traditional family settings". In December 1986, a commission that reviewed the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> recommended that sexual orientation could not be used to disqualify foster parents. As Dukakis delayed accepting that recommendation, advocates for gay and lesbian rights threatened protests against his presidential campaign. The ban on gay foster parents was enacted into law in the 1989 budget. After a lawsuit challenging the ban was settled out of court, the Dukakis administration withdrew the policy in April 1990. In the 1990s, court decisions further expanded the parenting rights of gays and lesbians. In September 1993, the state's highest court ruled that state law allowed for second-parent adoption by a parent of the same sex as a biological parent. In July 1999, the same court awarded visitation rights to each of two mothers after their separation.|$|E
