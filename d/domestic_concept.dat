Research was performed on private farm in the vicinity of Šabac in Serbia. Obtained results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in losses of body masses and food consumption in sows during lactation period. Nutrition of suckling piglets using mixture which contained adequate premix of domestic production improved the growth rate by 7. 6 %. Cost of food when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of sows and piglets was by 5. 3 % lower, and value of realized piglets by approx. 26. 0 % more favourable when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of sows and suckling piglets. Piglets in rearing were fed mixtures containing imported premixes showed no significantly important effect on gain, but had poorer feed conversion by 6. 2 % compared to animals fed diets containing domestic premix. Domestic premix in mixtures reduced the cost of mixtures by 3. 4 % and reduced the cost of gain of piglets in rearing by 9. 9 % compared to nutrition with diets containing imported premixes.

Sources of the public policy exception: 'International' public policy or 'Domestic' public policy? [...] 4. The concept of public policy: the Indonesian perspective [...] 5. Judicial review of international arbitral awards in Indonesia {{on the grounds of}} public policy [...] 6. Harmonising the concept of the public policy exception in Indonesia with the NYC/model law concepts [...] 7. Conclusion and recommendations. The public policy exception under Article V (2) (b) of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (NYC) is the most controversial ground for challenging {{enforcement of}} foreign arbitral awards. The great uncertainty as to the ambit of the public policy exception has led to inconsistent approach adopted by the courts which created problems for parties wishing to enforce foreign arbitration awards. [...] This thesis explores the complexity and inconsistent application of the public policy exception in Indonesia. It critically analyses the tendency of the Indonesian judiciary system towards the judicial application of public policy in determining the enforceability of foreign arbitral awards after the ratification of the NYC, considering the distinctive feature of the Indonesian legal system and approaches that have been taken by the courts of other countries. Occasionally, reference is also made to statutory provisions in arbitration from other countries to indicate approaches that have been taken elsewhere in regard to the public policy exception. This thesis examines whether current decisions of the Indonesian Supreme Court and the District Courts are in compliance with the pro-enforcement policy of the NYC, which demands a narrow approach to the public policy exception. It also examines the extent of judicial review of foreign arbitral awards by the Indonesian courts, particularly concerning the standards for applying judicial discretion to refuse or allow enforcement under the public policy exception. [...] A proposition presented in this thesis is that the concept of public policy in Indonesia lacks a strong international character and, for this reason, it has a tendency to be interpreted in domestic terms instead of international public policy under the NYC. Another central proposition is that <b>domestic</b> <b>concept</b> of public policy in the Indonesian arbitration law is influenced by Indonesian pluralistic legal traditions and cultures. Therefore, a harmonisation of the concept of public policy in Indonesia with the concept of public policy under the NYC and the Model Law needs to be addressed. [...] Despite the changes brought by new Indonesian arbitration law reform, the central position of the narrow approach to the public policy exception has yet to achieve full recognition. If this situation is related to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Indonesia, {{it can be seen that}} the finality and enforceability of the awards will hardly be achieved until the underlying issue concerning a restrictive concept of public policy is addressed. It is argued that a failure to adopt a narrow approach to the public policy exception can be related to the enforceability of foreign arbitral awards in Indonesia. [...] The recommendations throughout this thesis promote the Indonesian judiciary system to shift away from a 'domestic' concept of public policy. They encourage the Indonesian judiciary and Arbitration legal framework to strongly adopt the concept of internationalism in establishing the judicial approach to public policy exception. In doing so, this thesis also contributes to harmonizing the judicial application of public policy through establishing the concept of 'international' public policy that is based on the narrow approach to the public policy exception and the presumption of favouring enforcement of international arbitral awards.

40|$|Denna uppsats undersöker olika perspektiv av den föreställningsvärld och de myttraditioner som förknippas med Japans kakure kirishitan och kristendomens tidiga historia i Japan. Av speciell vikt är den värld som ligger bortom denna. Detta är inte heller främmande inom inhemsk japansk religiös tradition. Utifrån denna kontext kan vi bättre förstå varför man också i Japan har funnit undervisningen om frälsningen i livet efter detta lätt att ta till sig som målet för tron. Den japanska Mariagestaltens status har stärkts betydligt på bekostnad av Sonen, då hon på många vis har övertagit rollen, fått en gudomlig status och blivit en himmelsk härskarinna. Deusu är inte heller den allsmäktige gudom och fadersgestalt som vi känner genom kristendomen då han är tvungen att vända sig till en ängel för att få råd om hur människosläktet ska räddas. Medeltida katolska traditioner har bevarats i Tenchi Hajimari no Koto, den enda doktrinära text författad av de underjordiska kristna själva. Det heliga dramat har dock i Tenchi Hajimari fått vissa japanska särdrag. Inför korsfästelsen pryglas till exempel Jesus med bambukäppar så hårt att de splittras. De skriftlärda som Jesus talar med i templet är inte längre skriftlärda judar utan buddhistiska lärare. Tenchi Hajimari no Koto kan framförallt vägleda oss att förstå samband mellan de underjordiska kristna och myter med koppling till kristendomen. Dessa har bevarats inom den lokala japanska folkliga traditionen fram till våra dagar. Den populära japanska buddhistiska modersfiguren Kannon har på många vis sammansmält med bilden av en Mariagestalt som förmedlas genom europeiska traditioner. Förvandlingen av Maria till Maria-Kannon har också inneburit att Mariagestalten har övertagit vissa buddhistiska egenskaper. Språkförbistringen beskrivs som en annan faktor som kan ha bidragit till den tidiga kristendomens förvandling i Japan. Buddhistiska termer, lånord och kristna symboler har sannolikt fått annan innebörd än den som missionärerna själv representerade. Gudsbegrepp och kopplingen till förfädernas roll inom religionen är påverkade av den lokala kulturen. This essay {{examines}} {{different perspectives}} of the myth traditions {{and the world of}} faith among the Kakure Kirishitan, and the underground Christians of Japan. Of special interest is the coming world. However, the concept of afterworld is also familiar to the domestic Buddhist tradition. Being aware of this we can better understand why the teaching of salvation (and a life after death) is the most important target of faith also for believers within the domestic tradition. The only document from the time of persecution, compiled by the Kakure themselves, is the Tenchi Hajimari no Koto, ‘The Beginning of Heaven and Earth’, a text with topics covering the creation of heaven and earth, the angels, the fall of the ancestors of humankind, Mary, the life of Christ, {{and the end of the}} world. Even if the text is not a part of the living tradition of the Kakure Kirishitan today, Tenchi Hajimari no Koto can guide us, and help us to understand the relation between the Kakure Kirishitan of Japan and European Christian tradition. Myths referred to in Tenchi Hajimari, and other local myths related to European apocryphal tradition have survived until present days as tales in areas historically populated by underground Christians. Gradually the faith of the underground Christians tended to move away from a god who was a strict father and judge. Instead they turned to a forgiving motherly “goddess” of indefinite tenderness, Mary. Deusu, the Father, is not the almighty and omniscient God we know from Christian traditions, instead he has to consult an angel about the need to save the humankind. The popular merciful Buddhist mother figure, Kannon, has in many ways fused together with the image of the Virgin Mary, rooted in European tradition. The transformation of Virgin Mary to a Maria-Kannon has infused the image with some Buddhist traits. Language confusion is described as another important factor of the acculturation of the Early Christianity of Japan. Buddhist terminology, loanwords, and the interpretation and use of Christian symbols, has most likely given the teaching a somehow different meaning, than the one represented by the early missionaries themselves. The <b>domestic</b> <b>concept</b> of gods, which connects the role of the ancestors to religion have also embraced Christianity. The faith world of Kakure Kirishitan is influenced by folk beliefs, Shintō, and the surrounding Buddhist tradition.

40|$|In the {{development}} of optical telescopes, striving to increase the penetrating power of a telescope has been always the main trend. A real way {{to solve this problem}} is to raise the quality of the image (reduction of the image angular size under real conditions of distorting factor) and increase a diameter of the main mirror. This is counteracted by the various distorting factors or interference occurring in realtime use of telescopes, as well as by complicated manufacturing processes of large mirrors. It is shown that the most effective method to deal with the influence of distorting factors on the image quality in the telescope is the minimization (through selecting the place to mount a telescope and choosing the rational optical scheme, creating materials and new technologies, improving a design, unloading the mirrors, mounting choice, etc.), and then the adaptive compensation of remaining distortions. It should be noted that a <b>domestic</b> <b>concept</b> to design large-sized telescopes allows us to use, in our opinion, the most efficient ways to do this. It means to abandon the creation of "an absolutely rigid and well-ordered" design, providing the passively aligned state telescope optics under operating conditions. The design must just have such a level of residual deformations that their effect can be efficiently compensated by the adaptive system using the segmented elements of the primary mirror and the secondary mirror as a corrector. It has been found that in the transmission optical systems to deliver laser power to a remote object, it is necessary not only to overcome the distorting effect of factors inherent in optical information systems, but, additionally, find a way to overcome a number of new difficulties. The main ones have been identified to be as follows: • the influence of laser radiation on the structure components and the propagation medium and, as a consequence, the opposite effect of the structure components and the propagation medium on the transmitted radiation WF; •  the lack of a reference source at the wavelength of trasnmitted laser radiation, which is required to implement methods for adaptive correction of the distorted WF; •  the unique to laser systems additional distorting factors available in transmission systems. These distorting factors include: • length of the optical path due to need in spatial diversity of high power laser source with a large number of matching optical elements; • thermal self-action of power laser radiation in the transport path of the radiation before its entry into forming optical system; • instability of spatio-temporal characteristics of the laser radiation source itself to take {{a turn for the worse}} conditions of radiation transmission both inside the optical path, and in the free atmosphere; • thermal irregularities and thermal deformation. It is shown that the adaptive systems differ from the active optics in that radiation wave front distortion is corrected in real time per totality of distorting factors (not only on the effect of the atmosphere) with the speed ten times exceeding the effect of distortion itself. Here, the correction quality is estimated by criterion of the primary image quality. In this case, the correction continuously takes into account data about optical system parameters such as current space, temperature, time, and adjusting, thereby supporting the high quality of images under the action of distorting factors. The paper formulates and proposes the basic postulates of adaptive correction. Postulates are a set of statements and assertions, allowing us to implement effective means of adaptive correction of distortions. The paper also shows the real capabilities the methods and means of adaptive optics offer in case of efficient use of laser radiation power and what ways are possible to solve these tasks. First of all, these are: - forming a system of assumptions and minimization of distortions in the optical path, which includes a laser cavity, a transport channel of powerful laser radiation with deflecting mirrors and a forming telescope with a segmented primary mirror; - formation of the performance criteria of adaptive optical systems; - multiplanimetric system of adaptive correction of distortions. The paper discusses test results of the transportation of powerful laser radiation on a horizontal track and shows an external view of forming optical system of comprehensive test stand. It is conclusively proven that using the proposed postulates when developing or modernizing the optical systems provides the lowest level of residual distortions and the operating efficiency of adaptive optical means. The proposed postulates for adaptive correction of radiation WF and positive experience of their use in full-scale optical complexes significantly reduce time and cost in developing the effective means to observe the distant objects, as well as the means to generate and supply power to various space objects for its multiple use such as power supply, telecommunications, fighting with space debris, providing security asteroid etc. It can be concluded that the state of the domestic optical science and its potential in the field of adaptive means to form and transport high-power laser radiation, as well as the results of theoretical and experimental studies, inspire the reasonable hope for the high-performance large-sized multipurpose optoelectronic devices to be available in the future. </p...|$|E
