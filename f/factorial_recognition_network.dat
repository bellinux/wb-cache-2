40|$|We propose using <b>recognition</b> <b>networks</b> for {{approximate}} inference inBayesian <b>networks</b> (BNs). A <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> is a multilayerperception (MLP) {{trained to}} predict posterior marginals given observedevidence {{in a particular}} BN. The input to the MLP is a vector of thestates of the evidential nodes. The activity of an output unit isinterpreted as a prediction of the posterior marginal of thecorresponding variable. The MLP is trained using samples generated fromthe corresponding BN. We evaluate a <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> that was trained to do inference ina large Bayesian network, similar in structure and complexity to theQuick Medical Reference, Decision Theoretic (QMR-DT). Our networkis a binary, two-layer, noisy-OR network containing over 4000 potentially observable nodes and over 600 unobservable, hidden nodes. Inreal medical diagnosis, most observables are unavailable, and there isa complex and unknown bias that selects which ones are provided. Weincorporate a very basic type of selection bias in our network: a knownpreference that available observables are positive rather than negative. Even this simple bias has {{a significant effect on}} the posterior. We compare the performance of our <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> tostate-of-the-art approximate inference algorithms on a large set oftest cases. In order to evaluate the effect of our simplistic modelof the selection bias, we evaluate algorithms using a variety ofincorrectly modeled observation biases. <b>Recognition</b> <b>networks</b> performwell using both correct and incorrect observation biases.

40|$|Variational {{methods that}} rely on a <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> to {{approximate}} the posterior of directed graphical models offer better inference and learning than previous methods. Recent advances that exploit the capacity and flexibility in this approach have expanded what kinds of models can be trained. However, as a proposal for the posterior, {{the capacity of the}} <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> is limited, which can constrain the representational power of the generative model and increase the variance of Monte Carlo estimates. To address these issues, we introduce an iterative refinement procedure for improving the approximate posterior of the <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> and show that training with the refined posterior is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The advantages of refinement are further evident in an increased effective sample size, which implies a lower variance of gradient estimates...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{difference}} between processing faces and other objects such as letters? What makes humans face experts, and what makes this expertise different from other identification skills? It is well known that people are very sensitive to the configural information in faces. How does the sensitivity to face configuration compare to sensitivity to configurations of other stimuli? To investigate these issues, Nishimura et al. (2004) designed a test to contrast two types of processing using the same stimuli. They primed subjects to see four blobs as either a “Y ” or as a face. Then they asked the subjects to discriminate pairs of these stimuli that differed only in small shifts in the blob locations. Although the stimuli were exactly the same, subjects were more accurate in the face condition than the “Y ” condition. With Nishimura et al., we assumed that the subjects were relying on their letter <b>recognition</b> <b>networks</b> in the “Y ” condition and their face <b>recognition</b> <b>networks</b> in the face condition to perform the task. We therefore trained two <b>networks,</b> a face <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> and a letter <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> that were otherwise identical in structure, and show here that the internal representations in the letter network for the blobs were less differentiated than the internal representations for the blobs in the face network. We argue that this is a natural consequence of the requirements of the two tasks. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for incorporating situational context information into an on-line Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) component of an Air Traffic Control (ATC) assistance system to improve recognition performance. Context information {{is treated as}} prior information to reduce the search space for recognition. It is integrated in the ASR pipeline by continually updating the <b>recognition</b> <b>network.</b> This is achieved by automatically adapting the underlying grammar whenever new situational knowledge becomes available. The context-dependent <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> is then re-created and substituted for recognition based on these context-dependent grammars. As a result, the recognizer’s search space is constantly being limited to that subset of hypotheses that are deemed plausible in the current situation.

40|$|The variational autoencoder (VAE; Kingma, Welling (2014)) is a {{recently}} proposed generative model pairing a top-down generative network with a bottom-up <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> which approximates posterior inference. It typically makes strong assumptions about posterior inference, for instance that the posterior distribution is approximately factorial, {{and that its}} parameters can be approximated with nonlinear regression from the observations. As we show empirically, the VAE objective can lead to overly simplified representations which fail to use the network's entire modeling capacity. We present the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), a generative model with the same architecture as the VAE, but which uses a strictly tighter log-likelihood lower bound derived from importance weighting. In the IWAE, the <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> uses multiple samples to approximate the posterior, giving it increased flexibility to model complex posteriors which do not fit the VAE modeling assumptions. We show empirically that IWAEs learn richer latent space representations than VAEs, leading to improved test log-likelihood on density estimation benchmarks. Comment: Submitted to ICLR 201...|$|R

Many developed approaches use deterministic signal processing. This thesis builds statistical hidden markov models (HMM) to be used in scoring. The HMM-based note models are based on the musical features pitch, accent, zero crossing rate and power. Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used to determine the probability distributions of the features. A singing database is constructed by an amateur singer who is well-trained in the area of music. During the training stage, an intra-note model is trained using the HTK toolbox. The intra-note model describes the statistical behavior of model states inside a note.

40|$|Deep {{learning}} {{methods have}} achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks. Deciding how {{to feed the}} training data is important for further performance improvement. We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning (BC learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of BC learning are not limited only {{to the increase in}} variation of the training data; BC learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that BC learning improves the performance on various sound <b>recognition</b> <b>networks,</b> datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which BC learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> (EnvNet-v 2) and train it with BC learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.

40|$|Material {{attributes}} {{have been}} shown to provide a discriminative intermediate representation for recognizing materials, especially for the challenging task of recognition from local material appearance (i. e., regardless of object and scene context). In the past, however, material attributes have been recognized separately preceding category recognition. In contrast, neuroscience studies on material perception and computer vision research on object and place recognition have shown that attributes are produced as a by-product during the category recognition process. Does the same hold true for material attribute and category recognition? In this paper, we introduce a novel material category <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> architecture to show that perceptual attributes can, in fact, be automatically discovered inside a local material recognition framework. The novel material-attribute-category convolutional neural network (MAC-CNN) produces perceptual material attributes from the intermediate pooling layers of an end-to-end trained category <b>recognition</b> <b>network</b> using an auxiliary loss function that encodes human material perception. To train this model, we introduce a novel large-scale database of local material appearance organized under a canonical material category taxonomy and careful image patch extraction that avoids unwanted object and scene context. We show that the discovered attributes correspond well with semantically-meaningful visual material traits via Boolean algebra, and enable recognition of previously unseen material categories given only a few examples.
