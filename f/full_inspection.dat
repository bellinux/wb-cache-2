5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its target, so that the target would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) of the target. If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video of the target and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of the target would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) of the target for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at different angles. After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E

25|$|During Aspin's {{term the}} U.S. was {{concerned}} that Communist North Korea might have underway a nuclear weapons development program. This gave way to alarm when that country refused to allow <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of nuclear sites. In November 1993 North Korea demanded that the United States and South Korea cancel a planned joint training exercise as a precondition during discussions on the nuclear issue. Aspin rejected this demand and announced that the United States would suspend plans to withdraw its troops gradually from the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2015, a 15-year-old {{girl and}} a 26-year-old woman were injured after a foot-rail {{dislodged}} while in motion and landed in the queue for the ride. The 15-year-old girl was taken to Scarborough General Hospital where she received treatment for her head injuries, whereas the 26-year-old woman was treated at the scene. Although both have sustained head injuries, North Yorkshire Police released a statement claiming that neither was life-threatening. The ride has {{been taken out of}} operation in accordance with Flamingo Land's operational procedures, and is undergoing a <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> in conjunction with North Yorkshire Police and the HSE (Health and Safety Executive).|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E

25|$|Contractors Noel Fitzpatrick {{working for}} British Waterways managed {{to reopen the}} road {{within a week of}} the breach occurring. British Waterways {{announced}} on 5 November 2007 that a 16-mile (26km) stretch of the canal from Llanover to Llangynidr would be drained completely, so that a <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of the canal structure could be carried out. They stated that they were working with boat owners to move all boats to parts of the canal which would not be affected by this drainage, but that the towpath would remain open during this phase. Subsequently, they announced that a full geotechnical survey would be carried out, and that they expected the stretch to be closed for up to a year. Water levels on this section were reduced significantly, but engineers were then faced with the task of moving upwards of 100,000 fish before it could be drained fully.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{month of}} moving into the Governor's Mansion, Brown noticed {{significant}} deterioration in the wiring and ordered a <b>full</b> <b>inspection.</b> The Department of Buildings and Construction's preliminary report stated [...] "If this was a privately operated structure, this office would have no alternative other than to give the operator 30 to 60 days to rewire the structure." [...] The report {{went on to say}} that the mansion was a virtual firetrap. Upon receiving the report, Brown immediately moved his family out of the mansion and back to Cave Hill, his estate in Lexington. The Department of Buildings and Construction forbade use of the mansion for overnight purposes or group meetings until repairs could be made. Brown's Cave Hill estate was officially designated the temporary executive mansion, and the state agreed to furnish Brown's groceries, reimburse him for entertaining official guests, and pay for telephone calls made in his capacity as governor. He was also given a travel allowance.|$|E
500|$|While {{en route}} to Samoa {{on the night of}} 2324 March 1899, Cormoran ran aground on the Whirlwind Reef, north of the western tip of New Pomerania. She was stuck on the reef amidships, so that her bow was {{sticking}} about a meter out of the water. The crew attempted to lighten the ship by removing coal and ammunition, but she remained grounded on the reef. The ship's commander, Korvettenkapitän Hugo Emsmann, sent the steam pinnace and a dinghy with two officers and eleven men, towing a load of coal, to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, some [...] away. There, they met the steamer , which arrived on the scene on 29 March. Emsmann then decided to remove all unnecessary coal and ammunitionsome of which was put ashore and the rest simply thrown overboardto cut away the fore and mainmast, and to move the stern guns forward. These measures allowed the ship to float free from the reef. The crew then re-stowed the supplies that had been sent ashore before returning to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen. There, her seaworthiness was inspected, and additional supplies were brought aboard. Cormoran then steamed to Sydney for dry-docking; a <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of her hull revealed that it had only been slightly damaged. Repairs lasted until early June.|$|E

It was easy {{enough on the}} night of the arrival, in the midst of excitement, when blood was warm, for Anne to be {{resolute}} in her avoidance of Bob Loveday. But in the morning determination is apt to grow invertebrate; rules of pugnacity are less easily acted up to, and a feeling of live and let live takes possession of the gentle soul. Anne had not meant even to sit down to the same breakfast-table with Bob; but when the rest were assembled, and had got some way through the substantial repast which was served at this hour in the miller's house, Anne entered. She came silently as a phantom, her eyes cast down, her cheeks pale. It was a good long walk from the door to the table, and Bob made a <b>full</b> <b>inspection</b> of her as she came up to a chair at the remotest corner, in the direct rays of the morning light, where she dumbly sat herself down.|$|E
