25|$|Hiro Protagonist is {{a hacker}} and pizza {{delivery}} driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier), during a {{failed attempt to}} make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a <b>datafile</b> named Snow Crash {{by a man named}} Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research, positing connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture and the legend of Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.|$|E
