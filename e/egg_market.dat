This paper focuses on the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price forecasting methods {{in order to increase}} the predication accuracy. A market price forecasting expert system for the poultry and eggs based on neural network is proposed in this paper to build the market data system of the poultry and eggs in the supply chain. According to the neural network estimation model based on the data, the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price can be accurately predicted. The experiment illustrates the improved algorithm can predicate the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price in the supply chain, which can increase the accuracy and meet the practical demands in poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the impact}} of common labels is {{investigated}} with both theoretical and empirical approaches. Recent statistics regarding the <b>egg</b> <b>market</b> in France suggest that retailer brands largely adopt common labels. A simple theoretical framework enables us to determine {{the conditions under which}} producers and/or retailers with different product qualities decide to post a common label on their products. In particular, a situation of multiple equilibria (one where the label is used by the high-quality seller only and one where it is used by the low-quality seller only) is exhibited when the cost of the label is relatively large. The demand is then estimated for different segments of the French <b>egg</b> <b>market,</b> including producer/retailer brands with/without common labels. The estimates are used to derive expenditure and price elasticities and allow us to calculate welfare measures revealing a relatively large willingness-to-pay for labels. competition, demand estimation, labels, product differentiation. ...|$|E

40|$|The egg {{industry}} in Australia is characterised by markets {{in which both}} price and output are regulated by state marketing boards. With prices set {{on the basis of}} estimates of average costs, together with a guaranteed market for output, producers enjoy monopoly rents. These rents are reflected in the price paid for (transferable) hen quotas sold on the open market. Because the egg industry is becoming concentrated into fewer production units, the benefits of regulation are increasingly accruing to larger producers. This, together with the implication of imposing average cost pricing on consumers, suggests scope for a change in government policy towards egg industry deregulation. These issues are discussed with specific reference to the <b>egg</b> <b>market</b> in South Australia. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{problems}} existing in the poultry meat and <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> in Nairobi is investigated. Particular emphasis is directed towards revealing the structUre of the retailing and wholesaling systems for both poultry meat and eggs. In addition, sources of supply, marketing channels and functions performed at various levels 1 n the marketing of the different products are indicated. Producers and consumers were not interviewed and, hence, the discussion on supply and demand fluctuations and their effect on wholesale and retail prices is based on non-quantitative {{information provided by the}} retailers. _ Finally the price-setting determinants at wholesale and retail levels are looked into. The term 'poultry' has been adopted and is used synonymously to the term 'chicken'. This is due to the insignificance of other kinds of poultry (e. g. turkeys, duck and geese) in the Nairobi Market. A further distinction Is made within the poultry industry with respect to types of products marketed. Two broad categories of chicken are distingu~shed. These are the 'soft chicken referred to as 'broilers' and thc'tough-meated ones referred to as 'boilers' or 'backyard' Chicken. The types of consumers (private households or' institutions and hotels) and the nature of competition between the 'broiLer pr~ducts ~nd backyard chicken are investigated. Various important aspects forming the background to the study are discussed briefly in Chapter 1. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 are devoted to introductory remarks about the existing problems in the poultry meat and <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> in Nairobi, objectives of the study and research methodology respectively.
