40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the morphological {{changes of the}} anterior segment using ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM) imaging in pseudophakic patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with silicone oil or gas (C 3 F 8) internal tamponade agent injection. Method. This prospective study included pseudophakic patients with planned PPV, {{divided into two groups}} according to internal tamponade agent: those in which silicone oil was used (n= 27, Group 1) and those in which gas (C 3 F 8) was used (n= 24, Group 2). UBM measurements were performed in the supine position before and one week after surgery. Results. In patients of Group 1, postoperative trabecular meshwork-ciliary process distance (T-CPD) and iris-ciliary process distance (I-CPD), according <b>to</b> preoperative values, <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significantly</b> reduced, and postoperative mean value of scleral thickness (ST) and intraocular pressure (IOP), according <b>to</b> preoperative value, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significantly</b> increased. In patients of Group 2, postoperative mean values of anterior chamber depth (ACD), ciliary body thickness (CBT), T-CPD, I-CPD, and IOP, according <b>to</b> preoperative values, <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significantly</b> reduced. Preoperatively, in Group 2 patients, according to Group 1 patients, TIA and IOP <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>significantly</b> increased. Preoperative and postoperative IOP between the measured parameters with UBM showed no statistically significant correlation. Conclusions. Gases cause more morphological changes in the anterior segment structures. It is thought that complications such as increased intraocular pressure can be seen more frequently for this reason...|$|R
25|$|The dental {{analysis}} for the Moatfield population focused on patterns of caries (cavities), abscessing, wear, and antemortem tooth loss. Dental analysis was divided into two study collections due to the disarticulated nature of the remains: maxillary specimens and madibular specimens. The general patterns observed evidenced greater caries and antemortem loss in the madibular collection, and more abscessing in the maxillary collection. Caries were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> lower in women, {{with an increase in}} caries corresponding to an increase in age. Men evidenced a higher number in caries with no discernible changes related to age. Attrition was found to be moderate. Abscessing quantification is ambiguous at best as it does not adequately account for areas of antemortem tooth loss.|$|E
25|$|Dysregulation of {{apoptosis}} (programmed cell death) {{is believed}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in SS is controversial. Both the Fas and Fas ligand proteins are overexpressed in primary SS patients, while expression of BCL-1, which is known to downregulate apoptosis, was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> reduced in acinar and ductal epithelial cells of SS patients compared to healthy people. In situ studies did not show increased apoptosis among glandular epithelial cells, but did show reduced apoptosis among infiltrating mononuclear cells. Reduced apoptosis was also implicated in the accumulation of autoreactive B-cells found in the glands. The relationship of autoantibodies expressed in SS with apoptosis is still being researched.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{a lack of}} a {{coherent}} definition for South Asia resulted in not only a lack of academic studies, but also in a lack interest for such studies.

However, no such decline was seen in subjects who had formerly been heavy cannabis users and had stopped taking the drug. The authors concluded that cannabis does not have a long-term effect on intelligence. However this is contradicted by the long term longitudinal study, carried out by Otago and Duke universities,which found that regular use of marijuana in teenage years affects IQ in adulthood even when the use stops. The drop in IQ was 8 points. Adults smoking marijuana had no lasting effect on IQ. Effects on fetal development are minimal when compared with the well-documented adverse effects of tobacco or alcohol use.|$|E
25|$|In current research, the {{significant}} relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied. An imbalance of the immune system, in particular of cytokine metabolism {{has been identified as}} playing a role in the pathophysiology of the hangover state. Especially the hangover symptoms nausea, headache, and fatigue have been suggested to be mediated by changes in the immune system. The concentration of several cytokines have been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> increased in the blood after alcohol consumption. These include interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Some pharmacological studies such as on tolfenamic acid and Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) have also indicated an involvement of the immune system. These studies suggest that the presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as aspirin or ibuprofen.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} archaeological {{evidence}} of usage was in Kariandusi and other sites of the Acheulian age (beginning 1.5 million years BP) dated 700,000 BC, {{although the number of}} objects found at these sites were very low relative to the Neolithic.

Anatolian sources of obsidian are known to have been the material used in the Levant and modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan from a time beginning sometime about 12,500 BC. The first attested civilized use is dated to the late fifth millennium BC, known from excavations at Tell Brak. Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture. It was also polished to create early mirrors. Modern archaeologists have developed a relative dating system, obsidian hydration dating, to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts.|$|E

25|$|The {{volume of}} SDN in medial preoptic area is {{modified}} by hormones, among which testosterone is {{proved to be}} of much importance. The larger volume of male SDN is correlated to the higher concentration of fetal testosterone level in males than in females. Also, {{there is evidence that}} testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). The effect of testosterone is also reflected by the influence of fetal intrauterine position on the morphology of SDN-POA. Studies demonstrated that male rats which were gestated between two male fetuses (2M) have 2-fold larger SDN-POA volumes than those gestated between two female fetuses (2F). At the same time, the testosterone levels, as well as the 17β-estradiol (product of testosterone) levels, were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> larger in 2M males than in 2F males on gestation day 21 (testosterone can be transferred from adjacent male fetuses to the target rats). However, evidence fails to show any relationship between SDN volume and female fetal position.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD have been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver {{were significantly more likely to}} experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{high doses}} of SRIs are needed for {{effectiveness}} {{in the treatment of}} OCD. Studies have found that high dosages of SSRIs above the normally recommended maximums are significantly more effective in OCD treatment than lower dosages (e.g., 250 to 400mg/day sertraline versus 200mg/day sertraline). In addition, the combination of clomipramine and SSRIs has also been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>significantly</b> more effective in alleviating OCD symptoms, and clomipramine is commonly used to augment SSRIs for this reason. Studies have found that intravenous clomipramine, which is associated with very high circulating concentrations of the drug and a much higher ratio of clomipramine to its metabolite desmethylclomipramine, is more effective than oral clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. There is a case report of complete remission from OCD for approximately one month following a massive overdose of fluoxetine, an SSRI with a uniquely long duration of action. Taken together, stronger serotonin reuptake inhibition has consistently been associated with greater alleviation of OCD symptoms, and since clomipramine, at the clinical dosages in which it is employed, is effectively the strongest SRI used medically (see table above), this may underlie its unique effectiveness in the treatment of OCD.|$|E
