25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally opened it to traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With this extraordinary increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the ability to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> a show while also connecting with neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E

500|$|A peasant {{told the}} social activist Danilo Dolci in the 1950s how the {{situation}} was in Villalba after the Americans had landed: the Mafia [...] "robbed the storehouses of the agrarian Co-op and the army’s storehouses; sold food, clothes, cars and lorries in Palermo on the black market. In Villalba all power was in their hands: church, Mafia, agricultural banks, latifundia, all {{in the hands of}} the same family … One used to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him and ask 'Can you do me this favour?' even for a little affair one had with some other person."' ...|$|E

Ben Ata returns with a large army and enters Zone Three unchallenged. He is not well received, but finds Al•Ith with {{a small band of}} followers who have moved to the frontier of Zone Two to be close to her.

500|$|Lyricist Tim Rice, who {{was working}} with {{composer}} Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin, was invited to write the songs, and accepted {{on the condition of}} finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John, after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina från Duvemåla. John expressed an interest in writing [...] "ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book, where he felt the [...] "music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, [...] "Sex usually makes her forget about everything else that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found {{that she did not}} contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going through everything together".|$|E

500|$|With little {{care for}} his studies and [...] "itching {{for a chance to}} <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> some excitement", Tracy enlisted in the United States Navy when he turned 18. He was sent to the Naval Training Station in North Chicago, where he was still a student when World War I came to an end. He {{achieved}} the rank of seaman second class, but never went to sea, and was discharged in February 1919. John Tracy's desire to see one of his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma. Studies at two more institutions, plus the additional allowance of [...] "war credits", won Tracy a place at Ripon College. He entered Ripon in February 1921, declaring his intention to major in medicine.|$|E
500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. <b>Go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him ... and tell {{everybody}} that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, {{but one of the}} most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky." [...] To other friends he wrote [...] "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A theatrical masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opening night}} {{audience}} was also delighted by the piece, preferring it {{even to the}} Offenbach work: [...] "To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary {{on the part of}} the audience, Trial by Jury suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [...] [...] On the contrary, it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm." [...] A reviewer noted that [...] "Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action ...to a temporary standstill." [...] Another paper summed up its popular appeal: [...] "Trial by Jury is but a trifle–it pretends to be nothing more–but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go to see and hear, which they will laugh at, and which they will advise their friends to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see,</b> and therefore its success cannot be doubtful." ...|$|E

500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, actors Tom Sturridge, Teresa Palmer, and Jamie Bell {{were cast}} for Jumper with Sturridge {{in the lead}} role. The {{following}} July, actor Samuel L. Jackson was cast as an Rolan Cox, with producer Simon Kinberg rewriting the original screenplay draft by Goyer. Principal photography was scheduled {{to take place in}} Tokyo, Rome, Toronto, and New York. Production was stopped in June 2006 after producer Tom Rothman told Liman [...] "The lead is 18. Wouldn't the movie be better if he was 25? You have a huge movie here and adults won't <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> an 18-year-old. They'll consider it a children's movie. You could make a bigger movie than that." [...] Liman agreed on casting older actors for furthering the romantic aspect of the film. In August, actor Hayden Christensen replaced Sturridge in the lead role as David just two weeks before the beginning of shooting, as the studio [...] "became concerned about not having a more prominent actor in their trio of young stars." [...] After Christensen was recast for the lead role, Liman replaced Palmer with Rachel Bilson.|$|E
500|$|The {{last three}} decades of Moore's life {{continued}} in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition {{in the summer of}} 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary [...] "5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)" [...] by American filmmaker Warren Forma. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed Knife Edge Two Piece in 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London. According to Moore, [...] "When I was offered the site near the House of Lords... I liked the place so much that I didn't bother to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> an alternative site in Hyde Park—one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park. The House of Lords site is quite different. It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it." ...|$|E
