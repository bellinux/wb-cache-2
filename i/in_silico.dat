5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and <b>in</b> <b>silico.</b> In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. <b>In</b> <b>silico</b> studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E
5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating treatments unique to each patient.|$|E
5|$|CASS4 (Crk {{associated}} substrate 4) is {{the fourth}} and last described member of the CAS protein family. CASS4 was detected by Singh et al. in 2008 following <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> screening of databases describing expressed sequence tags from an evolutionarily diverse group of organisms, using the CAS-related proteins (p130Cas, NEDD9/HEF1 and EFS) mRNAs as templates. Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (√Ö) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

25|$|Simcyp‚Äôs Simulators allow <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> {{prediction}} of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and potential drug-drug interactions.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{annotation}} tools try {{to perform}} these steps <b>in</b> <b>silico,</b> {{as opposed to}} manual annotation (a.k.a. curation) which involves human expertise and potential experimental verification. Ideally, these approaches co-exist and complement {{each other in the}} same annotation pipeline (also see below).|$|E
25|$|Lead-Finder is {{intended}} {{to meet the requirements}} of computational and medicinal chemists involved in drug discovery, pharmacologists and toxicologists involved in the evaluation of ADMET properties <b>in</b> <b>silico,</b> and biochemists and enzymologists working on modeling protein-ligand interactions, enzyme specificity and rational enzyme design.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{geometry of}} both rotamers {{can be obtained}} experimentally by high resolution infrared spectroscopy augmented with <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> work. In accordance with the model described above, the carbon‚Äìcarbon bond length is higher for the anti-rotamer (151.4 pm vs. 150). The steric repulsion between the fluorine atoms in the gauche rotamer causes increased CCF bond angles (by 3.2¬∞) and increased FCCF dihedral angles (from the default 60¬∞ to 71¬∞).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When raster graphics became affordable, {{one of the common}} approaches was to replicate CPK models <b>in</b> <b>silico.</b> It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the molecular volume can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|The {{products}} of the Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation {{are believed to be}} controlled through both primary and secondary stereoelectronic effects. The primary stereoelectronic effect in the Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation refers to the necessity of the oxygen-oxygen bond in the peroxide group to be antiperiplanar to the group that migrates. This orientation facilitates optimum overlap of the ùõî orbital of the migrating group to the ùõî* orbital of the peroxide group. The secondary stereoelectronic effect refers to the necessity of the lone pair on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group to be antiperiplanar to the migrating group. This allows for optimum overlap of the oxygen nonbonding orbital with the ùõî* orbital of the migrating group. This migration step is also (at least <b>in</b> <b>silico)</b> assisted by two or three peroxyacid units enabling the hydroxyl proton to shuttle to its new position.|$|E
25|$|In one study, the {{mechanism}} is established <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> {{taking into account}} the presence of solvent molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involves three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an oxonium ion). In the transition state leading to the iminium ion (œÉ-complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a concerted reaction and the hydroxyl group is expulsed. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by the three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and the proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the N-methyl acetimidic acid, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the amide.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{generation}} of the gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos discussed above, mouse embryos were also being generated that contained only small regions that were derived from either a paternal or maternal source. The generation of a series of such uniparental disomies, which together span the entire genome, allowed the creation of an imprinting map. Those regions which when inherited from a single parent result in a discernible phenotype contain imprinted gene(s). Further research showed that within these regions there were often numerous imprinted genes. Around 80% of imprinted genes are found in clusters such as these, called imprinted domains, suggesting a level of co-ordinated control. More recently, genome-wide screens to identify imprinted genes have used differential expression of mRNAs from control fetuses and parthenogenetic or androgenetic fetuses hybridized to expression arrays, allele-specific gene expression using SNP genotyping arrays, transcriptome sequencing, and <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> prediction pipelines.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the precise}} {{structure}} or peptide sequence of a molecule is deciphered through {{the set of}} fragment masses, the interpretation of mass spectra requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation or software assisted interpretation of mass spectra must be performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An a priori structural information is fragmented <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and proteins.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{chemistry}} is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the {{scientific study of}} the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials. Study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated forms. The study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g., natural products, drugs, polymers, etc.) by chemical synthesis, as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules, both in the laboratory and via theoretical (<b>in</b> <b>silico)</b> study.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} complexity of regulation of cellular processes and the roles proteases play in them, bioinformatics {{continues to be an}} invaluable tool for degradomics. Software, databases, and projects developed for this purpose have accompanied the advancement in technology. Software developed in the Overall Lab (CLIPPER) statistically evaluates cleavage site candidates determined by degradomic approaches. One web-based data site, WebPICS, incorporates and integrates cleavage site analysis from PICS experiments into MEROPS, the protease database. Another database, Termini oriented protein Function Inferred Database (TopFIND), serves as a knowledge base to integrate protein termini formed by protease processing with functional interpretations. By combining research literature and other biological databases including UniProt, MEROPS, Ensembl, and TisDB, the database comprehensively renders protein termini modifications accessible to a broad scientific community. Using TopFIND, terminal modifications can be identified and visualized across proteins thanks to all available <b>in</b> <b>silico,</b> in vitro, and in vivo findings. Using TopFINDer and Path FINDer software, research findings can be mathematically modelled into a network of pathways regulated by proteases, further contributing to the ‚Äúprotease web‚Äù.|$|E
25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. Molecules {{containing}} argon can be van der Waals molecules held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study stretching and bending movements, microwave spectroscopy and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. Mass spectroscopy is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of <b>in</b> <b>silico</b> study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment. This article is mostly based on experimental or observational results.|$|E
