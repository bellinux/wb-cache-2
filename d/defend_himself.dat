5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak {{on the subject of the}} attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E

5|$|If {{the late}} queen would have {{believed}} her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs and oranges as in old times.

5|$|Some {{critics argue}} that Swift {{did not need to}} <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter {{encourages}} the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.|$|E

5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E

5|$|Light gun {{shooters}} primarily {{revolve around}} shooting {{large numbers of}} enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist {{may be required to}} <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> in print.|$|E

5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus.

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set inside an ancient Egyptian tomb. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to escape the tomb, the Great Sphinx, before all oxygen runs out. To achieve this end, the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors, solve logic puzzles and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them. The tomb has seven floors. Pendragon's only form of defence is his whip, which he can utilise to <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> from enemies. The player also has access to a torch, which {{will allow them to}} see in certain pitch-black areas of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E

5|$|Tucker {{was asked}} for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, {{borrowing}} the remainder {{from members of}} the academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation. Later he was required to <b>defend</b> <b>himself</b> in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was insane {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, and where it is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively <b>defend</b> <b>himself.</b> The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A {{year after the}} war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged {{in a fight with}} William Falkner because he thought that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the Sons of Temperance. Robert Hindman tried to <b>defend</b> <b>himself,</b> but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee Appeal.|$|E
