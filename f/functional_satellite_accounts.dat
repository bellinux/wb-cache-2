40|$|Economic Accounting is {{relatively}} well developed in Norway {{especially on the}} national level, {{but also on the}} regional level. <b>Satellite</b> <b>accounting</b> is used for focusing certain features of the economy, a. o. for tourism. A <b>satellite</b> <b>account</b> for tourism has been developed on the national level. Because the tourists'activities are regional activities, and because the impacts of tourism are significant not only on the national, but also on the regional level, a regional <b>satellite</b> <b>account</b> for tourism was developed by us during the past two years. Such <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> on the regional level are, to our knowledge, not developed worldwide. The data can a. o. be used for moderating existing input-output models, so they can become more tailor-made for analysing impacts of tourists' economic activities. We propose a paper that focuses on our work - methods for regionalising <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> for tourism, - indicators applied for this regionalisation, - how regional <b>satellite</b> <b>account</b> figures can be adapted into existing input-output models of the Norwegian economy (on the regional level), and - an example, showing how the regional <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> for tourism can be used for simulating the regional impacts of tourism by the use of input-output techniques. ...|$|R

Based upon a general interregional quantity model for tourism, empirical evidence on the impacts of tourism on 98 Danish municipalities is presented.

40|$|The Household <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> aims to make visible the {{non-market}} production of households, {{which is only}} partially covered in the National Accounts. All economic analyses depend on systematic data compiled in a given, structured format. However, no such data have been available for household production, so far. The purpose of the <b>satellite</b> <b>account</b> is to fill this gap. The Household <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> measures and describes {{the value of the}} goods and services produced by households for their own final consumption. The main part of household production is outside the scope of GDP. <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> is conceptually consistent with the core national accounts, and it enables to produce extended national accounts that include both core accounts and household production. Such extended national accounts give a somewhat different picture of economic development than the core national accounts. They are of particular interest in the analysis of long-term economic development or in the comparison of levels of production in different economies. The Finnish Household <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> has been compiled in compliance with Eurostat and SNA 93 guidelines. Some effort has also been made to further develop the Eurostat method. Accounts have been compiled for ten different types of households and for different principal functions of household production, i. e. providing housing, meals and snacks, clothing, care, and volunteer work. Also shopping and travel related to unpaid work are shown separately. The Finnish Household <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> describes household production in 2001. Production not included in the national accounts is valued by using the input method. The data sources used in compiling the account were Statistics Finland's Time Use Survey in 1999 - 2000, the 2001 - 2002 Household Budget Survey, wage and salary statistics as well as National Accounts figures for 2001. The total output value of household production in 2001 was 81. 6 billion euros. Gross value added in household production was 62. 8 billion euros, of which 13 per cent was included in the national accounts. The GDP is increased by 40 per cent and household consumption by almost 60 per cent when production excluded from the national accounts are included in the figures. Among the various principal functions of household production, the highest gross value added figure was recorded for housing. Its share was 43 per cent of all household production. Meals and snacks accounted 27 per cent of household production. The volume of output varied in different types of households. Output was highest in families with small children and lowest in young single-person households. Output increased markedly with the age of the household's reference person, both among people living alone and couples. Household structure and the age of household members had a greater impact on output than gross household income. Extended national accounts time series will provide a valuable tool for monitoring changes in economic development. In the future the aim is to compile household <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> on a regular basis at a five-year interval or more often using data from the national accounts, the Household Budget Survey and the Time Use Survey...|$|R

40|$|National {{income is}} an {{indicator}} of the economic progress of the nation. Although the extraction of non-renewable resources lowers the quantity of the asset available to future generations, and results in a permanent loss of income generating capacity, this loss is not reflected in the System of National Accounts (SNA) income accounts. This deficiency has been recognised internationally by national accountants and work has been underway to develop frameworks and methods to take account of depletion of natural assets in a "satellite account". <b>Satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> provide a framework linked to the central national accounts, enabling attention to be focussed on a certain aspect of social or economic life or to vary the standard concepts to suit particular studies {{within the context of the}} national <b>accounts.</b> In a <b>satellite</b> <b>account</b> the depletion of natural assets can be considered as analogous to the depreciation of produced goods, whereby the current value of the stock of fixed assets declines from normal use. Depletion is not the only cause of change in the level of available resource stocks. New discoveries of sub-soil assets may increase the economically demonstrated stock of a resource so that the level of currently exploitable reserves from which the economic valuation is derived is not falling. New discoveries can also be brought into an alternative concept of income in a <b>satellite</b> <b>account.</b> This paper defines depletion and discoveries of natural assets, and discusses the conceptual framework underlying the measurement of depletion and discoveries, how adjustments for depletion and discoveries might be calculated, and how the national accounts might be adjusted for depletion of and additions to natural assets.
