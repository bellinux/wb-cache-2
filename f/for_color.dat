5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time <b>for</b> <b>color</b> fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours <b>for</b> <b>color</b> fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically <b>for</b> <b>color</b> television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known <b>for</b> <b>color</b> and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E

5|$|During the film's pre-production, Schliessler was {{inspired}} by British-American photojournalist Tim Hetherington's war photography book Infidel, which details a single U.S. platoon assigned to an outpost in the Korengal Valley {{during the war in}} Afghanistan. The book's images became a guide to creating the overall look of the film after Schliessler had shown them to Berg, as well as the art and costume departments. Prior to filming, Schleissler and Berg shot test footage with the digital cameras and brought it to digital colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld at post-production facility Company 3 <b>for</b> <b>color</b> grading.|$|E

Others considered for the job were John Pollock, Mauro Ranallo and Kevin Nash, before GFW settled on Matt Striker.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code <b>for</b> <b>color</b> receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E

5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells <b>for</b> <b>color</b> perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except <b>for</b> <b>color.</b> Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder <b>for</b> <b>color.</b> He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E

Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load <b>for</b> <b>Color</b> Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK91 million, or NOK1 million each day. For the whole year, Color Air had an average ticket price of NOK453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million. NOK45 million was used on taxes, giving NOK12 million to cover operating costs of NOK209 million. The company lost NOK197 million in 1998.|$|E
