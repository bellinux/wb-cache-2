40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{problems}} related to orthogonal <b>fluxgates</b> realized using magnetic microwires as core. Starting from a description of orthogonal <b>fluxgates</b> evolution, we give a theoretical analysis of the problems involving the full saturation of the wire, necessary condition to obtain proper working conditions. Bi-metallic wires (magnetic layer on copper wire, carrying the excitation current) have been proposed to achieve full saturation using lower current. In this paper, we present a further improvement: we realized microwires with insulation layer between the copper wire and the magnetic layer. The current flows only into the copper, regardless of the working frequency. Using insulation layer, we achieve 20 mA saturation current at 10 kHz, which is 3 times smaller than for similar wires without insulation layer...|$|R

However, magnetic compasses are still widely in use {{as they can be}} small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, are often easier to use than GPS, require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g. trees, that can block the reception of electronic signals.|$|E
25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise <b>fluxgate</b> magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

Therefore, we conclude that electroplating under torsion is the most promising method for manufacturing microwires for coil-less <b>fluxgates.</b> Copyright © 2013 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} method for low perming error of <b>fluxgates</b> is {{to enlarge the}} peak value of the excitation current, but large amplitude excitation will increase the power consumption. A narrow pulse excitation current with sufficient peak value can reduce perming error with low power consumption while increase {{the difficulty of the}} signal processing with low sensitivity. The perfected excitation waveform with high ratio of peak value to RMS value by careful excitation tuning is an efficient solution. This paper presents a novel circuit which can generate an excitation current waveform with high peak value and low RMS value for <b>fluxgates.</b> Different from the tuned excitation circuit, the proposed circuit is a combination of an integrator and a differentiator with the same squarewave input. The excitation signal is the sum of a triangle wave and a sharp narrow pulse signal. It is easy to adjust the peak value of the narrow pulses for perming error study and no careful tune adjusting is needed. Finally, in case of the fixed peak value of the narrow pulses, an improved excitation circuit with only two resistors, two capacitors and one amplifier is also presented in the paper. The experiment results show that 0. 5 nT perming error can be achieved for 10 mT shock...|$|R
40|$|The {{extension}} of small, inexpensive, low-power, low-frequency, ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors to fields between 1 nT and 1 pT, an area currently dominated by <b>fluxgates,</b> optically pumped magnetometers, and SQUIDS, {{would be a}} paradigm shift for the field of magnetic sensors. The necessary elements for picoTesla magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ) sensors have been identified by modeling the noise characteristics. The results help identify the experimental challenges involved in the integration of these necessary elements into actual sensors, illustrate the trade-offs faced if there are losses in performance upon integration. Scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA) of the pinned layer provides insights into problems and possible solutions. Issues associated with real-world applications of these sensors to ultra-low field measurements are discussed. © 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{were able}} to gather little from the wreckage, most of which was {{severely}} damaged by the crash and the subsequent flash fire. The only instrument with readable settings which could be salvaged was the <b>fluxgate</b> compass, which was used to confirm the aircraft's heading. Propeller marks on the cliff face also confirmed the aircraft's heading and indicated that the aircraft was pitched nose upwards as it tried to climb. The propellers themselves were broken in such a fashion to indicate that they were functioning normally at impact. It was impossible to determine, however, the aircraft's speed {{at the time of}} the crash due to a lack of surviving instruments. Investigators were also able to determine that all of the damage to the plane was incurred during or after the crash; there was no indication of a midair mechanical failure.|$|E

40|$|A Neel Effect ® {{current sensor}} {{featuring}} a double toroidal core is proposed. The measurement {{relies on the}} application of a harmonic excitation to the magnetic core and on the sensing of the magnetic flux density variations {{in the presence of a}} current to measure.

40|$|Magnetic iron {{nanoparticles}} {{embedded in}} insulating oxides matrices are prized targets for 2 ̆ 2 on chip 2 ̆ 2 magnetic sensors, nano <b>fluxgates</b> and nano hard magnets. In this study, the nucleation {{and growth of}} iron nanoparticles in the near surface region of 400 nm silica thin films (on silicon substrates) during ion implantation and post- implantation electron beam annealing was systematically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fe L-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). Results show the presence of Fe oxides after low-fluence low-energy ion implantation in Si 02, suggesting that initially Fe substitutes for Si in the silica matrix. Larger Fe fluences lead {{to the formation of}} sub- 2 nm metallic Fe nuclei. Postimplantation annealing transformed the dispersed cationic Fe species into metallic Fe nanoclusters (diameter 1110 nm) that are stabilized by a thin passivating surface oxide film.

40|$|Magnetic bar-code is {{composed}} from ferromagnetic bars printed on a substrate. The amount of ferromagnetic material is low, therefore reading magnetic barcode requires sensitive methods. Principle of methods of sensing both low-intensity magnetic field (<b>fluxgates)</b> and detecting low concentration of ferromagnetic material (resonant circuit, differential sensor) will be described. There are sensors producing frequency-modulated signal, therefore {{we focus on}} frequency demodulators as well. Signal acquired by sensor suffers from convolution distortion, reconstruction methods will be introduced. The assembled device consists of sensing oscillator, frequency demodulator, amplifier and reconstructing circuit. Frequency demodulation is done by phase-locked loop or differential demodulator. Reconstruction is based on detection of inflection points, producing square signal (representing bars of barcode). Design of these blocks is described. The device is able to read magnetic barcodes and reconstruct convolutionary distorted acquired signal. The differential demodulator exhibits low noise and low temperature drift (contrary to phase-locked loop). Signal produced by reading 2 mm wide bars is reconstructed without any problems, bars of width less than 1 mm cause troubles in certain cases (due to high degree of convolution distortion) ...|$|R

40|$|In magnetopneumography (MPG), we scan weak {{remanent}} {{magnetic fields}} (in {{the range of}} nT) of ferromagnetic dust deposited in the lungs of affected workers. This is carried out in an unshielded lab. Variations of the background field during the scanning period bias the inversion process, i. e., the estimation of the magnetic sources from the measured field. We present an innovative mathematical technique of finding a field equation uniquely describing the magnetic moments in the nodes of the measurement space. Simultaneously, it enables the tracking {{of the values of}} the disturbing gradient created by external distant sources during the time of scanning. Our method preserves the first-order gradients obtained in multiple layers (scan heights above the object) instead of losing data with the higher order gradients which are not effective here. Six coaxially aligned <b>fluxgates</b> were used for scanning the field maps. The obtained five first-order gradients for each node give us the parameters of the respective ldquoequivalentrdquo magnetic sources. Furthermore, we obtain a parameter describing the error originating mainly from the background field.

40|$|Model {{projections}} of ice flow {{in a changing}} climate are dependent on model inputs such as surface elevation, bedrock position or surface temperatures, among others. Of all these inputs, geothermal heat flux is the one for which uncertainty is greatest. In the area of Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, available data sets differ by up to a factor of 2. 5. Here, we evaluate the impact of such uncertainty on ice flow, using sampling analyses based on the Latin-Hypercube method. First, we quantify the impact of geothermal heat flux errors on ice hardness, a thermal parameter that critically controls the magnitude of ice flow. Second, we quantify {{the impact of the}} same errors on mass balance, specifically on the mass flux advecting through thirteen <b>fluxgates</b> distributed across Pine Island Glacier. We contrast our Results with similar uncertainties generated by errors in the specification of ice thickness. Model outputs indicate that geothermal heat flux errors yield uncertainties on ice hardness on the order of 5 - 7 %, with maximum uncertainty reaching 15 %. Resulting uncertainties in mass balance remain however below 1 %. We discuss the uncertainty distribution and its relationship to the amount of heat available {{at the base of the}} ice sheet from friction, viscous and geothermal heating. We also show that comparatively, errors in ice thickness contribute more to model uncertainty than errors in geothermal heat flux, especially for fast-flowing ice streams. © 2012.
