25|$|The {{burden of}} proof in a {{proceeding}} to obtain a writ of coram nobis is upon the applicant claiming the error, and the alleged error of fact must be such as would have prevented a conviction. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> {{to show that it}} might have caused a different result.|$|E

25|$|Ultrasonic welding of {{thermoplastics}} causes local melting of {{the plastic}} due to absorption of vibrational energy along the joint to be welded. In metals, welding occurs due to high-pressure dispersion of surface oxides and local motion of the materials. Although there is heating, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to melt the base materials.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some things for which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just {{as if you were}} to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order {{to make sure that the}} single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know that there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Between times 1 to 2 is {{termed the}} {{acquisition}} period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, {{he states that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, {{and nature of the}} acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning or language experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training or language usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says that now that language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).|$|E
25|$|Riot {{shotguns}} {{are also}} more limited in range than combat shotguns {{by the nature of}} their use. A combat shotgun is considered effective out to 75 yards (70 m) because on average at least 1 pellet of a 9 pellet 00 buckshot load will hit a human sized target at that range. This is enough to degrade the combat effectiveness of an enemy soldier, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to reliably disable an assailant in a defensive situation. For that, there must be multiple hits to the target, enough that one or more pellets will hit a vital region. Generally this is well under 27 yards (25 meters) with a cylinder bore barrel. Beyond this range, slugs and good iron sights are recommended, extending the range to over 109 yards (100 meters).|$|E

25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> {{to suggest}} that the novel with its {{multiple}} endings is a mere experiment with the narrative form. [...] "There is something more in it," [...] as Mandal puts it, [...] "an impasse that resists any straight forward resolution to the story." [...] After all, the form of a narrative is determined by its content. It is Sarah Woodruff [...] "the content of whose character produces multiple and contradictory possibilities" [...] for the narrative.|$|E
500|$|The dissent argued that, for {{a section}} 1983 {{claim to be}} valid, [...] "harm alone is not enough; {{it has to be}} the right kind of harm." [...] Thomas {{provided}} an example of a law allowing police to pull over any driver without cause. This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.|$|E

500|$|For artistic pursuits, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> {{to promote}} such things generally, {{as it is}} too vague. A body for {{specific}} artistic purposes may be charitable, as in Royal Choral Society v IRC, as is the promotion of a particular composer, seen in Re Delius. For a gift to be charitable, the courts must be convinced that the subject of advancement be of artistic merit. This includes famous composers, as seen above, and social graces, as in Re Shaw's Wills Trust. When there is doubt, the courts ignore {{the opinions of the}} beneficiary and instead rely on experts, as in Re Pinion. This area is covered by the Charities Act 2006, which lists [...] "the advancement of citizenship or community development" [...] and [...] "the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science" [...] as valid types of charitable trust.|$|E
500|$|Negligence, Cardozo emphasized, {{derives from}} human relations, {{not in the}} abstract. Negligence that does no one harm is not a tort. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough,</b> he found, to prove {{negligence}} by the defendant and damage to the plaintiff; {{there must be a}} breach of duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant. He traced the history of the law of negligence, a concept not known in medieval times, and noted that it evolved as an offshoot of the law of trespass, and one could not sue for trespass to another. Had the railroad been negligent towards Palsgraf, it might have been liable, but [...] "the consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong", and there was no legal wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf. Thus, the lower courts were incorrect, and must be reversed, and the case dismissed, with Palsgraf to bear the costs of suit.|$|E
500|$|Pond's {{article was}} viewed {{by some as}} a {{criticism}} of those in the Prairie School who overemphasized the horizontal over the vertical. [...] In this regard, Pond wrote:"In architectural composition, as in music, order is comprehended in rhythm. [...] Rhythm is expressed in the flow of part into part, of mass into mass, in the appearance and reappearance of certain proportions which are made to exist between the subordinate masses and between these masses and the dominant mass; between all the parts of the perfect whole. [...] Without order there is no architecture; without rhythmic composition no vital architecture can be. [...] That is the highest architecture in which rhythmic action of the structural forces becomes apparent. [...] Vertical forces in action, by the law of gravity, tend to work in right lines; horizontal forces, acted upon by this same law tend to work in curves. ... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> that the rhythmic movement be in horizontal direction only, but there must be a rhythmic flow vertically as well. [...] The result of these combined movements should be that of unity -- simple in its effect though complex in its harmonies." ...|$|E

50|$|The Lakers {{were facing}} elimination, {{and the lack}} of Worthy and Scott <b>was</b> <b>not</b> any help to the Lakers. This would not stop Magic Johnson as Johnson had 20 assists in the game, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough.</b> Elden Campbell outscored Michael Jordan with 13 points in the first half, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough.</b> The Lakers still fought and even led 93-90 in the fourth quarter, but a Bulls 9-0 run, and Paxsons 10 points in the final half of the fourth quarter helped secure the Chicago Bulls, and Michael Jordans, first NBA title.|$|R
500|$|After the result's announcement, President Josipović {{commented that}} the day was of great {{significance}} to Croatia, defining the nation as one with a European future. Prime Minister Milanović welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; {{he also said that}} the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia. Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris Šprem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning. The Croatian Minister of the Economy, Radimir Čačić, concluded that Croatia's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed. He also stated that, since the referendum passed, it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating. Minister of Finance Slavko Linić stated that he was pleased with the result, but not with the voter turnout. He disagreed with Čačić that the credit rating could be saved by this result, since everybody had already counted on Croatian entry to the EU. Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusić {{commented that the}} result was good news for Europe, which faced internal problems. Former Speaker Vladimir Šeks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors– the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions. Luka Bebić, also a former speaker of the Parliament, added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU. Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandroković commented that the result is especially important for the nation's youth, and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesić stated that Croatia should be competitive and use EU funds, adding that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to be happy with entering the EU. He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia, saying that [...] "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".|$|E
