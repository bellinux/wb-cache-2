5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E

25|$|Grief is {{a natural}} {{response}} to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> most people, but individuals grieve {{in connection with a}} variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E
25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> most as {{being used in}} vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E

500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" [...] that {{appeared}} in 1865 was arranged into 21 strophes. It was included with this structure in the fourth edition of Leaves of Grass that was published in 1867. By 1871, Whitman had combined the strophes numbered 19 and 20 into one, and the poem had 20 in total. However, for the seventh edition (1881) of Leaves of Grass, Whitman rearranged the poem's final seven strophes of his original text were combined into the final three strophes of the 16-strophe poem that <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> readers today. For the 1881 edition, the original strophes numbered 14, 15, and 16 were combined into the revised 14th strophe; strophes numbered 17 and 18 were combined into the revised 15th strophe. The material from the former strophes numbered 19, 20 and 21 in 1865 were combined for the revised 16th and final strophe in 1881. According to literary critic and Harvard University professor Helen Vendler, the poem [...] "builds up to its longest and most lyrical moment in canto 14, achieves its moral climax in canto 15, and ends with a coda of 'retrievements out of the night' in canto 16." ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It <b>is</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the [...] "trio") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, [...] "I've got a tune that will knock 'em– will knock 'em flat". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience [...] "rose and yelled ... the one and only {{time in the history of}} the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore." [...] To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, [...] "Land of Hope and Glory", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as [...] "Pomp and Circumstance" [...] or [...] "The Graduation March", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.|$|E
