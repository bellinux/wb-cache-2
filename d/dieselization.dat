5|$|The {{class was}} the {{dominant}} locomotive on NSB's unelectrified lines. It was ordered {{as part of}} the company's <b>dieselization</b> of services during the 1950s and 1960s, and was initially used on the three mainline routes of the Bergen, Dovre and Nordland Lines. In the 1960s the Bergen and Dovre Lines were electrified and the Di 3 units transferred to smaller lines, such as the Meråker, Valdres, Røros, Solør and Rauma Lines. They remained in service with NSB until 2001, five years later than planned due to NSB returning their successor, the Di 6. The units are still in use by the private operator Ofotbanen, the Kosovo Railways, an operator in Sicily, and the Norwegian Railway Museum. The class is similar to the DSB Class MY and MÁV M61.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, NSB {{electrified}} the Sørland Line, {{although the}} final section from Egersund to Stavanger was not converted until 1956. In 1957, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line became the only line to remove the electrification and replace the electric locomotives with diesel power. The 1950s saw the electrification of several regional and commuter lines around Oslo, including the Kongsvinger Line, the Trunk Line and the Dovre Line from Lillestrøm to Hamar, the Vestfold Line and the Eastern Østfold Line. This was largely due to NSB's program to remove all steam locomotives, either by electrification or by <b>dieselization.</b> In the late 1950s and 1960s, several to-be electrified lines were operated with diesel locomotives as an interim solution. The 1960s saw the remaining two steam lines in Southern Norway, the Bergen and Dovre Lines, electrified along with the Gjøvik Line. The Bergen Line was completed in 1964 and the Dovre Line completed in 1970. This finished all the planned electrifications, and the authorities deemed the remaining lines unprofitable to electrify because of low traffic. During the 1990s, a new program was attempted, this time to electrify the entire network, but only the Arendal Line was converted before the program was canceled. However, new lines around Oslo, including the Lieråsen and Oslo Tunnels on the Drammen Line, and the Gardermoen and Asker Lines were electrified {{at the time they}} opened. Further plans have been launched, in particular the section of the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{which is part of the}} Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and the Meråker Line, which connects to the electrified Central Line in Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Only one Yellowstone was retired before <b>dieselization</b> {{took place}} on the Missabe; No. 237 was sold for scrap after a wreck. The rest of the 2-8-8-4s were retired between 1958 and 1963 as diesel {{locomotives}} took over.|$|E
25|$|Despite overall success, the Q2s {{were all}} out of service by 1951. With <b>dieselization,</b> they were the obvious first targets to be {{withdrawn}} since they were {{only a little more}} capable than the conventional J1 class 2-10-4s but with far higher running costs and maintenance loads.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{tractors}} and heavy equipment are mostly diesel-powered. Among tractors, only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline engines. The <b>dieselization</b> of {{tractors and}} heavy equipment began in Germany before World War II but was {{unusual in the}} United States until after that war. During the 1950s and 1960s, it progressed in the US as well.|$|E
25|$|As the 1930s {{drew to a}} close, Baldwin's coal-country {{customers}} such as Pennsylvania Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio, and Norfolk and Western {{were more}} reluctant than other operators to embrace diesel technology, which could undermine the demand for one of their main hauling markets. All three continued to acquire passenger steam locomotives into the early postwar years, as <b>dieselization</b> was gaining momentum elsewhere in the rail industry.|$|E
25|$|The 21 steam {{locomotives}} {{owned by}} the PRSL were from the PRR subsidiary WJ They all consisted of PRR classes. Before <b>dieselization</b> the PRSL was more apt to lease its motive power from either of its parent railroads as it completely lacked any heavy passenger locomotives (like 4-6-2 Pacifics). As its parent railroads began to replace steam with diesel locomotives, the PRSL became a haven for steam locomotives during their final years of operation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1948 the Milwaukee Road re-branded the train Chippewa-Hiawatha and {{upgraded}} its equipment, including Beaver Tail parlor cars. <b>Dieselization</b> followed in 1950. After that the train was downgraded as the Milwaukee Road's passenger service contracted. Service north of Channing ended on December 29, 1953. Parlor service ended north of Milwaukee in 1956. In April 1957 the train's name reverted to the Chippewa. The Milwaukee Road discontinued the train altogether on February 2, 1960.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1920s the Virginian Railway {{had adopted}} an 11 kV 25 Hz AC {{electrification}} for its coal-heavy main line between Mullens, West Virginia and Roanoke, Virginia. To work this line the Virginian bought 36 EL-3A boxcab locomotives from Westinghouse. The Virginian added four EL-2B locomotives from General Electric after World War II, but the original fleet was showing its age. In the mid-1950s the Virginian decided to continue electrification {{in lieu of}} <b>dieselization,</b> and ordered new locomotives from GE to replace the original boxcabs.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{power was}} {{supplied}} through a unique {{system in which}} a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and {{to one side of}} the track. This proved vulnerable to contamination from coal smoke, and after a short time it was replaced by a conventional third rail system. When the Howard Street track was made into a gantlet to allow higher clearances, the pickup contacts on one side were mounted on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when <b>dieselization</b> made it unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Finally in 1937 the B {{bought the}} first {{multiple}} unit diesel locomotives to power its passenger trains. And in 1937 they ran the first {{coast to coast}} use of diesel electric locomotives. The railroad {{put an end to}} the steam locomotive experiments, though wartime pressures would lead to purchase of many other new steam locomotives. <b>Dieselization</b> took many years, and in the meantime a long program of upgrading older locomotives was continued. The P-7 Pacifics were particularly targeted for improvements, culminating in the Cincinnatian, for which four of the engines were upgraded and streamlined to a design by Olive Dennis, who also supervised the refurbishment of the rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|At Camden, the MCSA {{connected}} to an extensive network of private W.T. Carter Company rail lines {{that were used}} to transport freshly cut timber from remote logging camps to the sawmill. Starting in the 1940s, these rail lines were gradually phased out as the lumber company made increasing use of trucks for timber extraction. Since the lumber company owned both rail operations, this process made plenty of surplus W.T. Carter steam locomotives available for use by the MCSA, delaying the onset of <b>dieselization.</b> The MCSA would not obtain its first diesel-electric locomotive until 1960 and still used steam power until 1965, one of the last common-carrier railroads in Texas to do so.|$|E
25|$|John W. Garrett's {{desire to}} have a line to New York led to the {{construction}} of the Baltimore Belt Line in order to bring the railroad across Baltimore. The most important feature of this was the Howard Street Tunnel, which began at Camden Station and headed north to Mount Royal Station. Objections to use of steam led, in 1895, to the first main line electrification in North America. Trains in one direction were pulled through the tunnel, by a series of electric locomotives that lasted until the end of steam; in the other direction, the train simply drifted down the slope. <b>Dieselization</b> made the electrification unnecessary and it was discontinued in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the Milwaukee Road), {{the last}} transcontinental line to be built, {{electrified}} its lines across the Rocky Mountains {{and to the}} Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the Virginian Railway and the Norfolk and Western Railway, electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic {{and the use of}} electric locomotives declined in the face of <b>dieselization.</b> Diesels shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the Black Mesa and Lake Powell), by 2000 electrification was confined to the Northeast Corridor and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesels. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread.|$|E

500|$|As the 1930s dawned, the B's New York {{passenger}} service faced {{two significant}} competitive disadvantages, {{compared to the}} Pennsylvania Railroad. First, the B lacked direct access to Manhattan, resulting in slower overall travel time. Second, the Pennsylvania's move in the early 1930s to replace steam power with modern, smokeless electric service along its entire New YorkWashington mainline was met with enthusiastic public approval. The B responded by introducing Diesel locomotives, air conditioning, and streamlining on its New York trains. On June 24, 1935, the B inaugurated the first lightweight, streamlined train in the eastern U.S., when it began operating a re-christened Royal Blue train between Washington and New York. When the specially modified 4-4-4-type steam locomotive prepared for the run proved less than satisfactory in terms of stability at speed, a new EMC 1800 hp B-B diesel-electric engine with a carbody by General Electric and mechanicals by Electro-Motive Corporation and numbered 50 replaced it, which was yet another first east of the Mississippi River. [...] In 1937 this was replaced with the more demurely streamlined locomotive #51 and booster 51x, among {{the first of the}} new E-Series road Diesel locomotives from General Motors' Electro Motive Company. Previously, early experiments with internal combustion engines to replace steam in railroad applications included short, articulated trainsets (such as Burlington's Pioneer Zephyr and Union Pacific's M-10000), double-head sets of [...] "boxcab" [...] locomotives (developed by EMC) used to power the 1936 version of the AT (Santa Fe) Super Chief (similar to number 50), and the cab/booster unit combinations developed with Union Pacific's M-10002 and M-10003 - M-10006 trainsets. The E units took the most advanced developments of Diesel locomotive technology and made them available to all operators using the consists of their choice, and allowed Number 50 and the aluminum trainset to migrate west to subsidiary Alton, where it operated as the Abraham Lincoln. [...] The earliest adopters of the new E units demonstrated the improved flexibility, efficiency and reduced maintenance costs of Diesel power in daily service compared to steam and gave impetus to the <b>Dieselization</b> of the railroad industry.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, {{passenger}} service remained popular despite <b>dieselization</b> of the MCSA and discontinuation of regular connecting passenger service by the Southern Pacific Railroad at Moscow. [...] After {{the line was}} purchased by Champion International, the new owners became concerned {{about the possibility of}} civil liability {{in the event of an}} accident, especially given the age of the railroad’s 1898 wood combine. Passenger service was finally discontinued in July 1973.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, the DM hauled {{increasing}} tonnage to the ore docks along Lake Superior, {{reaching a}} record of over 49 million tons in 1953. That year the first diesel locomotives, EMD SW9s, arrived on the railway. In 1954, a set of Baldwin DR-4-4-1500 [...] "Sharknose" [...] diesels arrived from the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern (a fellow U.S. Steel railroad), though they were returned to Baldwin Locomotive Works when the EJ contract expired in 1955. <b>Dieselization</b> continued with the purchase of several EMD SD9 road switchers the following year, while the last revenue steam run occurred in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1940s the {{majority}} of American railroads had decided to transition from steam to Diesel power, known as <b>Dieselization.</b> The demand for Diesel-powered passenger service did not grow {{at the same rate}} as for freight service, as air and automobile travel were the burgeoning modes of passenger travel. [...] Nevertheless, the lower profit margins of passenger service made the cost advantages of [...] Diesel over steam all the more critical and steam power was increasingly seen as dirty, smelly, and dated among the travelling public. [...] To meet post-war demands, EMD opened another locomotive production facility in 1948 at Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950s were a time {{of great}} demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater {{capability}} from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive <b>dieselization,</b> from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines, because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis-Chalmers for construction equipment business. The Buda-Lanova models were re-christened the [...] "Allis-Chalmers Diesel" [...] engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating and expanding the line.|$|E
2500|$|Locomotives {{used by the}} Detroit Terminal Railroad in the era {{of steam}} {{locomotives}} were 0-6-0 and 0-8-0 type switch locomotives. Starting in 1945 Detroit Terminal Railroad began replacing its steam locomotives with diesel-electric locomotives. [...] It purchased its first two diesel locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Company in 1945, numbers 101 and 102, both models VO-1000, followed by #103, a DS44-1000 in 1947. [...] It completed <b>dieselization</b> in 1947 with the purchase of nine model NW2 diesel switchers from Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, numbers 104 through 112. [...] It purchased two more NW2 model switchers in 1949 (numbers 114 and 115) and purchased its final locomotive in 1951 with an EMD SW7 model switcher, number 116.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the Chippewas {{equipment}} came second-hand {{from its}} more famous cousin. The original Chippewa operated with two coaches, a {{railway post office}} (RPO), dining car, and parlor car. As part of a reshuffling of equipment on the Milwaukee Road in late 1948 the Chippewa received the [...] "Beaver Tail" [...] parlors made famous by the original Hiawatha. Motive power was provided by Class A 4-4-2 steam locomotives between Chicago and Milwaukee, and by the Class F3 Pacifics north. <b>Dieselization</b> came in 1950 with Erie-builts from Fairbanks-Morse. Later diesels included EMD E7s, EMD FP7s, and finally EMD GP9s. The train received newer equipment in 1948, including third-generation Beaver Tail parlors. These cars were removed in 1951 along with the full dining car.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of the new custom streamliners, EMC {{invested}} in a new locomotive factory and started development work on the locomotives that it would produce. The new headquarters on 55th Street in McCook, Illinois, west of Chicago, remains the corporate headquarters. The 1935 EMC 1800 hp B-B boxcab development design locomotives featured the multiple-unit control systems that became the basis of cab/booster locomotive sets, and the twin 900hp Winton Diesel engine power unit format that would be adopted for the Budd-built Zephyr power units in 1936 and EMC's E series streamlined passenger locomotives that the new factory began producing in 1937. [...] Prior to their introduction of the E units EMC was in production of switch engines, which remained the mainstay of their production until <b>Dieselization</b> of freight and passenger service hit full stride in the mid-1940s.|$|E
2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. <b>Dieselization</b> with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-6-0 Mogul #92 {{was built}} by the Canadian Locomotive Company of Kingston, Ontario in 1910 for the Grand Trunk Railroad (Soon to be owned by Canadian National Railway). The engine was {{classified}} as an E-8-a, but was reclassified as an E-12 and again to an E-10-a after being upgraded with Piston Valves and Superheating. The engine was renumbered to 919 in the 1920's and operated under that number until the Mid 1950's when it {{and the rest of}} the E-10-a class were renumbered from 81-96, where it gained the number 92. 92 and most of the E-10-a class worked branch lines across the system. The engine was taken out of service in the late 1950's during the railroad's transition period to <b>dieselization</b> and was listed as surplus. In 1960 the locomotive was purchased by Thomas C. Marshall Jr. in 1960 for it to run on the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc.'s future railroad. It was moved down to Yorklyn, Delaware where it was rebuilt. It was the first steam locomotive to operate for the railroad when it became a tourist line. The engine operated from Spring of 1966 to Fall of 1972, when the engine was taken out of service due to mechanical issues. The engine is stored in Marshallton, awaiting restoration to operation.|$|E
2500|$|ALCO-GE was EMD's {{most serious}} {{competitor}} during the <b>Dieselization</b> era, having produced the first road-switcher Diesel locomotives in 1941 and gained about a 40% {{market share of}} Diesel locomotives, mostly for switching and short-haul applications, as of 1948. [...] ALCO's attempts to develop higher powered locomotives for mainline service had been less successful, as they were plagued by reliability problems. [...] In 1948 the ALCO-GE partnership developed a prototype gas-turbine-electric locomotive; customer delivery began in 1952. [...] Baldwin's early ventures into road Diesel production, while innovative, borrowed ill-suited design and production concepts from steam and electric locomotives, and were not sufficiently reliable to gain acceptance. [...] Baldwin's postwar steam turbine-electric locomotives were spectacularly unsuccessful. [...] Fairbanks-Morse entered the locomotive industry {{at the end of}} the war by partnering with General Electric to produce [...] "Erie-built" [...] locomotives using F-M's opposed-piston engine that they had developed for marine use. [...] In early 1949 GE ended the partnership, undermining F-M's tentative foothold in the industry. Facing desperation as the market for steam power collapsed, Lima-Hamilton produced a total of 174 Diesel locomotives of various models starting in 1949 but it was too little too late to make the company a serious player in the Diesel business. [...] By 1950 it was clear that EMD's competitors could not crack their position in mainline road Diesels and their introduction of the EMD GP7 road switcher locomotive in 1949 marked their arrival in the mainstay of ALCO's business.|$|E
2500|$|... 4449 was {{the last}} engine {{manufactured}} in Southern Pacific's first order of GS-4 (Golden State/General Service) locomotives. 4449 was placed into service on May 30, 1941, and spent its early career assigned to the Coast Daylight, SP's premier passenger train between San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, but it also pulled many other of the SP's named passenger trains. After the arrival of newer GS-4s and GS-5s, 4449 was assigned to Golden State Route and Sunset Route passenger trains. 4449 was reassigned to the Coast Division in the early 1950s. One of 4449's career highlights happened on October 17, 1954, when 4449 and sister 4447 pulled a special 10-car train for the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society from Los Angeles to Owenyo, California, and return. In 1955, after {{being one of the}} last few Daylight steam engines in Daylight livery, 4449 was painted black and silver and its side skirting (a streamlining feature of the Daylight steam engines) was removed due to <b>dieselization</b> of the Coast Daylight in January of that year. 4449 was then assigned to Southern Pacific's San Joaquin Valley line, occasionally pulling passenger trains such as the San Joaquin Daylight between Oakland and Bakersfield as well as fast freight and helper service. 4449 was semi-retired from service on September 24, 1956, and was kept as an emergency back-up locomotive until it was officially retired on October 2, 1957, and was placed in storage along with several other GS-class engines near Southern Pacific's Bakersfield roundhouse.|$|E
2500|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} {{appeared on the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1925 and on the New York Central in 1927. Since then, {{diesel locomotive}}s {{began to appear in}} mainline service in the United States in the mid-1930s. The diesel engines reduced maintenance costs dramatically, while increasing locomotive availability. On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over [...] a year, compared with about [...] for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed dieselisation in the US. In 1949 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad became the first large mainline railroad to convert completely to diesel locomotives, and Life Magazine ran an article on 5 December 1949 titled [...] "The GM puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major US railroad to dieselize 100%". The Susquehanna was one of the earliest railroads in America to fully dieselize by 1947 and retiring their steam locomotives by 1949. The final 2-8-4 Berkshire built in the world was Nickle Plate Road's 779 built in 1949. [...] The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. In Spring of 1960, Norfolk and Western Y6b 2190 and S1 290 doused their fires for the last time in a Williamson, West Virginia roundhouse. The Age of Steam was over that ended steam locomotive common carrier service in the United States. 1960 is normally considered the final year of regular Class 1 main line standard gauge steam operation in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in Maine. Union Pacific did not retire their final steam locomotives however, until 1963 and 1964 respectively. Within the 10 year period between 1960 and 1970, 47,000 common carrier steam locomotives were replaced by over 30,000 more modern, sleek-looking diesels.
