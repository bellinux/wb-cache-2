5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E

5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
30|$|Wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L^ 2 (R^d) {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} by many authors [1 – 8]. In particular, homogeneous wavelet dual <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L^ 2 (R^d) were first characterized by Han [9], and then studied by Bownik [3]. For homogeneous wavelet dual frames, regularity and vanishing moments have been both required. However, for nonhomogeneous wavelet dual <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> Sobolev space pairs (H^s(R^d), H^-s(R^d)), they can be separated. It {{makes it easy to}} construct dual frames (see [10 – 14] for details).

5|$|The Great Seal: The Great Seal of Fordham University was {{designed}} to acknowledge {{the presence of the}} Society of Jesus on campus, hence the order's coat of arms in the seal's center. The coat of arms bears the Greek letters of the lapidary form of Jesus Christ (IHS), with the Cross resting on the center of the H and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the epigraph. These figures, dressed in gold, lay in a field <b>framed</b> <b>in</b> maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown, enclosing the university's pedagogical disciplines: arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law. Below the shield is a blue scroll with the university's motto, Sapientia et Doctrina. The scroll rests on a gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina) and is surrounded by the fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of wisdom (sapientia). In a circular maroon field embroidered with beads is Fordham's official title, Universitas Fordhamensis; at the field's lower edge is the date of the university's founding, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal is a heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, however, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, some {{researchers}} propose {{the concept of}} orthogonal wavelet frames, which are useful for multiple access communication systems. In this article, we first give two explicit algorithms for constructing paraunitary symmetric matrices (p. s. m. for short), whose entries are symmetric or antisymmetric Laurent polynomials. We also give two algorithms for constructing orthogonal wavelet frames from existing tight or dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs). The constructed orthogonal wavelet frames are also tight or dual ones. Furthermore, based on the constructed p. s. m. and the existing symmetric tight (dual) wavelet frames, we can obtain symmetric orthogonal (s. o. for short) tight (dual) wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs). From the constructed s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs), we can obtain s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rm) by the projection method, where m≤s. To illustrate our results, we construct s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (R) and L 2 (R 2) from the quadratic B-spline B 3 (x). Especially, in Example 2, we obtain nonseparable tight 2 I 2 -wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (R 2) from a separable tight 2 I 2 -wavelet frame constructed by tensor product...|$|R
