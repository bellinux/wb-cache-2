5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to <b>DC</b> <b>voltage</b> output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

3000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the {{reference}} d-current component i_d^ref of the GSC should choose the minimum value between the current command of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation and √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2), as shown in Fig.  2. Considering the engineering operability in the electrical data collection process, however, the value of i_d^ref is always set as √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2) in the Eq. (3). As a result, if {{the right side of the}} Eq. (3) is not lower than 0, the GSC still fails to meet the adjusted requirement of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation, even though the value of the reference d-current component i_d^ref has been set as its current limit. Therefore the <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will rise. If the right side of the Eq. (3) is lower than 0, the <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will fluctuate near the normal value since the GSC can meet the adjusted requirement of the PI controller for <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> regulation. In this paper, when the <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> rises or fluctuates, it can be distinguished based on the relationship between the post-fault <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> and the normal value, e.g., if the post-fault <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> calculated based on Eq. (3) is lower than the normal value, it means the <b>DC</b> link <b>voltage</b> will fluctuate near the normal value, otherwise it will rise.|$|R

When DFIG is operating near to the synchronous speed, the required value of the virtual <b>dc</b> link <b>voltage</b> is null or the least minimum. With the variation of the wind speed with respect to time which results in the deviation of DFIG operation from synchronous speed, the required virtual <b>dc</b> link <b>voltage</b> changes as shown in Figure  11.|$|R
50|$|With line commutated {{converter}}s, {{the converter}} {{has only one}} degree of freedom - the firing angle, which represents the time delay between the voltage across a valve becoming positive (at which point the valve would start to conduct if it were made from diodes) and the thyristors being turned on. The <b>DC</b> output <b>voltage</b> of the converter steadily becomes less positive as the firing angle is increased: firing angles of up to 90° correspond to rectification and result in positive <b>DC</b> <b>voltages,</b> while firing angles above 90° correspond to inversion and result in negative <b>DC</b> <b>voltages.</b> The practical upper limit for the firing angle is about 150-160° because above this, the valve would have insufficient turn-off time.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a new concept in selecting the values of the <b>DC</b> source <b>voltages</b> in cascaded multi-level inverters in order to improve the output voltage THD. Design/methodology/approach: In cascaded multi-level inverters, it is usually assumed that the DC sources have the same constant voltage and output harmonics minimization is accomplished by applying proper switching angles. Employing different <b>DC</b> <b>voltages</b> with proper ratios can result in further reduction of the harmonics. After formulation of the system, i. e. describing the inverter's output voltage components in terms of the switching angles and unequal <b>DC</b> source <b>voltages,</b> a rule is applied to obtain the step heights of the staircase output waveform (<b>DC</b> source <b>voltages),</b> so that the output waveform becomes as close to the required fundamental sine wave as possible. Substituting the obtained <b>DC</b> source <b>voltages</b> into the harmonics elimination equations results in a set of equations, which are functions of switching angles only. Solving these equations leads to proper switching angles, which, regardless of the fundamental component's value, provide the specified harmonic conditions. The output voltage is then controlled by <b>DC</b> sources <b>voltage</b> regulation. Findings: Computer simulations show that employing the proposed concept results in substantial improvement in the harmonic minimization, as well as, extending the operating range of the inverter, compared to the conventional methods with equal <b>DC</b> source <b>voltage</b> multi-level inverters.
