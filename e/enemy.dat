5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an <b>enemy</b> with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the <b>enemy</b> by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each <b>enemy</b> possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the <b>enemy</b> up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the <b>enemy</b> to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>enemy</b> has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the <b>enemy</b> is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} <b>enemy.</b> When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each <b>enemy,</b> the <b>enemy</b> becomes Staggered. In this mode, the <b>enemy</b> has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an <b>enemy</b> sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an <b>enemy</b> shoot between them.|$|E

5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the <b>enemy</b> officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many <b>enemy</b> officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to <b>enemy</b> morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the <b>enemy</b> to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the <b>enemy</b> units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an <b>enemy,</b> a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the <b>enemy</b> type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an <b>enemy,</b> or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the <b>enemy</b> strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block <b>enemy</b> attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each <b>enemy</b> has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the <b>enemy,</b> their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the <b>enemy</b> is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E

5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering <b>enemy.</b> Legend has it that Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the <b>enemy</b> troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five <b>enemy</b> kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from <b>enemy</b> soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from <b>enemy</b> soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from <b>enemy</b> divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind <b>enemy</b> divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the <b>enemy,</b> and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 18 April 1945, he led his company through the shell-battered, sniper-infested {{wreckage}} of Nuremberg, Germany. When blistering machinegun fire caught his unit in an exposed position, he ordered his men to take cover, dashed forward alone, and, as bullets whined about him, shot the 3-man guncrew with his carbine. Continuing the advance at the head of his company, he located an <b>enemy</b> patrol armed with rocket launchers which threatened friendly armor. He again went forward alone, secured a vantage point and opened fire on the Germans. Immediately he became the target for concentrated machine pistol and rocket fire, which blasted the rubble about him. Calmly, he continued to shoot at the patrol until he had killed all 6 <b>enemy</b> infantrymen. Continuing boldly far in front of his company, he entered a park, where as his men advanced, a German machinegun opened up on them without warning. With his carbine, he killed the gunner; and then, from a completely exposed position, he directed machinegun fire on the remainder of the crew until all were dead. In a final duel, he wiped out a third machinegun emplacement with rifle fire at a range of 10 yards. By fearlessly engaging in 4 single-handed fire fights with a desperate, powerfully armed <b>enemy,</b> Lt. DALY, voluntarily taking all major risks himself and protecting his men at every opportunity, killed 15 Germans, silenced 3 <b>enemy</b> machineguns and wiped out an entire <b>enemy</b> patrol. His heroism during the lone bitter struggle with fanatical <b>enemy</b> forces was an inspiration to the valiant Americans who took Nuremberg.|$|E
50|$|The ship's {{attacks that}} target {{airborne}} <b>enemies</b> gradually increase in strength {{as the ship}} evolves, but the attacks against <b>enemies</b> on the ground cannot be improved in the same way.

The ship's attacks against <b>enemies</b> on the ground increase in strength during this period. However, some ground <b>enemies</b> cannot be killed during this power-up. No further power-ups exist for attacks against <b>enemies</b> on the ground. The giant version of Zanzō cannot be knocked out, so the player cannot use it to improve their ground attack.|$|R

5|$|In the legion, the velites were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii.

After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the <b>enemy.</b> They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the <b>enemy,</b> they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack.|$|E
5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on <b>enemy</b> activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the <b>enemy.</b> SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy <b>enemy</b> installations and disrupt or kill <b>enemy</b> forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E
