5|$|The {{number and}} identities of {{metalloids}} {{depend on what}} classification criteria are used. Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the <b>ill-defined</b> margins.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of trial by peers was still <b>ill-defined,</b> and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be <b>ill-defined</b> without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Early on October 25, Hurricane Fox {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean. It crossed central Andros and turned east across the Bahamas. On October 26, the {{hurricane}} briefly re-intensified as it crossed Cat Island. The center became <b>ill-defined,</b> and the cyclone quickly weakened. It turned north {{and then took}} an erratic northeast turn as it weakened to a tropical storm on October 27. The system gained extratropical characteristics as it merged with a polar frontal boundary, and it dissipated west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and <b>ill-defined.</b> Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E
5|$|One current {{difficulty}} in {{the ideas of}} Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are <b>ill-defined.</b> One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, {{a series of tests}} that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} pairs of cranial nerves emerge {{directly}} from the brainstem. The brainstem also contains nuclei of many cranial and peripheral nerves, as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing, control of eye movements and balance. The reticular formation, a network of nuclei of <b>ill-defined</b> formation, is present within and {{along the length of}} the brainstem. Many nerve tracts, which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body, pass through the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|When Spin Alternative Record Guide {{was first}} published, {{it did not}} sell {{particularly}} well and received a mixed reaction from reviewers. The quality and relevance of the contributors' writing were praised, while the editors' concept and comprehensiveness of alternative music were seen as <b>ill-defined.</b> Nonetheless, it inspired a number of future music critics and helped revive the career of 1960s folk artist John Fahey, whose entry in the book helped renew interest in his music {{at the time of}} its publication.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and <b>ill-defined.</b> However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June23. It reached the eastern Pacific on July3, where associated convection began to increase three days later. Continued slow development occurred thereafter, and following satellite trends, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four-E at 1800UTC on July9. Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters too cool to support a tropical cyclone and into an environment of moderate shear. The low-level circulation became <b>ill-defined</b> and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The low continued northwest until dissipation at 0000UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an <b>ill-defined</b> low-level center. Later, satellite observations {{indicated that the}} storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, <b>ill-defined</b> and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E
5|$|Early on July 23, {{the storm}} briefly became disorganized, with the {{low-level}} circulation becoming <b>ill-defined.</b> Around the same time, Emilia passed about 175mi (280km) southwest of Manzanillo, which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; {{it is believed}} to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form. Operationally, it was estimated to have reached winds of 70mph (115km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the NHC later re-assessed Emilia as reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h), since the eye feature was temporary and not well-defined.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, {{as during}} the Principate, these forces were {{organised}} into <b>ill-defined</b> units based on a single ethnic group called numeri ("troops", although numerus was also {{the name of a}} regular infantry unit). They served alongside the regular army for the duration of particular campaigns or for a specified period. Normally their service would be limited to the region where the tribe lived, but sometimes could be deployed elsewhere. They were commanded by their own leaders. It is unclear whether they used their own weapons and armour or the standard equipment of the Roman army. In the late army, the more useful and long-serving numeri appear to have been absorbed into the regular late army, rapidly becoming indistinguishable from other units.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} was {{forecast}} to dissipate quickly over land, although the possibility was noted for a westward turn, due to an anticyclone located over central Mexico. About 10hours after moving ashore, Norman weakened to tropical depression status, and while moving further inland its track turned to the northwest. The center became very <b>ill-defined</b> over the mountainous terrain of southwest Mexico, although stronger rainbands persisted offshore. Late on September21, the poorly defined center of Norman emerged into open waters near Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, and subsequently turned northward. At first, the depression was forecast to re-intensify into a minimal tropical storm; however, its previous land interaction prevented it from ever re-strengthening. The circulation remained close to the coastline, and at 1500UTC on September22, Norman made landfall near Mazatlán, Sinaloa, as a weak tropical depression. Within a few hours, the cyclone dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite {{a slight increase}} in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to take its toll on the increasingly <b>ill-defined</b> storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began {{to take a more}} northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an <b>ill-defined</b> center. By September24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} initially tracked slowly north-northwestward {{and gradually}} strengthened. Late on September 1 it intensified into Tropical Storm Isis while located about 200miles (320km) south of Cabo San Lucas. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the deep convection was not organized, causing one forecaster to describe Isis {{as a large}} monsoon-like system. A mid-level trough extending southward from the Arizona/California border caused the storm to accelerate northward. The storm quickly strengthened; six hours after Isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70mph (115km/h). Very deep, symmetrical convection developed over the poorly defined center of circulation while banding features began to form, although <b>ill-defined</b> outflow and land interaction with the Baja California Peninsula initially prevented further strengthening. At 1200UTC on September 2, Isis made landfall on extreme southeastern Baja California Sur as a strong tropical storm, and subsequently turned to the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained <b>ill-defined</b> due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Matthew {{combined with a}} broad {{area of low pressure}} over the northwestern Caribbean to form Tropical Storm Nicole by 12:00UTC on September28, about 75mi (120km) south of the Isle of Youth, Cuba. Affected by strong westerly shear, Nicole never inherited a traditional appearance on satellite imagery; instead, it was characterized by an <b>ill-defined</b> circulation west of most convection, with the strongest winds well displaced from the center. The cyclone attained peak winds of 45mph (75km/h) shortly after formation, but its center of circulation became increasingly diffuse as Nicole tracked toward the Cuba coastline, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 15:00UTC on September29. The low moved north-northeast into the Bahamas, where it became extratropical and quickly weakened to a trough on September30.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, <b>ill-defined</b> American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Felice was {{a modest}} {{tropical}} cyclone that lightly affected {{parts of the}} Gulf Coast of the United States in mid-September 1970. Spawned by an upper-level trough over the Bahamas, the system crossed the Florida Keys and entered the Gulf of Mexico, where it gradually began to strengthen. Felice was a disorganized storm for its entire duration, plagued by dry air, a lack of deep thunderstorm activity, and an <b>ill-defined</b> center of circulation, but nevertheless managed to peak as a high-end tropical storm with winds just below Category 1 hurricane strength. Tracking northwestward, the storm brushed southern Louisiana on September 15 before making landfall northeast of Galveston, Texas, late that same day. Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States. While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ivan {{gradually}} became better organized as wind shear decreased, and its outflow expanded in all quadrants. Satellite imagery late on September 3 depicted a well-defined curved band wrapping around {{much of the}} circulation. The next day, the deep convection temporarily became <b>ill-defined,</b> before reorganizing and developing an eye feature. Convection strengthened further as the feature transitioned into an eye, and Ivan became a hurricane at around 0600UTC on September 5. After reaching hurricane status, Ivan began to rapidly intensify with continued favorable conditions, and in an 18‑hour period the pressure dropped 39mbar (1.15inHg) as the winds increased by 60mph (95km/h); early on September 6 Ivan attained an initial peak intensity of 135mph (215km/h) while located about 825miles (1330km) east of the island of Tobago in the southern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|When Alpha {{came within}} the Doppler weather radar range of Puerto Rico, the radar {{suggested}} that an eyewall-like feature had developed. Alpha was tracking along the southwest {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge. With nearby Hurricane Wilma's large circulation, Alpha was experiencing strong southerly flow from Wilma. Alpha, with its small circulation, was then faced with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, which led forecasters to believe Alpha was soon to dissipate. Shortly after Alpha reached its peak intensity on October23 its wind decreased. While convection remained in bands, the low level circulation was disrupted by land. This left the center <b>ill-defined</b> and difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|While {{crossing}} eastern Cuba, {{the circulation}} of Arlene became <b>ill-defined,</b> although re-strengthening over water was considered possible. When it reached open waters, Arlene was already a depression, and there was considered little likelihood of redevelopment, with strong shear pushing the convection far east of the center. Nevertheless, a NOAA reconnaissance mission found that winds briefly increased to 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm strength, located over the southeastern Bahamas in a large convective band extending of the center. When the thunderstorms dissipated, the winds again dropped, and Arlene returned to tropical depression status. Early on May9, the depression was absorbed by an advancing trough. Late the next day, the combined systems reorganized and resembled having some subtropical characteristics, although it weakened further by May11.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became <b>ill-defined</b> and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E
5|$|An <b>ill-defined</b> {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} eastern Pacific on August1 and steadily organized to attain tropical depression intensity eight days later. Within {{an environment of}} light shear, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie at 0000UTC on August9 and continued to organize to attain Category1 hurricane intensity by 1200UTC the following day as an eye became apparent on satellite. Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949mb (hPa; 28.03inHg) at 0000UTC on September12, while positioned roughly 980mi (1575km) east-southeast of the Big Island. Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter; at 1200UTC on September14, the system weakened to a Category2 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on September15, the cyclone was barely a Category1 hurricane. Six hours later, it weakened to a tropical storm as the low-level center became exposed on satellite. Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September16 and dissipated by 1800UTC.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its <b>ill-defined</b> organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by Météo-France. Shortly after, wind shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly <b>ill-defined</b> on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Felicia {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on July23, 2009. A weak system, the wave was barely identifiable as it tracked westward. By July26, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea before crossing Central America and entering the eastern Pacific basin on July29. The system remained <b>ill-defined</b> until August1, at which time convection began to increase and the wave showed signs of organization. The storm gradually became better organized as it tracked generally towards the west. By August3, the system became increasingly organized and around 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Eight-E. Convective banding features and poleward outflow were being enhanced by the nearby Tropical Storm Enrique. The main steering component of the depression was an upper-level low located to the north, causing the depression to track generally west before turning northwest after the low weakened.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with high wind shear, marginal ocean temperatures caused deep convection {{in association with}} Flossie to weaken and become ragged; as a result, the forecast called for continued weakening. Instead, a brief reprieve in upper-level winds allowed the system to intensify to a secondary peak of 65mph (100km/h) by 1200UTC on July28. An anticyclone northwest of the system increased shear atop the system once again by the following day, and dry air began to become ingested into the circulation. The low-level vortex became exposed to view and progressively <b>ill-defined</b> as outflow boundaries in association with a previous convective burst impeded on the low. At 0000UTC on July30, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression; after the circulation became indistinguishable on satellite imagery twelve hours later, the system was declared a remnant area of low pressure. At this time, the vortex was centered near the northern coast of Kauai.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes <b>ill-defined,</b> with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities must exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an <b>ill-defined</b> circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E
5|$|In the {{overnight}} hours after formation, {{the storm was}} disorganized with a ragged and <b>ill-defined</b> center of circulation. Located {{to the south of}} a mid to upper-level ridge over the southern United States, the system tracked to the west-northwest through an environment conducive for further strengthening; an upper-level anticyclone developed over the central Gulf of Mexico, and sea surface temperatures along its track were warm. The cloud pattern became better organized, maintaining a large area of convection with curved rainbands and well-established outflow. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Erin at 1530UTC on August 15 about 250miles (400km) east of Brownsville, Texas. As it continued northwestward, Erin remained disorganized and failed to strengthen beyond minimal tropical storm status. At 1200UTC on August 16 the cyclone made landfall near Lamar, Texas as it weakened to tropical depression status. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center ceased issuing advisories on Erin as warning responsibility was transferred to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.|$|E
5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde observations from various nations {{for two days}} before being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting observations from Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became <b>ill-defined.</b> By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an <b>ill-defined</b> super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E
