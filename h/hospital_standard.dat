40|$|Abstract Michigan's Department of Community Health (MDCH) is {{responsible}} for managing hospitals through the utilization of a Certificate of Need (CON) Commission. Regulation is achieved by {{limiting the number of}} beds a hospital can use for inpatient services. MDCH assigns hospitals to service areas and sub areas by use patterns. Hospital beds are then assigned within these Hospital Service Areas and Facility Sub Areas. The determination of the number of hospital beds a facility subarea is authorized to hold, called bed need, is defined in the Michigan <b>Hospital</b> <b>Standards</b> and published by the CON Commission and MDCH. These standards vaguely define a methodology for calculating hospital bed need for a projection year, five years ahead of the base year (defined as the most recent year for which patient data have been published by the Michigan Hospital Association). MDCH approached the authors and requested a reformulation of the process. Here we present a comprehensive guide and associated code as interpreted from the <b>hospital</b> <b>standards</b> with results from the 2011 projection year. Additionally, we discuss methodologies for other states and compare them to Michigan's Bed Need methodology. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic {{kidney disease}} causes {{progressive}} deterioration of kidney function and is commonly irreversible, leading to nausea and vomiting {{as a consequence}} of high ureum and creatinine in the blood. This condition results in declining appetite which greatly affects food intake and degrading nutritional status that causes high mortality among chronic kidney patients. Therefore efforts are made on how to increase intake of chronic kidney patients. Objective: To identify the effect of nutrition therapy through commercial diet modification to nutrition intake and status of pre-hemodialysis chronic kidney patients at DR. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang. Method: The study was a quasi experiment which used pre-test and post-test with control group design. Population of the study were all patients of pre-hemodialysis chronic kidney disease hospitalized at DR. M. Djamil Hospital of Padang. Samples were patients of pre-hemodialysis chronic kidney disease at internal medicine ward. The experiment group consisted of 11 patients who got modified diet within 6 days and control group consisted of 11 patients who got <b>hospital</b> <b>standard</b> diet with α = 0. 05 and ß = 10 %. The study were collected from January-March 2008. Data of intake were analyzed using Nutri Survey program. Statistical t-test and chi-square were used to identify the effect of commercial modified diet to food intake, nutritional status, and increase of ureum and creatinine. Absorption level was measured from the quantity of commercial nutrition used. Perception of the patients about commercial diet was obtained through questionnaires and analyzed to get the score. Results: The group with modified diet had better energy and protein intake than the group with <b>hospital</b> <b>standard</b> diet (p < 0. 05). However, {{there was no significant difference}} in nutritional status, ureum and creatinine changes between patients who got modified diet and those who got <b>hospital</b> <b>standard</b> diet (p < 0. 05). The result of analysis on perception of patients about commercial diet showed that patients could accept commercial diet. Conclusion: Commercial modified diet could increase intake of energy and protein of pre-hemodialysis chronic kidney patients...|$|E

Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of soy protein supplement and <b>hospital</b> <b>standard</b> supplement (animal protein) on anthropometries and laboratory findings in malnutrition patients during hospitalization. Method: Forty-eight patients with malnutrition (confirmed by Body Mass Index < 20 kg/m 2) aged 14 - 70 years old were recruited from Internal Medicine wards in Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. The study design was randomized controlled trial. The subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups were fed supplement diet contained soy protein supplement diet (40 g/d) or <b>hospital</b> <b>standard</b> supplement (40 g/d) for 2 weeks. Body weight was measured in the first day (base line data), 7 -dayand 14 -day after intervention. Blood and urine was collected at baseline, 7 -day and 14 -day for measuring transferin, prealbumin and nitrogen balance. The intake of supplement, gastrointestinal symptoms and others adverse event were noted every day. Result: From 48 subjects, there were only 32 patients that completed the study during 2 weeks. In the base line data there were no significant different for intake diet calculation, anthropometrics and laboratory parameters in study group and control group. A total of patients 32 consist of 20 (62, 5 %) female and 12 (37, 5 %) male with a mean age 31, 8 + 12, 9 years old. Anthropometrics evaluation after 1 week and 2 weeks intervention in soy protein supplement showed significantly increased every week in 2 weeks. In control group, significantly increased showed only after two weeks intervention. But there was no significantly increased of BMI of two groups. Serum transferin concentration increased from 1, 489 ± 0, 502 at base line to be 1, 600 ± 0, 502 at week 1 and to bel, 695 ± 0, 402 in study group.
