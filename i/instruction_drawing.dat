40|$|Abstract: Skills {{in reading}} (and {{learning}} information from) texts written in English {{as a foreign}} language (EFL reading) constitute {{an important element of}} the establishment of English curriculum of secondary and tertiary schools (both English and non-English departments) in Indonesia. The need of the learners to be skilled in reading to learn has inspired EFL reading teachers or specialists to apply some techniques in the teaching of EFL reading and to investigate the effects of the techniques on improving Indonesian studentsâ€™ reading skills, as well as to examine various related aspects such as reading materials, reading strategies, and factors affecting reading comprehension. Our purpose in writing this article is to review recent development in the EFL reading pedagogy and research in Indonesia and to view it from the broader perspective on the theories of reading processÂ and ESL/EFL reading <b>instruction.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the results of this analysis, we will outline the current trends and recommend future direction in the EFL reading pedagogy and research in this country...|$|E
30|$|The {{researchers}} {{in this study}} hypothesized that mathematics coaches and teachers could advance mathematics instruction and problem solving through targeted collaborative opportunities to envision MEAs {{as a vehicle for}} STEM integration. MEAs encourage students to iteratively design, develop, and construct mathematical models to solve a problem posed by a client or organization (Lesh et al. 2000). These structures have the potential to support coaches and teachers as they initially envision the contextual affordances of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary STEM within the boundaries of daily mathematics <b>instruction.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from Stohlmann’s (2013) definition of STEM integration as “an effort for mathematics teachers to use the engineering design process as the structure for students to learn mathematical content along with science concepts through technology-infused activities,” the researchers strategized a flexible and fluid professional development that would (1) place participants’ varied knowledge and experiences on the STEM curriculum integration continuum (Vasquez et al. 2013); (2) elicit a narrower implementation aligned with teacher knowledge and beliefs using MEAs (Lesh et al. 2000; Maiorca and Stohlmann 2014); and (3) focus on making the mathematics content explicit.|$|E
40|$|In Sweden students’ {{encounters}} with English {{in and out}} of school are very different. Spending around 20 hours per week in English-mediated environments outside of school, they are often engaged in richly meaningful activities. Consequently, many young people believe they learn as much of their English as a result of participation in English-mediated leisure time activities as they do from textbook-dominated classroom <b>instruction.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on emerging discussions on the ways in which learners’ beliefs about the primacy of learning English in natural environments can have negative effects on learning behaviours in formal settings (e. g. Mercer & Ryan, 2010), and how learners’ beliefs about the causes of success in language learning can impact on motivation (e. g. Hsieh, 2012), this chapter examines the ways in which such beliefs may impact on Swedish students’ responses to classroom learning. Further, {{in view of the fact}} that beliefs about the context in which English is mostly acquired differ substantially between girls and boys, the chapter examines the ways in which gender differences in the nature of self-regulation can impact on students’ beliefs...|$|E

40|$|A key {{challenge}} in shaping science learning {{for the future}} will be to develop new measures of learning that take into account {{what it means to be}} proficient in science (Pellegrino, 2013). The emergent view on proficiency, grounded in learning sciences research, emphasises using and applying knowledge in the context of disciplinary practice. Referred to as knowledge-in-use, this perspective on science proficiency is a centrepiece of the United States’ National Research Council’s (NRC) Framework for K– 12 Science Education (NRC, 2012), embodied in the new US national standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013) and emphasised in the recently released NRC report on developing assessments to measure science proficiency (Pellegrino, Wilson, Koenig 2 ̆ 6 Beatty, 2014). Central to this view is that disciplinary content — both disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts — and practice should be integrated. This would mean that as students apply knowledge to make sense of phenomena and solve problems, they deepen their conceptual understanding of content as well as their understanding of how to do science. This paper provides a brief overview of a systematic and scalable approach for designing assessment items to measure student proficiency with new science learning goals that blend disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts with practices. The assessment tasks are intended for formative use within classroom <b>instruction.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on prior research from assessment and curriculum design (for example, see DeBarger, Krajcik 2 ̆ 6 Harris, 2014; DeBarger, Penuel 2 ̆ 6 Harris, 2015), this paper presents such a design approach and considers implications of the overall work in this field...|$|E

40|$|When {{confronted with}} {{algebraic}} expressions, many see {{little more than}} a random combination of letters, numbers, and other signs. However, others easily approach the algebraic structures formed by the symbols; they manipulate expressions, evaluate them, get solutions. They have algebraic structure sense. This work investigates the processes of the development of algebraic structure sense in classroom <b>instruction,</b> <b>drawing</b> on data from two teaching units (one on linear equations, one on linear funtions) that were planned in cooperation with the mathematics teacher of the class. Two networked theoretical views - the GCSt model by Bikner-Ahsbahs and the Theory of Objectification by Radford - allow for the identification and interpretative description of situations in which students see structures and under the right circumstances develop algebraic structure sense. Using the documentary method, the long-term observations of classroom action are first understood in their complexity and then analyzed for their meaning with regard to the research questions. As a result, the development of algebraic structure sense can be described as a process of becoming familiar with the activity connected to the respective algebraic structure. With regard to linear equations a detailed pathway for this process is laid out. It is shown how the new view on the algebraic structure manifests itself in verbal descriptions and inscriptions. Furthermore, the role of prior knowledge is discussed. However, the development of algebraic structure sense is not a purely mental achievement: Situational interest and established roles influence the learning process. A social form of interaction is described that integrates all these aspects: Students tune their views on the algebraic structure with that of the teacher. In the closing discussion the empirical results are bound to the theories that were used. Furthermore, connections are made to the wider research landscape and it is shown how the results from this work are of relevance beyond its concrete topic...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this special issue is {{instructed}} second language acquisition (ISLA). It is to explore {{some of the most}} recent developments in this area of SLA research and its implications for classroom <b>instruction.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on some current definitions (Leow, 2015; Loewen, 2015; Nassaji, 2015; Nassaji & Fotos, 2010), ISLA is defined as an area of SLA that investigates not only the effects but also the processes and mechanisms involved in any form-focused intervention (explicit or implicit) with the aim of facilitating language learning and development. Instructed SLA differs from naturalistic SLA, which refers to second language (L 2) acquisition taking place through exposure to language in naturalistic language learning settings with no formal intervention (Doughty, 2003). It is also different from classroom instruction with no focus on form. Furthermore, although instructed SLA is often taken to refer to what is learned inside the classroom, instructed SLA can also take place outside the classroom through, for xample, various instructional strategies (such as feedback, tasks, or explanation) that are often associated with instruction. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} the processes involved in SLA in and outside the classroom are exactly the same. Although there might be commonalities in learning processes, the classroom context has its unique features that might have an impact on learning. For example, in classroom learning a group of learners come together in a particular place to learn the language jointly during a given period of time. This might have an impact on learning opportunities in terms of the nature of the discourse created, learners’ participation, interaction, and engagement with language. As Allwright (1984, p. 156) pointed out, language interaction in the classroom setting is collectively constructed by all learners and “the importance of interaction in classroom learning is precisely that it entails this joint management of learning. ”</p...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 {{provides}} an historical {{analysis of the}} role of practical production in media education in England. It discusses its varied educational aims. The need to consider practical work as a form of writing is advanced. Traditional notions of media education have possessed few theories of language and learning and have failed to conceptualise a relationship between critical understanding and making media. Discussion of 'media literacy' and 'visual literacy' is followed by an exploration of models of the writing process and the limits of the metaphor of literacy when applied to forms of media production. Selective accounts of theories of writing <b>instruction</b> (<b>drawing</b> upon models of the writing process), conclude that there are problems with the metaphor of media literacy. By contrast Cultural Studies has conceptualised creative productions by young people in terms that evoke notions of the written. The central research question is formulated in Chapter 2 : what sense can we make of media production using theories of writing; and thus by implication what change to such theories might be made using data drawn from educational research on media production? In Chapter 3 discussion of methodological questions draws attention to two traditions: Cultural Studies work on media audiences. and classroom based action research. Different methods of textual analysis are applied to media productions by young people in the next four chapters (4 - 7) within the specific histories of several classrooms in North London schools. Drawing together the argument of these case studies Chapter 8 describes findings from the research and discusses five key themes: the relationship between reading and writing, or media consumption and production; the role of genre and production technologies; the concepts of level and audience; the role of meta-language within the production process; and the pedagogic implications of the study. Finally the thesis suggests the need to develop a social theory of writing. ...|$|E
