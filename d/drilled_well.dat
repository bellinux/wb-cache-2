40|$|Makassar {{is one of}} the {{big cities}} in Indonesia which is the center of {{population}} concentration, the center of industrial area, and the economic center in south Sulawesi. Cause Makassar's water demand is increasing. To get the water requirement, the community made a lot of wells to fulfill their needs. Communities take groundwater by <b>drilling</b> <b>wells</b> because the water is relatively better than groundwater on the surface. In addition, groundwater exploitation is growing rapidly because there are many affordable groundwater drilling companies available. Therefore, the research is done how to <b>drill</b> <b>well</b> Manggala sub-district in Makassar City. This research was conducted to answer the questions that arose, how the model spreading wells, how to reservoir wellbore and how well water quality of <b>drill</b> <b>well</b> in Manggala Sub-district of Makassar City. The method used is direct interviews to the public to record their own wells. The wellbore data in Manggala sub-district taken has a space of approximately 500 meters. The distribution model of 62 <b>drilled</b> <b>wells</b> obtained contained three deep <b>drilling</b> <b>wells,</b> eight medium-length <b>drilling</b> <b>wells,</b> and 51 shallow <b>drill</b> <b>wells.</b> Most of the <b>drilled</b> <b>wells</b> recorded in Manggala Sub-district are shallow <b>drill</b> <b>wells.</b> Salted salt wells in Manggala sub-district are found only in shallow wells. Of 51 shallow <b>drill</b> <b>wells</b> there are nine <b>drilled</b> <b>wells</b> with salty water. This shows that the shallow <b>drill</b> <b>wells</b> in Manggala sub-district are influenced by the surface water of the salty Tallo River. The state of wells in and around the District Manggala water condition is still good. All deep wells and deep depths in Manggala sub-district are still fresh, clear and odorless. This shows that the deep and medium wells in Manggala sub-district have not been intruded by saltwater from the Tallo river...|$|R

40|$|The {{economics}} of <b>drilling</b> offshore <b>wells</b> is important as we <b>drill</b> more <b>wells</b> in deeper water. Drilling-related problems, including stuck pipe, lost circulation, and excessive mud cost, show {{the need for}} better drilling technology. If we can solve these problems, the {{economics of}} <b>drilling</b> the <b>wells</b> will improve, thus enabling the industry to <b>drill</b> <b>wells</b> that were previously uneconomical. Managed pressure drilling (MPD) is a new technology that enables a driller to more precisely control annular pressures in the wellbore to prevent these drillingrelated problems. This paper traces the history of MPD, showing how different techniques can reduce drilling problems. MPD improves the economics of <b>drilling</b> <b>wells</b> by reducing <b>drilling</b> problems. Further economic studies are necessary to determine exactly how much cost savings MPD can provide in certain situation.

50|$|Ohio {{was one of}} the {{original}} modern-energy states in the world starting in the 19th century and has a storied history. The first discovery of oil from a <b>drilled</b> <b>well</b> and first offshore oil rig placed in world history occurred in Ohio in 1814 in Noble County, and 1891 at Grand Lake St. Marys. Ohio was the country's lead producer of oil between 1895 and 1903, until technology allowed further developments throughout the nation. Since that first well drilled in 1814 by Silas Thora and Robert McKee in Noble County, the state has drilled 273,000 wells, ranking it fourth nationally behind Texas, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania historically.|$|E

Production tubing protects wellbore casing from wear, tear, corrosion, and deposition of by-products, such as sand / silt, paraffins, and asphaltenes. Along with other components that constitute the production string, it provides a continuous bore from the production zone to the wellhead through which oil and gas can be produced. It is usually between five and ten centimeters in diameter and is held inside the casing {{through the use of}} expandable packing devices. Purpose and design of production tubing is to enable quick, efficient, and safe installation, removal and re-installation.|$|E

50|$|Drilled wells {{are usually}} cased with a factory-made pipe, {{typically}} steel (in air rotary or cable tool drilling) or plastic/PVC (in mud rotary wells, {{also present in}} wells drilled into solid rock). The casing is constructed by welding, either chemically or thermally, segments of casing together. If the casing is installed during the drilling, most drills will drive the casing into the ground as the bore hole advances, while some newer machines will actually allow for the casing to be rotated and drilled into the formation {{in a similar manner}} as the bit advancing just below. PVC or plastic is typically welded and then lowered into the <b>drilled</b> <b>well,</b> vertically stacked with their ends nested and either glued or splined together. The sections of casing are usually 6 m or more in length, and 6 to 12 in in diameter, depending on the intended use of the well and local groundwater conditions.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} led to {{the first}} prototype, built in 1968. The device consisted of a cylindrical shell filled with solid propellant, {{with a number of}} de Laval nozzles installed in the nose cone. The rocket was positioned nose down and the propellant ignited; hot gases escaped through the nozzles at supersonic speeds. Nozzles aimed downwards were responsible for demolition of the ground underneath the rocket; the next series of nozzles, aimed sideways, expanded the <b>drilled</b> <b>well.</b> Gas escaped between the device's shell and the walls of the well at speeds of up to 100 m/s, carrying along chunks of pulverized rock up to 15 cm across. In the process, the gas significantly cooled down through contact with the shaft's walls. Most of the energy contained in the propellant (5 to 100 thousand hp) was spent on the actual digging, while the device lowered itself deeper into the well under its own weight. Tsiferov's device was capable of drilling the well tens of metres deep and 250-1000 mm in diameter, {{depending on the type of}} soil. Experiments have demonstrated that the device is able to drill holes not only in regular soil, but through solid rock, permafrost, ice and aquifers.|$|E
