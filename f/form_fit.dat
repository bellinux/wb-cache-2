25|$|In 1929 the English Folk Dance Society {{held its}} Easter Vacation School on the Isle of Man. Assuming that no Manx folk dance had survived {{into the modern}} day, the Society asked Douglas instead {{to talk to them}} on local folk song. However, Douglas was able to pull {{together}} various notes on Manx dance into a <b>form</b> <b>fit</b> to be presented to the Society. Through the assistance of teachers and pupils at Albert Road School in Ramsey, Douglas was able to have three of these reconstructed dances performed: 'The Manx Dirk Dance', 'Hyndaa yn Bwoailley' and 'Eunyssagh Vona'.|$|E

He {{spent most of}} the season in the seconds and kicked one goal for the year. The next cricket season he again played for Our Boys and his school. On Boxing Day 1886, Wilson {{represented}} Northern Tasmania in the annual North v South match in Hobart. After a match in February 1887, Launceston's Daily Telegraph described Wilson as [...] "from his present <b>form,</b> <b>fit</b> for any eleven in Tasmania".

5000|$|According to the ASME Y14.5-2009 [...] standard, {{the purpose}} of {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies. The datum reference frame can describe how the part fits or functions. GD&T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more tolerance zone than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired <b>form,</b> <b>fit</b> (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances.

Flared jeans also made a comeback from the mid-1990s onward, furthering the move away from the drainpipe styles.|$|R
