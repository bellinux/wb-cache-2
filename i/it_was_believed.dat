5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed,</b> incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art of Rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E
5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> {{that the}} signal {{had been sent}} using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 {{it was pointed out}} that this had not been {{replaced}} until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E

Police commissioners ordered the closing of all barrooms and saloons.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation {{would be the most}} practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta.

Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Examples of extortionate {{ransomware}} became {{prominent in}} May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> {{large enough to}} be computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt.
