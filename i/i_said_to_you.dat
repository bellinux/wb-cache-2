25|$|Emin's two self-portraits taken {{inside her}} beach hut, The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here I (2000) and The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here II (2000) are a diptych {{although}} they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on her knees inside her beach hut which she and friend Sarah Lucas had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{spent time}} by the sea in Whitstable together, using a beach hut that she uprooted and turned into art in 1999 with the title The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> is Don't Leave Me Here, and that was {{destroyed}} in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire.|$|E
25|$|The hut itself {{later became}} the {{sculpture}} The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999). They are part of museum collections including Tate Modern, the Saatchi Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery and have been mass produced as postcards sold in museum shops around the world.|$|E

Listen, Friedel: when thou camest up, {{in all the}} whirl of eagerness and glad preparation, with thy grave face and murmur that Jobst had put forked stakes in the stream, it was past man's {{endurance}} to be baulked of the fray. Thou hast forgotten what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> then, good Friedel?" ...|$|R

25|$|Emin {{has often}} {{made use of}} found objects in her work from the early use of a {{cigarette}} box found {{in a car crash}} in which her uncle died. The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

But if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> 'You're going to have a great new job – it's a life-defining job – but you're going to work 14–15 hours a day, and by the way, you'll never know what hours those are – sometimes you'll start at noon and work until 3 a.m., other times you won't know when or where it will be [...]' It can be very difficult, it requires an amazing amount of stamina. It's easier to do if you're still reaching for the stars, it's a lot tougher if you're already a star, if you've already {{reached the top of the}} mountain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I've {{believed}} it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{after that}} talk {{we had a}} month ago--but I felt sure. I knew you would," [...] she declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sally!" [...] said Moses, {{breaking}} {{in with a}} deep voice {{on one of these}} monologues. [...] "Do you remember some presumptuous things <b>I</b> once <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> in this place?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On 24 May 2004, {{a fire in}} a Momart storage {{warehouse}} in East London destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including Emin's famous tent with appliquéd letters, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 ("The Tent") (1995) and The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Is Don't Leave Me Here ("The Hut") (1999), Emin's blue wooden beach hut that she bought with fellow artist Sarah Lucas and shared with her boyfriend of the time, the gallerist Carl Freedman. Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, {{at the loss of}} the artworks in the fire. She commented, [...] "I'm also upset about those people whose wedding got bombed last week , and people being dug out from under 400ft of mud in the Dominican Republic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{all that}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> then <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{thinking}} that {{it was for the}} best. You, at any rate, will not be angry with me for loving my own son better than I love any one else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are a very}} wearisome person," [...] she declared. [...] "Did {{you ever}} know me to change my mind? Every word <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> {{absolutely}} mean. No more, no less!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no; {{not exactly}} {{to say what}} <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> When one loves a girl as I love her, somehow--I don't know how--But I am ready to do so at once.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [After a pause.] If <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that I {{cared for}} her, perhaps loved her even--you would sneer at me, wouldn't you? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I wish to {{be alone}} with you for a few minutes. Since what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> this morning, you have written to Colonel Osborne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Slidder," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> really grieved, for I saw by his earnest {{face that}} he meant it, [...] "would you go and steal after all <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about that sin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sampson, I {{have come}} to ask your pardon again," [...] says Mr. Warrington, rising up. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to-day <b>to</b> <b>you</b> was very cruel and unjust, and unlike a gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, I {{have gone}} back to our old programme," [...] said Jock. [...] "I have sent in my papers; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> for <b>I</b> thought you would only vex yourself." ...|$|R

6000|$|LORD GORING. How clever of you {{to guess}} it! [Takes up his hat and cane.] Good-bye, Lady Chiltern! You will {{remember}} what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> won’t you? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell me {{one thing}} first," [...] she resumed. [...] "Have I been right in what <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> so far? <b>Is</b> {{it true that you}} were in a darkened room when you saw me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Isabel, though, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> before, my cousin, Miss Tartan, that strange, and willful, nun-like girl, {{is at all}} hazards, mystically {{resolved}} to come and live with us, yet it must be quite impossible that her friends can approve in her such a singular step; a step even more singular, Isabel, than thou, in thy unsophisticatedness, can'st at all imagine. I shall be immensely deceived if they do not, to their very utmost, strive against it. Now what I am going to add may be quite unnecessary, but I can not avoid speaking it, for all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know so. As {{for what}} <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to-night, I said {{it for your}} good. You know I have been always a staunch friend to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nehushta, Nehushta," [...] said Ithiel reprovingly, [...] "have <b>I</b> not <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{that you}} should not walk so far afield without some of the brethren as an escort? You might, perchance, have met thieves, or drunken men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not till I {{have read}} it," [...] he calmly returned. [...] "Mary," [...] {{he said at}} last, looking up, [...] "this letter more than justifies what <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> dozens of times. No sweeter spirit ever existed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{knew which}} {{of your hands}} was the least spoilt, I would ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> let me touch it,' said Bella, 'for the last time. But not because I repent of what <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> For <b>I</b> don't. It's true!' ...|$|R
