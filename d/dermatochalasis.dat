5000|$|<b>Dermatochalasis</b> {{commonly}} {{affects the}} elderly, although {{sometimes it is}} congenitally acquired. The elderly version may begin to develop as early as 40 years of age, {{and it continues to}} progress with age. [...] The congenital version may begin around 20 years of age. [...] There is no racial predisposition towards developing <b>dermatochalasis,</b> and men and women are equally affected.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dermatochalasis</b> {{is caused}} by a loss of {{elasticity}} in the connective tissue supporting the structure of the front portion of the eyelid. Normally, in Caucasians, the orbicularis muscle and overlying skin form a crease near the tarsal border. [...] In <b>dermatochalasis,</b> the excess tissues hangs down, over the front edge of the eyelid. The excess tissue can sometimes obstruct the visual field, especially the superior visual field. [...] In severe cases, it may obstruct as much as 50 percent of the superior visual field.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>dermatochalasis</b> is {{severe enough}} to obstruct the {{peripheral}} or superior visual fields, then it may be treated with a surgical procedure called blepharoplasty. [...] In blepharoplasty surgery, excess skin, muscle and fat are removed. While the improvement of vision is an indication for blepharoplasty on the superior eyelid, if the visual fields are not obstructed, it may be performed for cosmetic reasons. In general, blepharoplasty of the inferior eyelid is considered cosmetic, as <b>dermatochalasis</b> in the lower eyelid does not interfere with vision.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dermatochalasis</b> is {{a medical}} condition, defined as an excess of skin in the upper or lower eyelid, also known as [...] "baggy eyes." [...] It may be either an {{acquired}} or a congenital condition. It is generally treated with blepharoplasty.|$|E
50|$|With aging, a {{prominent}} white ring develops in {{the periphery of}} the cornea called arcus senilis. Aging causes laxity, downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as ectropion, entropion, <b>dermatochalasis,</b> and ptosis. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction (posterior vitreous detachment or PVD) and its opacities — visible as floaters — gradually increase in number.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the localization {{and severity of}} <b>dermatochalasis</b> and accompanying pseudoptosis with age. METHODS:One hundred and thirteen subjects with <b>dermatochalasis</b> {{were included in the}} study. Age, gender and body mass index(BMI) of the subjects were recorded. Palpebral fissure height(PFH) and marginal reflex distance(MRD) were measured in the primary position. The severity of <b>dermatochalasis</b> was assesed as Stage 1 : behind eyelid margin(minimum 1 mm); Stage 2 : inline with eyelid margin; Stage 3 : before eyelid margin. RESULTS: Mean age of the subjects were 52. 7 ± 8. 6 (range 32 to 74) y. Thirty-six cases(31. 9 %) were male and 77 (68. 1 %) were female. The mean BMI was 30. 3 ± 4. 7 (range 21. 5 to 36. 6) kg/m 2, mean PFH was 10. 7 ± 1. 6 (range 7 to 15) mm, mean MRD was 3. 8 ± 1. 2 (range 1 to 5) mm. In 30 (26. 5 %) of the subjects <b>dermatochalasis</b> was localized behind eyelid margin, in 38 (33. 6 %) it was inline with eyelid margin and in 45 (39. 8 %) it was before eyelid margin. There was pseudoptosis due to <b>dermatochalasis</b> in 50 (44. 2 %) of the subjects. Age was significantly different in terms of <b>dermatochalasis</b> severity. Mean ages of subjects with <b>dermatochalasis</b> localization behind or inline with eyelid margin(50. 3 ± 6. 6, 50. 5 ± 9. 5 y), were significantly lower than subjects with <b>dermatochalasis</b> localization before eyelid corner(56. 0 ± 8. 2 y).

An Ocular Response Analyzer device was used to measure corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), and corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc). Results: We found no significant differences in the mean values of the CH, CRF, and IOPcc of all groups (P= 0. 75, P= 0. 93, and P= 0. 11, respectively). However, CH and IOPcc were negatively correlated in Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 patients (P= 0. 013, r=− 0. 49; P= 0. 015, r=− 0. 52; and P= 0. 011, r=− 0. 47, respectively), but this correlation was not apparent in the Group 4 patients (P= 0. 57, r= 0. 12).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{highlight}} a {{case series}} of patients manifesting epiphora and misdirection of tears laterally or along the upper-eyelid skin crease. This association has been termed upper-eyelid wick syndrome. We describe the clinical features and outcomes of management of these patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients referred to 2 oculoplastic centers during a 6 -year period for epiphora, who {{were considered to}} have misdirection of tears related {{in some way to}} upper-eyelid <b>dermatochalasis.</b> RESULTS: Nine patients (7 women and 2 men; mean [SD] age, 61. 2 [11. 3] years, range, 41 - 76 years) with bilateral epiphora and lateral spillover (100 %), occasionally combined with upper-eyelid wetting (n= 2). All patients had upper-eyelid <b>dermatochalasis.</b> Five patients had uppereyelid skin obscuring and in contact with the lateral canthus (type 1), and in 4 the lateral canthus was only partially obscured by upper-eyelid skin (type 2). Five patients (56 %) had linear excoriation of skin in the lateral canthus. All patients underwent upper-eyelid blepharoplasty, 3 combined with ptosis repair and 3 combined with eyebrow-lift. All patients achieved 80 % to 100 % improvement in epiphora following surgical intervention to the upper eyelid. The mean (range) follow-up was 2. 8 (1 - 6) years. CONCLUSIONS: We defined upper-eyelid wick syndrome as the misdirection of tears laterally or along the uppereyelid skin crease causing epiphora, related in some way to upper-eyelid <b>dermatochalasis.</b> In all cases, epiphora improved with treatment of upper-eyelid <b>dermatochalasis.</b> Although recognized among physicians, this has never been formally described in the ophthalmic literature, to our knowledge.

40|$|We {{investigated}} lymphatics morphology {{and expression}} of endothelin (ET- 1) axis molecules in human eyelids affected by an inflammatory state (chalazion) and an age-related degenerative condition (<b>dermatochalasis).</b> Lymphatics were immunohistologically detected by D 2 - 40 /LYVE- 1 staining. Absorbing lymphatic vessels were localized in papillary dermis and around skin appendages with distinctive morphology. In chalazion, D 2 - 40 reactive flattened lymphatics profiles were compressed by inflammatory infiltrate; in <b>dermatochalasis</b> large fully opened lymphatics were observed, with a significantly wider total area (lymphatics lumen / 200 x field; p< 0. 05). The lymphatics density (number/ 200 x field) {{in the two}} groups was within the same range. Lymphatics dilation is possibly dependent on reduction and fragmentation of dermal elastic network, as well as of oxytalanic fibers in papillary dermis of <b>dermatochalasis,</b> as shown by Weigert’s reaction. Multifunctional peptide ET- 1, involved in vasomotion, inflammation and connective proliferation, resulted faintly and discontinuously localized on lymphatics, as well as its type A receptor. On the contrary, the consistent expression of type B receptor indicates that lymphatic endothelium is a physiological target for ET- 1, whose effects are modulated by multiple pathophysiological conditions.

40|$|Background: As the ptotic brow {{drops below}} the supraorbital rim, it can {{exacerbate}} <b>dermatochalasis</b> by pushing the adjacent {{skin of the}} upper lid further down. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the outcomes associated with a combined pretrichial brow lift and upper lid blepharoplasty in patients with <b>dermatochalasis</b> and mild to moderate brow ptosis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective case series of 46 patients with <b>dermatochalasis</b> and mild to moderate brow ptosis treated with a combined, bilateral pretrichial brow lift and upper lid blepharoplasty from January 2008 to December 2011. Main outcome measures included measurements of brow lift at 3 months post-operatively, complications encountered, patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction. Results: Outcomes from 46 patients were evaluated. The mean brow lift was 1. 85 mm at the lateral canthus, 1. 54 mm at the lateral limbus, 1. 31 mm at the mid-pupil, and 1. 07 mm at the medial limbus. Brow lift at the lateral canthus was significantly more elevated than at the medial limbus (P < 0. 001). Minor complications were encountered in seven of 46 patients (15. 2 %). Mean patient satisfaction score was 3. 20 and surgeon satisfaction 3. 24 (max = 4, very satisfied).

40|$|Purpose: To investigate, for {{the first}} time, the psychosocial {{implications}} of blepharoptosis and <b>dermatochalasis.</b> Methods: Two hundred ten individuals rated whole-face photographs {{of a series of}} patients on the basis of 11 different personal characteristics: intelligence, threat, friendliness, health, trustworthiness, hard work, mental illness, financial success, attractiveness, alcoholism, and happiness. Preoperative and postoperative photographs of both male and female patients with bilateral blepharoptosis and/or dematochalasis were used. The paired t test was used to compare preop-erative and postoperative ratings on the 11 characteristics. Results: The preoperative photographs were rated more negatively than the postoperative photographs (P <. 01 – P <. 001) on all 11 characteristics for both male and female patients by the 210 study subjects. Conclusions: Members of society seem to view individuals with blepharoptosis and <b>dermatochalasis</b> negatively. These psychosocial attitudes may lead to unjust bias toward affected patients, and surgical correction likely provides benefits beyond improved visual function.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the Abbreviated National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ 9), which is shorter than those previously published, {{as a tool}} for assessing vision-related quality of life in patients with ptosis and <b>dermatochalasis.</b> Methods: This is a cohort study of 46 patients who underwent blepharoptosis and/or upper eyelid blepharoplasty surgery by a single surgeon (CN) in 2013 in a public, academic, ambulatory care referral center. Patients included 29 who underwent blepharoplasty, 11 who underwent ptosis surgery, and 6 who underwent combined surgery. The NEI-VFQ 9 was administered pre- and postoperatively, and the composite scores were compared using Student's t-test. Survey duration was timed in a subset of patients. The hypothesis was that the NEI VFQ 9 could detect a statistically significant improvement in composite score after surgical intervention. Results: The mean pre- and postoperative NEI VFQ 9 composite scores were 74. 9 and 86. 8, respectively, in the blepharoplasty-only group (P< 0. 0001), 72. 07 and 86. 41, respectively, in the ptosis-only group (P= 0. 004), and 75. 8 and 87. 2, respectively, in the combined group (P= 0. 022). There was no correlation between the gain in composite score and the change in upper eyelid margin to reflex distance. Twenty-five patients were timed filling out the survey, and the mean was 2. 3 min.

A couple of benefits seem to be associated with permanent tattoos in the elderly: saving time (wake up with makeup); poor eyesight (difficult to apply makeup); and saving money.

Methods: The method {{was carried out}} in two patients with moderate or significant <b>dermatochalasis.</b> The areas to be excised from the infrabrow and intrabrow skin were decided upon and the area of hair transplantation was planned in the suprabrow area and the tail of the eyebrow. The skin was removed and the excised intrabrow skin was dissected into single follicular units. Tiny incisions were made with a scalpel, and grafts were inserted using fine forceps. Results: Almost all transplanted eyebrow follicles took successfully, resulting in eyebrows of a desirable shape as planned preoperatively. The reshaped eyebrows had a natural appearance since the transplanted hairs were {{similar to those of the}} original eyebrow. The eyelids still looked youthful rather than operated-on. Finally, the evidence of blepharoplasty was hardly visible and patient satisfaction was quite high. The patients felt more ease in opening their eyes and obtained a wider visual field.

40|$|For {{blepharoptosis}} repair, {{typically a}} long skin incision is made along the upper eyelid crease, the orbital septum is opened, a dissection is made until the levator aponeu-rosis is found under the preaponeurotic fat pad, and the levator aponeurosis is sutured to the tarsus at three differ-ent positions [1]. However, in 1999, Lucarelli and Lemke [2] {{introduced a new}} surgical technique, which enables blepharoptosis repair in patients who had blepharoptosis without <b>dermatochalasis,</b> with an 8 to 10 mm skin incision, exposing the tarsus through the incision and suturing the levator aponeurosis to the tarsus at just one position.

In this study, retrospective review of case series was performed. Participants: All patients who underwent ectropion or entropion surgery in a tertiary medical center between 2007 and 2014 were included. The etiology of eyelid malpositioning was involutional or cicatricial. Methods: The medical files of the study participants were reviewed for the presence and type of glaucoma, medical treatment, duration of treatment, and the amount of drops per day. These data were compared to a matched control group of 101 patients who underwent blepharoplasty for <b>dermatochalasis</b> in the same department during the same period. Main outcome measure: In this study, the prevalence of glaucoma in individuals with ectropion or entropion was the main outcome measure. Results: A total of 227 patients (57 % men, mean age: 79. 2  years) who underwent ectropion or entropion surgery comprised the study group and 101 patients who underwent upper blepharoplasty for <b>dermatochalasis</b> comprised the control group. Compared to four patients in the control group (4 %, P= 0. 01), 30 of the study patients (13. 2 %) had coexisting glaucoma.

All patients were female, aged between 40 and 75 years. The images were acquired by a photographic camera, transferred to a computer and then analyzed by the Scion Image Frame Grabber program. The evaluated parameters were upper eyelid position in primary gaze position, upper palpebral sulcus and lateral eyelid angle. The measures were obtained before and after 60 days of upper <b>dermatochalasis</b> surgery. RESULTS: After the surgery, {{there was an increase}} of upper eyelid position and upper palpebral sulcus; the lateral palpebral angle did not show any alteration. CONCLUSION: Eyelid position changes after blepharoplasty and digital image processing provides quantitative measures of the eyelid, allowing a better quantification of the surgical results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} periorbital changes {{induced by}} chronic topical therapy with daily bimatoprost 0. 03 % (Lumigan, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, U. S. A.). Methods: A clinical investigation of 5 nonconsecutive patients with unilateral glaucoma treated daily with topical bimatoprost 0. 03 % {{for up to}} 4 years prior to presentation. Results: In eyes treated with bimatoprost 0. 03 % the authors noted periorbital fat atrophy, deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus, relative enophthalmos, loss of the lower eyelid fullness, and involution of <b>dermatochalasis</b> compared with the fellow untreated eye. By inspecting old photographs the authors confirmed that these unilateral changes were not present prior to starting bimatoprost. In addition, these changes were partially reversible after discontinuation of the medication, whenever that was possible. In 2 cases imaging studies confirmed the clinical impression that these findings were not related to primary orbital pathology. Conclusions: Physicians and patients {{should be aware of}} the potential of bimatoprost 0. 03 % to produce periorbital changes...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser and {{radiosurgery}} are techniques commonly {{employed in}} oculoplastic surgery. However, {{there is no}} literature comparing their results in blepharoplasty. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Twenty Chinese patients with <b>dermatochalasis</b> underwent radiosurgery in one upper eyelid and CO 2 laser in the contralateral eyelid. Intraoperative time, hemorrhage, and pain control were assessed. Subjects were evaluated at postoperative 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months for hemorrhage and wound healing by a masked assessor. Results: All patients reported minimal pain with either technique. A significantly shorter operative time was achieved with CO 2 laser, with better intraoperative hemostasis. There {{was no significant difference}} in post-operative hemorrhage and wound swelling between radiosurgery and CO 2 laser. No significant intraoperative complications were noted. Conclusions: Both radiosurgery and CO 2 laser are equally safe and effective for upper lid blepharoplasty. CO 2 laser achieves shorter operative time with superior intraoperative hemostasis. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{photographic}} documentation {{is important}} for professional, research, and ethical concerns. This study analyzed the possible interference that the flash could cause on evaluation of lower eyelid cosmetic results. Standardized photographs with and without flash were taken of 10 patients with <b>dermatochalasis.</b> the photographs were evaluated by 3 independent observers, as before (without flash) and after (with flash) an alternative esthetic treatment of the lower eyelid. the observers rated the overall cosmetic improvement of the lower eyelid photographs on a visual analog scale. the 3 surgeons believed that there was improvement in cosmetic outcome from the first (without flash) to the second (with flash) picture. {{the results indicate that}} a simple flash addition in one of 2 consecutive photographs, taken seconds apart, could influence the impression of experienced surgeons on the final outcome of oculoplastic surgeries and may constitute a bias in observer-dependent studies.

40|$|Botulinum toxin blocks {{acetylcholine}} release at the neuromuscular junction. The drug {{which was}} initially {{found to be}} useful {{in the treatment of}} strabismus has been extremely effective in the treatment of variety of conditions, both cosmetic and noncosmetic. Some of the noncosmetic uses of botulinum toxin applications include treatment of spastic facial dystonias, temporary treatment of idiopathic or thyroid dysfunction-induced upper eyelid retraction, suppression of undesired hyperlacrimation, induction of temporary ptosis by chemodenervation in facial paralysis, and correction of lower eyelid spastic entropion. Additional periocular uses include control of synchronic eyelid and extraocular muscle movements after aberrant regeneration of cranial nerve palsies. Cosmetic effects of botulinum toxin were discovered accidentally during treatments of facial dystonias. Some of the emerging nonperiocular application for the drug includes treatment of hyperhidrosis, migraine, tension-type headaches, and paralytic spasticity. Some of the undesired side effects of periocular applications of botulinum toxin inlcude ecchymosis, rash, hematoma, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, dizziness, loss of facial expression, lower eyelid laxity, <b>dermatochalasis,</b> ectropion, epiphora, eyebrow and eyelid ptosis, lagophthalmos, keratitis sicca, and diplopia...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{surgical}} treatment for Hallermann-Streiff syndrome in a patient with ocular manifestations of esotropia, entropion, and blepharoptosis. A 54 -year-old man visited Yeouido St. Mary’s Hospital complaining of ocular discomfort due to cilia touching the corneas of both eyes for several years. He had a bird-like face, pinched nose, hypotrichosis of the scalp, mandibular hypoplasia with forward displacement of the temporomandibular joints, a small mouth, and proportional short stature. His ophthalmic features included sparse eyelashes and eyebrows, microphthalmia, nystagmus, lower lid entropion in the right eye, and upper lid entropion with blepharoptosis in both eyes. There was esodeviation of the eyeball of more than 100 prism diopters at near and distance, and there were limitations in ocular movement on lateral gaze. The capsulopalpebral fascia was repaired to treat the right lower lid entropion, but an additional Quickert suture was required to prevent recurrence. Blepharoplasty and levator palpebrae repair were performed for blepharoptosis and <b>dermatochalasis.</b> Three months after lid surgery, the right medial rectus muscle was recessed 7. 5 mm, the left medial rectus was recessed 7. 25 mm, and the left lateral rectus muscle was resected 8. 0 mm...|$|E
40|$|This journal suppl. entitled: Supplement: American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery, Twenty-Sixth Annual Meeting, Boston, Massachusetts, April 5 –April 9, 2006 Session: OphthalmologyBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser and {{radiosurgery}} are techniques commonly {{employed in}} oculoplastic surgery. There are surprisingly few publications comparing their results in Asian blepharoplasty. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty Chinese patients with <b>dermatochalasis</b> underwent radiosurgery (Ellman Surgitron) in one upper eyelid and CO 2 laser in the contralateral eyelid {{by the same}} surgeon. Subjects were evaluated on postoperative 1 hour, day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 3 months after surgery for pain control, edema, erythema, ecchymosis and wound healing by a blinded assessor and patient questionnaires and scored to a scale of 1 – 6. RESULTS: Patients reported minimal intra-and postoperative pain with either technique. A shorter mean operative time was achieved with CO 2 laser, due to superior intraoperative hemostasis. No significant intraoprative complications were noted in both techniques. There appeared to be {{no significant differences in}} postoperative edema, erythema, ecchymosis and wound healing between radiosurgery and CO 2 laser. CONCLUSION: Both radiosurgery and CO 2 laser are equally safe and effective surgical tools for the upper blepharoplasty in Asians...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To quantitatively and qualitatively {{evaluate}} postoperative {{outcomes and}} patient satisfaction after upper blepharoplasty and to correlate the findings with changes between preoperative and postoperative eyelid measurements using a digital imaging system. Methods: A total of 60 eyelids in 30 patients with <b>dermatochalasis</b> who were {{treated in the}} ambulatory center of the Department of Oculoplastic Surgery at the Anápolis Ophthalmology Hospital were evaluated. Patients ranged from 40 to 80 years of age. Photographs were taken before the upper blepharoplasty procedure and 90 days after as well. The images were transferred to the ImageJ 1. 34 n program. The parameters analyzed were palpebral fissure height in primary position and margin-crease distance. The correlations between these measurements and patient satisfaction 90 days after surgery were evaluated. Results: This study revealed {{an increase in the}} margin-crease distance after upper blepharoplasty and a high positive correlation (0. 64) between the increase in this height and the level of satisfaction that the patients attributed to the surgery. There was no statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative palpebral fissure heights. Conclusion: The margin-crease distance may serve as a quantitative measurement of a good cosmetic and functional outcome, since it {{has been found to be}} strong correlated with patient satisfaction...|$|E
