40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} {{for evaluating the}} host preference of dodders. This technique takes account of the frequency and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestations,</b> the proportion <b>of</b> the resource use and availability, the resource distribution {{as well as the}} defence mechanisms of the hosts. The process categorises not only the host species but each infestation, respectively, and establishes an order of preference among the host species. This method considers also the fact that the preference status of a host species may considerably vary under different circumstances (under different species environments and/or in different habitats). The method was tested on Cuscuta europaea at 75 localities in Hungary. During the study 1, 189 plant-parasite relationships were examined and categorised. This dodder was found to parasitise almost every plant, which came into contact with it in the natural habitats, however, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestations</b> greatly varied among the host species.

30|$|In total, nine {{species of}} Copepoda {{were found on}} hosts in July of 2009 ~ 2011. Typical planktonic copepods (Calanus, Microsetella, and Microcalanus) and some benthopelagic and benthic species (Ectinosoma, Cyclopina, and Zaus) were found in low occurrences; their prevalences did not exceed 5 %, and these copepods should be {{considered}} incidental visitors. The benthopelagic harpacticoid copepods Tisbe, Harpacticus, and Dactylopusia were the most abundant, with high prevalences and mean <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation,</b> and should be classified as commensals.

We suggest that the recorded absence of symbiotic copepods from crab branchial chambers {{in our previous studies}} in August of 2004 ~ 2008 may be explained by predation or competition with the symbiotic amphipod Ischyrocerus commensalis, which was confirmed by analysis of amphipod gut contents.|$|R
40|$|Grains {{are subject}} to {{contamination}} by mycotoxins which are metabolic by-products of various fungi.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Brazil, tungiasis is endemic in some resource-poor {{communities}} where various domestic and sylvatic animals act as reservoirs for this zoonosis. To determine {{the effect of}} control measures on the prevalence and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> of human and animal tungiasis, a repeated cross-sectional survey with intervention was carried out. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a traditional fishing community in Northeast Brazil, humans and reservoir animals were treated, and premise-spraying using an insecticide was done, while a second fishing community served as a control. Both communities were followed up 10 times during a 12 -month period. At baseline, prevalence of tungiasis was 43 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 35 %- 51 %) and 37 % (95 % CI: 31 %- 43 %) in control and intervention villages, respectively. During the study, prevalence of tungiasis dropped to 10 % (95 % CI: 8 %- 13 %; p< 0. 001) in the intervention village, while the prevalence remained at a high level in the control village. However, after one year, {{at the end of the}} study, in both communities the prevalence of the infestation had reached pre-intervention levels. Whereas the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> was significantly reduced in the intervention community (p< 0. 001), and remained low at the end of the study (p< 0. 001), it did not change in the control village. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows that a reduction of prevalence and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> is possible, but in impoverished communities a long-lasting reduction of disease occurrence can only be achieved by the regular treatment of infested humans, the elimination of animal reservoirs, and, likely, through environmental changes.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of environmental factors and host factors in explaining variation in prevalence and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> flea parasitism in small mammal communities is poorly established. We examined these relationships in an East African savanna landscape, considering multiple host levels: across individuals within a local population, across populations within species, and across species within a landscape. We sampled fleas from 2, 672 small mammals of 27 species. This included a total of 8, 283 fleas, with 5 genera and 12 species identified. Across individual hosts within a site, both rodent body mass and season affected total <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> flea <b>infestation,</b> although the explanatory power of these factors was generally modest (, 10 %). Across host populations in the landscape, we found consistently positive effects of host density and negative effects of vegetation cover on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> flea <b>infestation.</b> Other factors explored (host diversity, annual rainfall, anthropogenic disturbance, and soil properties) tended to have lower and less consistent explanatory power.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tungiasis, a {{parasitic}} {{skin disease}} {{caused by the}} female sand flea Tunga penetrans, is a prevalent condition in impoverished communities in the tropics. In this setting, the ectoparasitosis is associated with important morbidity. It causes disfigurement and mutilation of the feet. Feasible and effective treatment is not available. So far prevention is the only means to control tungiasis-associated morbidity. METHODOLOGY: In two villages in Central Madagascar, we assessed {{the efficacy of the}} availability of closed shoes and the twice-daily application of a plant-based repellent active against sand fleas (Zanzarin) in comparison to a control group without intervention. The study population was randomized into three groups: shoe group, repellent group and control group and monitored for ten weeks. The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation,</b> the attack rate and the severity of tungiasis-associated morbidity were assessed every two weeks. FINDINGS: In the repellent group, the median attack rate became zero already after two weeks. The intensity of the infestation decreased constantly during the observation period and tungiasis-associated morbidity was lowered to an insignificant level. In the shoe group, only a marginal decrease in the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> and in the attack rate was observed. At week 10, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation,</b> the attack rate and the severity score for acute tungiasis remained significantly higher in the shoe group than in the repellent group. Per protocol analysis showed that the protective effect of shoes was closely related to the regularity with which shoes were worn. CONCLUSIONS: Although shoes were requested by the villagers and wearing shoes was encouraged by the investigators {{at the beginning of the}} study, the availability of shoes only marginally influenced the attack rate of female sand fleas. The twice-daily application of a plant-based repellent active against sand fleas reduced the attack to zero and lowered tungiasis-associated morbidity to an insignificant level...|$|E
40|$|Tungiasis is a {{parasitic}} {{skin disease}} {{caused by the}} female sand flea Tunga penetrans. The disease is frequent in resource-poor communities in South America and sub-Saharan Africa and affects {{the poorest of the}} poor. Sand flea disease is associated with a considerable morbidity and may lead to tetanus in non-vaccinated individuals. The degree of morbidity depends on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation,</b> i. e., the number of embedded sand fleas a person has. Since tungiasis is a zoonosis involving a host of animal reservoirs, and because an effective treatment is not at hand, in resource-poor settings elimination is not feasible. Preventing morbidity to develop is therefore the only means to protect exposed individuals from sand flea disease. Similar to other arthropods, sand fleas can be repelled before they penetrate into the skin. In this study we show that the intermittent application of a plant-based repellent, of which the major component is coconut oil, reduces the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> dramatically during the whole transmission season and prevents tungiasis-associated morbidity from developing. The prevention can be performed at the household level by the affected individuals themselves with minimal input from the health sector...|$|E

We tested the relationship between <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> and lizard body size for each species using regression analysis. The prevalences and mean intensities (+ one standard deviation) of infestation on each host species were, respectively: 100 %; 86. 4 + 94. 6 in T. torquatus (n = 62); 100 %; 20. 9 + 9. 3 in M. agilis (n = 7); 100 %; 11. 1 + 13. 1 in M. macrorhyncha (n = 12); and 95. 2 %; 19. 1 + 16. 8 in C. littoralis (n = 21). Only for C. littoralis did body size significantly affect the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infestation</b> (r = 0. 27, p = 0. 02). For all lizard species, the body parts where chiggers occurred with the highest intensity were those of skin folds and joint regions...|$|E
30|$|Inoculation soybean with N. calcicola HN 9 extract sooner {{accumulated}} {{action of}} SOD in the aphid-infested leaves. Activity of this enzyme was strongly increased to peak within 12 – 24  hpi, and maintained {{in high level}} up to 96  hpi. There was an appreciable proportion between the accumulated activity <b>of</b> SOD and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> aphid <b>infestation</b> within 6 – 72  hpi. The highest activity of SOD enhanced by <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> 30 aphid individuals at 12  hpi was 20.79  nkat mg− 1 protein, having by 2.61 - and 3.32 -fold higher than that in control and at the beginning, respectively (Fig.  7; the solid lines). ANOVA analyses confirmed that SOD activities in the aphid-infested/cyanobacteria inoculated soybean leaves were significant higher than that in control plants within 6 – 96  hpi.|$|R
40|$|Logged and unlogged {{stands of}} Engelmann spruce-subalpine fire were {{evaluated}} in spruce beetle outbreak areas infested about 15, 25, 50, and 100 years ago. Seedling regeneration was generally adequate except in heavily logged areas, although seedlings are often damaged, apparently by animals. Species composition was dramatically altered {{in favor of}} fir in the unlogged spurce-fir type. In the overstory, fir may predominate for many years but eventually the spruce will replace it. When the forest reaches a basal area of 150 to 200 + ft 2 per acre in predominantly large spruce, the potential for spurce beetle outbreaks increases. Changes in species composition with different <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> beetle <b>infestations</b> and over several centuries are hypothesized...|$|R
40|$|The <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> {{sapstain}} <b>infestation</b> on tusam logs (Pinus merkusii Jungh. et de Vr.) was {{studied in}} a field of Suka- bumi Forest District, West Java. The material used consisted of one meter long fresh logs taken from newly felled trees. The tested logs were tried at the filed for three months using four storage levels. Surface staining and the loss of water content were weekly observed for one. month, while the rate of staining penetration was observed for three months after the treatment. The result showed that the degree of staining defect was significantly defferent within the period of inspection, but that was not among the log sections. The rate of staining penetration is approximately 5 cm per week...|$|R
