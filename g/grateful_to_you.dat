500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I am <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E
2500|$|Sothern died at {{his home}} in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in Southampton Old Cemetery, Southampton. [...] Sothern was such a notorious {{practical}} joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke. [...] His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death. [...] A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children. [...] Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate. [...] Gilbert suggested that she [...] "underlet" [...] Foggerty's Fairy to him, and he eventually had it produced. [...] Later, she wrote to him: [...] "Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for sparing me any trouble or anxiety." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
2500|$|Sothern came to England for {{a six-week}} holiday in June 1880, still {{planning}} to produce Foggerty's Fairy in New York. After one illness {{and a short}} European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the autumn. His health declined until he died in January 1881 never having performed the play but leaving behind a heavily-annotated copy. Sothern's sister, Mary Cowan, was the beneficiary of Sothern's will. Sothern's widow contested the will, and it took Cowan until 31 May to probate it. Gilbert contacted Cowan soon after Sothern's death and offered her his help. He suggested that she [...] "underlet" [...] Foggerty's Fairy to him for £525 and half of whatever he received for it until she had been paid 1,500 guineas. The play was first offered to comic actor J. L. Toole, but the deal fell through, and Gilbert next offered the play to actor Charles Wyndham, who was then manager of the Criterion Theatre. After Gilbert had settled these financial dealings with Mrs. Cowan, she wrote to him: [...] "Allow {{me to say that}} of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for sparing me any trouble or anxiety." ...|$|E
