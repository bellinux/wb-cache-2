5|$|At this time, C Flight arrived. As it dipped <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{overcast}} {{toward the}} dogfight, Gardiner and Taylor went astray. Maybery {{was attacked by}} a green Pfalz D.III. Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} pleistocene, the river {{probably}} {{sprang from the}} north of the Vale of Holmesdale across <b>the</b> North <b>Downs</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Merstham Gap, a wind gap. In more recent times, rainwater falling on <b>the</b> <b>Down</b> percolates <b>through</b> <b>the</b> chalk and reappears as springs in central Croydon, Beddington, and Carshalton. The occasional stream, known as the Bourne, which runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Caterham valley (and Smitham Bottom in Coulsdon) is a source of the River Wandle but only surfaces after heavy rainfall. A series of ditches and culverts channels the water from Purley to Croydon.|$|R

5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of {{the conquest}} {{as seen from}} the point of view of the {{defeated}} highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619. A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility of Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E

5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire magma sea. These columns are hollow {{and can be}} broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring entire fortresses to ruin.|$|E
5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} seeping <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The geothermally heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, {{which has}} resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor. The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{returned}} the post-score kickoff to their 20-yard line, and Tech's offense began work. Thomas gained {{a first down}} with three consecutive runs, then the Hokies fumbled when a backwards pass from DeShazo fell incomplete. Indiana recovered the ball, and the turnover allowed the Hoosiers' offense to start work from the Tech 25-yard line. On Indiana's first play, however, Virginia Tech cornerback Tyronne Drakeford intercepted Paci's pass. Following the turnover, Tech's offense started work at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, then DeShazo scrambled for another. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed Tech backward, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and <b>down</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
