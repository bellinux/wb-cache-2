A related term fitness is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead, scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage of organisms that survive to reproductive age. From this perspective, crossbred plants and animals exhibiting heterosis may have [...] "superior" [...] traits, but this does not necessarily equate to any evidence of outright [...] "genetic superiority". Use of the term [...] "superiority" [...] is commonplace for example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better-yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild, making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question of [...] "genetic superiority" [...] is even more problematic due to the historical and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of politics, not science.|$|E
40|$|Immunosenescence <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term</b> {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} differences observed between younger and older individuals in a broad range of immune parameters. Humans and mice are the best-studied, but indications of immunose-nescence have also been reported in primates, dogs, cats and horses. 1 Although often referred to as age-associated changes to immunity, and almost always assumed to be detrimental to immune responses, in most cases, the differences between old and young are neither known to be detrimental nor demon-strated to have changed with age in that individual. This would require longitudinal studies of the same individuals over time, which are clearly challenging in long-lived species like humans, but are also quite rare even in mice, mostly due to cost issues.

40|$|Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) {{oligomers}} {{may be the}} proximate neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease (AD). "Oligomer" <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term</b> {{because many}} kinds have been reported and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and higher-order assemblies. We report here results of studies in which specific oligomers have been stabilized structurally, fractionated in pure form, and then studied by {{using a combination of}} CD spectroscopy, Thioflavin T fluorescence, EM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and neurotoxicity assays. Aβ monomers were largely unstructured, but oligomers exhibited order-dependent increases in β-sheet content. EM and AFM data suggest that dimerization and subsequent monomer addition are processes in which significant and asymmetric monomer conformational changes occur. Oligomer secondary structure and order correlated directly with fibril nucleation activity. Neurotoxic activity increased disproportionately (order dependence > 1) with oligomer order. The structure - activity correlations reported here significantly extend our understanding of the conformational dynamics, structure, and relative toxicity of pure Aβ oligomers of specific order...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Excess {{capacity}} results because fishermen do {{not have}} an incentive to conserve fish in-the-sea causing them to 1 over-invest in the capital used to harvest fish as well as other production or factor inputs. Excess capacity like overcapitalization and overfishing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symptom of our regulated, open access fishery management system. Because capacity has <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term</b> in the fisheries literature, it has been poorly understood by fisheries managers. Excess capacity exists in a fishery when the yield from the fishery exceeds the point where net benefits to society <b>are</b> at <b>a</b> maximum; i. e., once maximum economic yield (MEY) is exceeded. Since MEY often occurs before maximum sustainable yield (MSY) <b>is</b> achieved in <b>a</b> developing fishery, excess capacity already exists in a fishery with a fully utilized fish stock. Even where barriers to entry exist in a fishery, such as exclusive economic zones (EEZs), permit moratoriums, or transferable licenses, fishermen who participate in the fishery retain a market incentive to race for the fish since no property rights exist for the in situ marine resource; i. e., the fish-in-the-sea. While the adverse effects of excessive capacity levels have become too 2 obvious and severe to ignore, they can be corrected. With economically rational fisheries management, fishermen behave as if a private property right exists for the in situ marine resource. This creates a market incentive for fishermen to conserve the fish stock by divesting capital and other factor inputs needed to harvest fish until the yield from the fishery corresponds to MEY, the fish stock is conserved, and excess capacity in the fishery is eliminated. Achieving this objective <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of great debate. Without an unbiased and objective capacity measurement metric, {{the success or failure of}} regulations designed to reduce capacity cannot be accurately assessed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} sources of {{information}} that first year engineering students use to decide which engineering major to pursue for their undergraduate studies. The {{purposes of this study}} are twofold: (1) to understand how students make an informed decision of which engineering major to pursue and (2) to help the First Year Engineering (FYE) program administration improve the informational resources they provide the students. This study was framed within the FYE population of a large Midwestern university and was commissioned by the FYE program. FYE administration conducts regular student surveys for feedback and improvement purposes. We analyzed different survey data collected over a period of one year and found out that students identified “Self-Led Exploration of Engineering Disciplines” (SLE) as the single most important source of information in selecting <b>a</b> major. SLE <b>is</b> <b>a</b> broad, <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term,</b> which students may interpret differently. Hence, we developed a qualitative study to investigate how students perform SLE. We conducted individual interviews with 12 students enrolled in the FYE Program. These students were selected so that they were representative of the entire student population in terms of gender. The qualitative findings of this study reinforce that the students are basing their decision of a major using SLE. These findings also helped us unpack the meaning of SLE, and we further came up with 6 different types of SLE. Finally, our findings also indicated that direct interaction with people was highly valued by the students while selecting a major...|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{working hypothesis}} of Alzheimer's disease {{is that the}} proximate pathologic agents are oligomers of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ). "Oligomer" <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term.</b> Many different types of oligomers have been reported, and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and higher-order assemblies. This has made formal structure-activity determinations difficult. Recently, Ono et al. [Ono, K., et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106, 14745 - 14750] used rapid, zero-length, in situ chemical cross-linking to stabilize the oligomer state, allowing the isolation and study of pure populations of oligomers of a specific order (number of Aβ monomers per assembly). This approach was successful but highly laborious and time-consuming, precluding general application of the method. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a "continuous flow reactor" {{with the ability to}} produce theoretically unlimited quantities of chemically stabilized Aβ oligomers. We show, in addition to its utility for Aβ, that this method can be applied {{to a wide range of}} other amyloid-forming proteins. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Ethical Challenges of Big Data in Public Health ” by Vayena et al. is {{a timely}} paper for a num-ber of reasons, {{all of which}} are {{concisely}} embodied within the title. Ethical challenges are not something we consider often enough in this or most biomedical research journals. Yet, such challenges increasingly confront us as private citizens providing health data and as researchers using these data for public health and research purposes. Big data <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term,</b> yet there can be no denying that social media data (which are described in this article for use in digital disease detection [DDD]) cover a large and varied area, measured by both volume and velocity (rate of accumulation), and, as the authors de-scribe, have the potential for important public health uses, but also have risks. And that, as de-scribed, is only one potential use of these data; there are many other uses barely introduced by the authors. In short the appeal of such data is huge, but so are the risks. The authors do an ex-cellent job of characterizing the pluses and minuses of DDD. I encourage all of us to contem-plate this article and the implications it masterfully elucidates. The underlying message from Vayena et al. is clear: use of these data far outpaces the gover-nance and due diligence of the ethical considerations that need to be addressed. Quoting th...|$|E
40|$|The {{last twenty}} years have {{witnessed}} an important movement in the aspirations of public policy beyond meeting merely material goals towards a range of outcomes captured {{through the use of}} the term 'wellbeing'. Nonetheless, the concept of wellbeing <b>is</b> itself <b>ill-defined,</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> used in multiple different contexts with different meanings and policy implications. Bringing together a range of perspectives, this volume examines the intersections of wellbeing and place, including immediate applied policy concerns as well as more critical academic engagements.. Conceptualisations of place, context and settings have come under critical examination, and more nuanced and varied understandings are drawn out from both academic and policy-related research. Whilst quantitative and some policy approaches treat place as a static backdrop or context, others explore the interrelationships of emotional, social, cultural and experiential meanings that are both shape place and are shaped in place. Similarly, wellbeing may <b>be</b> understood as <b>a</b> relatively stable and measurable entity or as a more situation-dependent and relational effect. The book is structured into two sections: essays that explore the dynamics that determine wellbeing in relation to place and essays that explore contested understandings of wellbeing both empirically and theoretically...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{systematic}} inequalities {{in social and}} health outcomes has come to form part of contemporary policy discourse. This rhetoric is deployed {{even in the face}} of policy decisions widely viewed as iniquitous. Moreover, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> widespread view, expressed across the political spectrum, that those in more deprived circumstances are less likely than their more affluent counterparts to be in receipt of optimal public services. Such individuals and communities are variously described as excluded, disadvantaged, underserved or hard to reach. Across countries and policy domains the term ‘hard to reach’ is used to refer to those deemed not to be in optimal receipt of public sector services which are intended to increase some aspect of material, social or physical wellbeing. It is increasingly used in health policy documents which aim to address health inequalities. However, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>ill-defined</b> and contested <b>term.</b> The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, it offers a critical commentary on the concept of hard-to-reachness and asks: who are viewed as hard to reach and why? Second, using a case-study of a Scottish health improvement programme that explicitly aims to reach and engage the ‘hard to reach’ in preventive approaches to cardiovascular disease, it tests the policy and practice implications of the concept. It finds that a lack of conceptual clarity leads to ambiguous policy and practice and argues for possible theoretical refinements...|$|R
40|$|Immersion <b>is</b> <b>an</b> oft-quoted but <b>ill-defined</b> <b>term</b> used to {{describe}} a viewer or participant's sense of engagement with a visual display system or participatory media. Traditionally, advances in immersive quality came at {{the high price of}} ever-escalating hardware requirements and computational budgets. But what if one could increase a participant's sense of immersion, instead, by taking advantage of perceptual cues, neuroprocessing, and emotional engagement while adding only a small, yet distinctly targeted, set of advancements to the display hardware? This thesis describes three systems that introduce small amounts of computation to the visual display of information in order to increase the viewer's sense of immersion and participation. It also describes the types of content used to evaluate the systems, as well as the results and conclusions gained from small user studies. The first system, Infinity-by-Nine, takes advantage of the dropoff in peripheral visual acuity to surround the viewer with an extended lightfield generated in realtime from existing video content. The system analyzes an input video stream and outpaints a low-resolution, pattern-matched lightfield that simulates a fully immersive environment in a computationally efficient way. The second system, the Narratarium, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> context-aware projector that applies pattern recognition and natural language processing to an input such as an audio stream or electronic text to generate images, colors, and textures appropriate to the narrative or emotional content. The system outputs interactive illustrations and audio projected into spaces such as children's rooms, retail settings, or entertainment venues. The final system, the 3 D Telepresence Chair, combines a 19 th-century stage illusion known as Pepper's Ghost with an array of micro projectors and a holographic diffuser to create an autostereoscopic representation of a remote subject with full horizontal parallax.
