40|$|Novel {{processes}} for sterilization and <b>deodorization</b> of cork stoppers and cork barks {{have been developed}} and evaluated. Cork sterilization targets to microbial load reduction, either for bacteria or yeasts-moulds, while the reduction of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -Trichloroanisole (2, 4, 6 -TCA) of cork is achieved via their <b>deodorization.</b> The determination of microbial load and rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA οf cork {{was carried out by}} appropriate developed and evaluated analytical techniques, while the corks were subjected to artificial microbial or chemical contamination in many cases. The application of the plain ozonation process (ozone dosage= 1500 g?min/m 3) proved to be particularly efficient on microbial load removal of cork barks (98 %) and their 7 day preservation, without causing any remarkable degradation of cork quality characteristics. At once, three times higher ozone dosage (4500 g?min/m 3) resulted to a <b>deodorization</b> degree varied from 45 to 82 % and this variation is probably due to the local distribution of 2, 4, 6 -TCA in cork and to the restricted ozone access in cork internal structure. Despite the application of plain and pulsed steam processes, under the experimental conditions, resulted to lower sterilization efficacy of barks (76 %), showed comparable <b>deodorization</b> percentages (75 - 85 %) accompanied with lower remaining values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA. The steam pulsed process (SPP) was selected as the optimum process based on techno economical criteria, for the treatment of artificially contaminated cork stoppers, because during its application, a 99 % sterilization degree and a comparable <b>deodorization</b> efficacy was achieved, resulted to a rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA sufficiently lower to the acceptable quality limit of 5 ng/L. Ozone usage, showed once more its excellent sterilizing action, but its contribution to cork stopper <b>deodorization</b> seemed to be negligible. Consequently, taking into account the high cost required for ozone production, its use wasn’t desirable. During a more detailed insight of the optimum process SPP, naturally contaminated cork stoppers were tested and sporadic resistance phenomena to <b>deodorization</b> were observed probably due to thermal collapsing of cork cells and 2, 4, 6 -TCA content release from these cells. Based on a statistical analysis using Gamma distribution was demonstrated that SPP treatment of naturally contaminated cork stoppers contributed to an increase of the possibility to find an untainted cork stopper from a bale from 0, 54 to 0, 74. In the sequel, an appropriate mathematical model describing the <b>deodorization</b> of artificially and naturally contaminated cork stoppers was constructed and its critical parameters were determined by obtained experimental data simulation In the second part, the <b>deodorization</b> of cork stoppers through the liquid or gas phase, using commercially available adsorbents was studied. The majority of the tested materials showed significant adsorption capacity against 2, 4, 6 -TCA and Tygon was chosen for further study. The simultaneous presence of Tygon in cork aqueous extracts, during a time period of 16 h, conduced to values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 - TCA of cork stoppers significant lower than the limit of 5 ng/L, delimiting 97 % <b>deodorization,</b> while the 20 day residence of Tygon with artificially contaminated cork stoppers in an enclosed gas atmosphere was proved sufficient in order to achieve a 95 % <b>deodorization</b> degree. The estimated operational cost of the <b>deodorization</b> process with Tygon was 200 times lower than the corresponding cost of SPP. Finally, 2, 4, 6 -TCA management as a waste amount during cork <b>deodorization</b> processes in liquid or gas phase, was included the usage of oxidizing agents, as ozone and the photocatalytic degradation on titania film. The latter process resulted to faster and more efficient 2, 4, 6 -TCA reduction in gas phase (99 %), providing a potential solution. ...|$|E
