5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|Operation Stack is {{a traffic}} {{management}} {{system on the}} M20 through and near Ashford, which allows HGVs to queue for the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover when there is bad weather or industrial action. The scheme is controversial as <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> closing the entire eastbound motorway to through traffic. In 2013, Kent County Council sought funding to build a dedicated lorry park in Ashford.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins Hospital {{protocol}} for initiating the ketogenic diet {{has been widely}} adopted. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.

5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> absorbing {{the souls of}} enemies {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{meditation}} aims {{to heighten}} the personal relationship {{based on the}} love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches have emphasized the use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Discworld is a 1995 point-and-click {{adventure}} game {{developed by}} Teeny Weeny Games and Perfect 10 Productions for MS-DOS, Macintosh, and the Sony PlayStation. A Sega Saturn version was released the following year. The game stars Rincewind the Wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) and {{is set on}} Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The plot is based roughly around {{the events in the}} book Guards! Guards!, but also borrows elements from other Discworld novels. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> Rincewind attempting to stop a dragon terrorising the inhabitants of Ankh-Morpork.|$|E

5|$|Fordham's {{medical school}} officially closed in 1919, and its College of Pharmacy {{followed}} suit in 1972. Nevertheless, the university continues its tradition of medical education through a {{collaboration with the}} Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University. The partnership allows Fordham undergraduate and graduate science students to take classes, conduct research, and pursue early admission to select programs of Einstein. In addition, <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> a physician mentoring program, which permits students to shadow an attending physician at Einstein's Montefiore Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis {{are now trying to}} develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by splendid fairywren {{males have}} been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so {{named for the}} similarity of movements to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E
