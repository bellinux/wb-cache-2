40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether weekday of esophagectomy impacts 30 -day mortality, and short- and long-term oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent literature suggests a relationship between the weekday of esophagectomy and overall survival. This finding could impact clinical practice, but has not yet been validated in other studies. METHODS: The Netherlands Cancer Registry database (2005 - 2013) identified all patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The impact of weekday on 30 -day mortality, the total number of resected lymph nodes, and R 0 resection rates was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression analyses and for overall survival with Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: In total, 3840 patients were included. Weekday was not significantly associated with 30 -day mortality (P > 0. 05), nor the total number of resected lymph nodes (P > 0. 05), nor with R 0 resection rates (P > 0. 05). Also, weekday did not significantly influence overall survival using weekday as discrete variable [Monday-Friday, hazard ratio (HR) 0. 98, P = 0. 140), as 2 weekday categories (Wednesday-Friday vs Monday-Tuesday, HR 0. 97, P = 0. 434), or with separate weekday categories (Tuesday vs Monday, HR 0. 99, P = 0. 826; Wednesday vs Monday, HR 1. 06, P = 0. 430; Thursday vs Monday, HR 0. 92, P = 0. 206; <b>Friday</b> <b>vs</b> Monday, HR 0. 91, P = 0. 140). CONCLUSIONS: This large population-based cohort study in the Netherlands refutes the finding from a previous report that suggests that the weekday of esophagectomy in patients diagnosed with potentially curable esophageal cancer impacts overall survival. In addition, this study demonstrates that weekday of esophagectomy does not influence other outcomes including the 30 -day mortality, total number of resected lymph nodes, and R 0 resection rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test human capital theory via the earnings announcements through the returns within the for-profit education and training services industry. This theory posits that enrollment levels would rise during recessionary periods and this should be reflected in better earnings announcements of the education firms. Data was retrieved from the Compustat, CRSP, Thompson IBES, Google Finance, and Yahoo! Finance databases spanning the recessionary years of 2008 through 2010. The first hypothesis utilized a price index weighted by the education firms 2 ̆ 7 market capitalization and the Russell 3000 Index as a proxy for the market to assess the daily returns of the education industry relative to the market. The second and third hypotheses involved assessing the quality of the earnings announcements within the education industry on a <b>Friday</b> <b>vs.</b> non-Friday report basis. The fourth hypothesis explored the actual EPS vs. forecasted EPS in consecutive quarters to test for differences in the earnings of that are better-than and those that are the same-or-worse than expected. The final hypothesis utilized the cumulative abnormal returns and cumulative excessive returns methodologies to compare the performance of the periods before and after the announcements. No support for the first four hypotheses was found. Consistent with expectations established by other research using CAR and CER methodologies, the fifth hypothesis was supported. Support for human capital theory was not found because four hypotheses were unsupported. This study was limited to U. S. education firms that were publicly traded on major U. S. exchanges. No private for-profit or non-profit firms were included in this study. Knowledge was gained by exploring the earnings announcements of the education industry for evidence of human capital theory. The absence of support for the theory within the industry during a recession could be an indicator of other issues affecting the industry that need to be researched further before any conclusions can be reached. This study extends the research in earnings announcements by examining the relationship the education industry has with the market. It also contributes to the work in human capital theory by testing the education industry 2 ̆ 7 s performance during recessionary years...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In British Columbia (BC), the Ministry of Human Resources issues welfare cheques to {{eligible}} recipients monthly on {{the last}} Wednesday of each month. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} there are significant increases in hospital admission, ED admission, 911 calls and deaths shortly after the distribution of the monthly welfare cheques. The objective of this analysis was to rigorously examine the impact of welfare cheque issue dates on admission to the Sobering Unit (SU), a service for the publicly intoxicated, in Vancouver, Canada. Data on 1234 consecutive admissions to the SU over a 7 -month period were assessed, and the average number of daily admissions on each of the 7 days of the welfare cheque issue week and similar weekdays in other weeks were compared. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed for the comparisons. Our results showed that there were significant increases in the number of admissions on the 3 days starting with "Welfare Wednesday" compared to the similar weekdays in other weeks (Welfare Wednesday vs. other Wednesdays: 8. 7 vs. 5. 1, p = 0. 02; Welfare Thursdays vs. other Thursdays: 9. 6 vs. 5. 3, p = 0. 02; Welfare <b>Fridays</b> <b>vs.</b> other Fridays: 8. 6 vs. 5. 7, p = 0. 04). The demonstrated impact of welfare cheque issue dates is an important consideration for the re-design, staffing and resource allocation of services for withdrawal management and potentially for other services offered to this population. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{response}} rates to physician postal surveys remain modest. The primary {{objective of this}} study was to assess the effect of tracking responses on physician survey response rate (i. e., determining whether each potential participant has responded or not). A secondary objective was to assess the effects of day of mailing (Monday <b>vs.</b> <b>Friday)</b> on physician survey response rate. METHODS: We conducted 3 randomized controlled trials. The first 2 trials had a 2 x 2 factorial design and tested the effect of day of mailing (Monday <b>vs.</b> <b>Friday)</b> and of tracking vs. no tracking responses. The third trial tested the effect of day of mailing (Monday <b>vs.</b> <b>Friday).</b> We meta-analyzed these 3 trials using a random effects model. RESULTS: The total number of participants in the 3 trials was 1339. The response rate with tracked mailing was not statistically different from that with non-tracked mailing by the time of the first reminder (RR =  1. 01 95 % CI 0. 84, 1. 22; I²  =   0 %). There was a trend towards lower response rate with tracked mailing by the time of the second reminder (RR =  0. 91; 95 % CI 0. 78, 1. 06; I²  =   0 %). The response rate with mailing on Mondays was not statistically different from that with Friday mailing by the time of first reminder (RR =  1. 01; 95 % CI 0. 87, 1. 17; I²  =   0 %), and by the time of the 2 (nd) reminder (RR =  1. 08; 95 % CI 0. 84, 1. 39; I²  =   77 %). CONCLUSIONS: Tracking response may negatively affect physicians' response rate. The day of mailing does not appear to affect physicians' response rate...|$|R

40|$|Accents and Focus Particles Draw Attachment Joe Castle 2 ̆ 6 Dr. Katy Carlson, English Department There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that pitch accents can affect syntactic attachment in ambiguous sentences (Schafer et al. 1996; Lee 2 ̆ 6 Watson 2011; Carlson 2 ̆ 6 Tyler 2015). One {{explanation is that}} the focus status of the accented word makes it important to the main sentence assertion and thus draws attachment (Schafer et al. 1996). Our experiment therefore tested whether other means of focusing words, such as the focus particle only, could also affect attachment. In the experiment, 20 sentences (e. g., Susie (only) learned that Bill (only) arrived # on Friday) had the focus particle only before V 1 (learned) or V 2 (arrived); two further conditions also accented the verb with the particle. Participants (N= 52) chose between paraphrases showing V 1 or V 2 attachment of the final adverbial phrase, on Friday (either Susie learned something on Friday or Bill arrived on <b>Friday).</b> Only on <b>V</b> 1 led to over 60...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s (decade), the Athletic Band {{directing}} staff, {{as well as}} the Athletic Department, realized the wild popularity of the Script Ohio. Having been performed at professional football games, a World Series game, and {{on the deck of the}} USS Enterprise, the Athletic Dept wanted to bring this longstanding tradition to new audiences, and asked the Band Staff if it would be possible to create a Script Ohio on an ice rink. The directing staff decided to try it, and an instant hit was created. Members of the Athletic Band put on ice cleats strapped march on the ice between periods of Men's Hockey games, typically a <b>Friday</b> night OSU <b>vs.</b> Michigan or Michigan State hockey game. Because of the dangers of marching on ice, the Script on Ice was highly modified from the Marching Band's counterpart. The full Athletic Band, led by one of the Marching Band's Drum Majors, marches out onto the ice through the visiting team tunnel, at a tempo much slower than the Marching Band's 180 beats per minute. The band turns and faces the home and visitor sides of the arena, playing Buckeye Battle Cry. After a drum roll-off, the band begins playing a shortened version of Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse. Every 32 counts, a section of the block band breaks formation and marches into the shape of the letters in the trademark Script Ohio.|$|R
40|$|Scenes, {{created and}} defined by {{particular}} social settings offer a central activity {{that help to}} focus community interaction, {{a sense of purpose}} and of being in the right place. This dissertation is about the grassroots development of an art scene in the most unlikely of places – Las Vegas, a city sociologists have often described as having an isolating character with an outward focus on tourism, a weak civic culture and social fragmentation, resulting in an individually-focused and socially isolated population. Using the multiple techniques of ethnographic research, this work comes out of: (1) conversations with early visionaries, (2) participant observation and (3) a wide assortment of secondary data, both local and national. My ethnographic account of the development of the Las Vegas art scene highlights the efforts of early visionaries, internal conflicts over its design and implementation (gallery walk or festive block party) of the monthly city-wide First Friday event and activities within the Arts District, the impact of a corporate revitalization of the Entertainment District in the old downtown area (Downtown Project), and the sudden purchase of the non-profit First Friday trademark by the managing conglomerate connected to the Downtown Project. This study has four key findings. First, I found support for the idea that the Las Vegas art scene can be interpreted {{as a response to the}} isolating, and individualizing character of Las Vegas. With a monthly gathering of massive crowds within the 18 blocks of the Arts District, also called the “ 18 b,” First Friday has become a type of temporary community focused upon an organized focal experience for a wide variety of artistic styles through authenticating cultural and aesthetic activities and experiences. Second, the burgeoning arts culture of Las Vegas has formed a loosely organized social world for participants to share meaning and interests and at times conflict, such as the polarization around a long standing internal conflict regarding the implementation of First <b>Friday</b> (arts walk <b>vs.</b> street festival). Third, the Las Vegas arts community is an important repository for social capital, especially if more social venues are developed where friends 2 ̆ 2 and acquaintances can meet, talk and relax (Oldenberg 2001). At the same time, while third places, such as The Arts Factory or The Funk House will be necessary to maintaining the 18 b, it is unclear if the Arts Distinct, in and of itself can ever become a ‘big third place” (Borer 2008) like that of the Entertainment District in old downtown. As long as resources are directed primarily to the Downtown Project and the downtown area is marketed as a “to be seen” tourist destination, the 18 b will not rise to the level of a city-wide destination. Fourth, the promotion of Las Vegas as a center for the arts is premised on the idea that the commodification of art has the power to engage and transform [cities]. However any “meaning” construed from the consumption of art must depend upon the life history and/or experience of the consumer, and while art has a strong influence on those who create art and for some who see it, art also marks hierarchies and social distancing. Art (gallery, public street murals etc.) alone, however, cannot change the economic climate when those without social capital have to live at a basic survival level...|$|R
