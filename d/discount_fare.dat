40|$|We {{examine a}} seat {{allocation}} game between two airlines for flights with two fares with dependent random demands. The strategic variable {{of this game}} is each airline’s booking limit for the low fare. We have shown that there exists an equilibrium booking strategy such that both airlines will protect {{the same number of}} seats for the full fare and the total number of seats available for the <b>discount</b> <b>fare</b> under competition is smaller than the total number of seats that would be available if the two airlines collude. A numerical example is used to illustrate the equilibrium solutions and to examine the impact of the capacity shares and the level of dependency between random demands...|$|E
40|$|Every morning, commuters {{select the}} {{regularly}} dispatched urban mass transit for traveling from a residential area to a workplace. This paper aims {{to find an}} optimal <b>discount</b> <b>fare</b> and time intervals on morning peak hour. As a direct and flexible traffic economic instrument, fares can influence commuters’ behavior. Therefore, fare discount has been proposed to regulate traffic flow in different time. Two models have been analyzed to describe it with schedule delay because of the travel demand size. The first objective function is constructed on pressure equalization when the travel demand is small. The other objective function is to minimize total waiting time when the travel demand is large. In the end, numerical examples based on an artificial network are performed to characterize fare discount models...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an airline}} overbooking {{problem of a}} new single-leg flight with <b>discount</b> <b>fare.</b> Due {{to the absence of}} historical data of no-shows for a new flight, and various uncertain human behaviors or unexpected events which causes that a few passengers cannot board their aircraft on time, we fail to obtain the probability distribution of no-shows. In this case, the airlines have to invite some domain experts to provide belief degree of no-shows to estimate its distribution. However, human beings often overestimate unlikely events, which makes the variance of belief degree much greater than that of the frequency. If we still regard the belief degree as a subjective probability, the derived results will exceed our expectations. In order to deal with this uncertainty, the number of no-shows of new flight is assumed to be an uncertain variable in this paper. Given the chance constraint of social reputation, an overbooking model with discount fares is developed to maximize the profit rate based on uncertain programming theory. Finally, the analytic expression of the optimal booking limit is obtained through a numerical example, and the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the optimal booking limit is affected by flight capacity, discount, confidence level, and parameters of the uncertainty distribution significantly...|$|E
