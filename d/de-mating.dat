40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design guide is to present {{information}} for understanding and mitigating the potential hazards associated with <b>de-mating</b> and mating powered electrical connectors on space flight vehicles. The process of staging is a necessary function in the launching of space vehicles and in the deployment of satellites, and now in manned assembly of systems in space. During this electrical interconnection process, various environments may be encountered that warrant the restriction of the voltage and current present across the pins of an electrical connector prior to separation, mating, or in a static open non-mated configuration. This process is called deadfacing. These potentially hazardous environments encompass the obvious explosive fuel vapors and human shock hazard, to multiple Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) phenomena related to the rapid rate of change in current as well as exposure to Radio Frequency (RF) fields...|$|E
40|$|Exploitation {{of space}} must {{benefit from the}} latest {{advances}} in robotics. On-orbit servicing is a clear candidate {{for the application of}} autonomous rendezvous and docking mechanisms. However, during the last three decades most of the trials took place combining extravehicular activities (EVAs) with telemanipulated robotic arms. The European Space Agency (ESA) considers that grasping and refuelling are promising near-mid-term capabilities that could be performed by servicing spacecraft. Minimal add-ons on spacecraft to enhance their serviceability may protect them for a changing future in which satellite servicing may become mainstream. ESA aims to conceive and promote standard refuelling provisions that can be installed in present and future European commercial geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite platforms and scientific spacecraft. For this purpose ESA has started the ASSIST activity addressing the analysis, design and validation of internal provisions (such as modifications to fuel, gas, electrical and data architecture to allow servicing) and external provisions (such as integrated berthing fixtures with peripheral electrical, gas, liquid connectors, leak check systems and corresponding optical and radio markers for cooperative rendezvous and docking). This refuelling approach is being agreed with European industry (OHB, Thales Alenia Space) and expected to be consolidated with European commercial operators as a first step to become an international standard; this approach is also being considered for on-orbit servicing spacecraft, such as the SpaceTug, by Airbus DS. This paper describes in detail the operational means, structure, geometry and accommodation of the system. Internal and external provisions will be designed with the minimum possible impact on the current architecture of GEO satellites without introducing additional risks in the development and commissioning of the satellite. Endeffector and berthing fixtures are being designed in the range of few kilos and linear dimensions around 15 cm. A central mechanical part is expected to perform first a soft docking followed by a motorized retraction ending during a hard docking phase using aligning pins. Mating and <b>de-mating</b> will be exhaustively analysed to ensure robustness of operations. Leakage-free valves would allow for the transfer of fuel to the serviced spacecraft. The validation of the ASSIST system through dedicated environmental tests in a vacuum chamber together with dynamic testing using an air-bearing table will allow for the demonstration of concept feasibility and its suitability for becoming a standard of the on-orbit space industry...|$|E

At least one socket is enclosed within the receptacle unit and is aligned {{with at least}} one permeable membrane disposed in {{the front end of the}} receptacle unit. The plug unit includes a body slidably mounted within a longitudinal bore therein. At least one pin extends from the front end of the body and is aligned {{with at least one}} permeable membrane disposed in the front end of the plug unit. The plug unit is biased toward a first, <b>de-mate</b> position in which the body is extended rearwardly such that the pin is enclosed with the plug unit and is slidable to a second, mate position in which the body is compressed forwardly such that the pin projects through the permeable membranes of the plug and receptacle units to electrically connect with the socket...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to develop connectors (quick disconnects and umbilical systems) that can be repetitively and reliably mated and <b>de-mated</b> during Lunar surface extra-vehicular activities. These standardized interfaces will be required for structural integrity and commodities transfer between linked surface elements. QD's fittings are needed for EVA spacesuit Primary Life Support Systems as well as liquid cooled garment circulation and suit heat rejection. Umbilical electro-mechanical systems (connectors) are needed between discrete surface systems for transfer of air, power, fluid (water), and data must be capable of being operated by extra vehicular astronaut crew members and/or robotic assistants. There exists an urgent need to prevent electro-statically charged dust and debris from clogging and degrading the interface seals and causing leakage and spills of hazardous commodities, contaminating the flowstream, and degrading the mechanisms needed for umbilical connection. Other challenges include modularity, standardization, autonomous operation, and lifetime sealing issues...|$|R
40|$|Located at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, the Six-Degree-of-Freedom Dynamic Test System (SDTS) is a real-time, six degree-of-freedom, {{short range}} motion base {{simulator}} {{originally designed to}} simulate the relative dynamics of two bodies in space mating together (i. e., docking or berthing). The SDTS has the capability to test full scale docking and berthing systems utilizing a two body dynamic docking simulation for docking operations and a Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) simulation for berthing operations. The SDTS {{can also be used}} for nonmating applications such as sensors and instruments evaluations requiring proximity or short range motion operations. The motion base is a hydraulic powered Stewart platform, capable of supporting a 3, 500 lb payload with a positional accuracy of 0. 03 inches. The SDTS is currently being used for the NASA Docking System testing and has been also used by other government agencies. The SDTS is also under consideration for use by commercial companies. Examples of tests include the verification of on-orbit robotic inspection systems, space vehicle assembly procedures and docking/berthing systems. The facility integrates a dynamic simulation of on-orbit spacecraft mating or <b>de-mating</b> using flight-like mechanical interface hardware. A force moment sensor is used for input during the contact phase, thus simulating the contact dynamics. While the verification of flight hardware presents unique challenges, one particular area of interest involves the use of external measurement systems to ensure accurate feedback of dynamic contact. The measurement systems for the test facility have two separate functions. The first is to take static measurements of facility and test hardware to determine both the static and moving frames used in the simulation and control system. The test hardware must be measured after each configuration change to determine both sets of reference frames. The second function is to take dynamic measurements during hardware motion and contact. While performing dynamic testing of an active docking system, researchers found that the data from the motion platform, test hardware and two external measurement systems exhibited frame offsets and rotational errors. While the errors were relatively small when considering the motion scale overall, they substantially exceeded the individual accuracies for each component. After evaluating both the static and dynamic measurements, researchers found that the static measurements introduced significantly more error into the system than the dynamic measurements even though, in theory, the static measurement errors should be smaller than the dynamic. In several cases, the magnitude of the errors varied widely for the static measurements. Upon further investigation, researchers found the larger errors to be a consequence of hardware alignment issues, frame location and measurement technique whereas the smaller errors were dependent on the number of measurement points. This paper details and quantifies the individual and cumulative errors of the docking system and describes methods for reducing the overall measurement error. The overall quality of the dynamic docking tests for flight hardware verification was improved by implementing these error reductions...|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} of supercomputers, routers, and switches are envisioned to have hundreds and thousands of optical interconnects among components. An optical interconnect attains a bandwidth-distance product as high as 90 GHz. km, about 200 times higher than can be attained by a copper interconnect. But defects (such as dust or scratches) as small as 1 micron on the connector endfaces can seriously degrade performance. Therefore, for every mate and <b>de-mate,</b> optical connectors must be inspected to ensure high performance data transmission capabilities. The tedious and time consuming task of manually inspecting each connector {{is one of the}} barriers to adoption of optics in the backplanes of large card-based machines. This thesis provides a framework and method for in-situ automatic inspection of backplane optical connectors. We develop an inspection system that fits into the envelope of a single daughter card, moves a custom microscope objective in three degrees of freedom to image the connector endfaces, and detects and classifies defects with major diameter of one micron or larger. The inspection machine mounts to the backplane {{in the same manner as}} a daughter card, and positions the microscope with better than 0. 2 micron resolution and 15 micron repeatability in three degrees of freedom. Despite tight packaging constraints, the ultra-long working distance custom microscope objective attains 1 micron Rayleigh resolution via deconvolution. Several images taken at different exposures and focus settings are fused to extend the imaging sensor's limited dynamic range and depth of field. A set of machine-vision algorithms are developed to process the resulting image and detect and classify the fiber core, cladding and their defects. by Andrew K. Wilson. Thesis (Ph. D.)
