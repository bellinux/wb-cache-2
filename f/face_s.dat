A strictly analogous, but different fact, may be observed at the Maldiva atolls--namely, that where two atolls {{stand in front of}} each other, the breaches in the reef are the most numerous on their near, and therefore less exposed, sides. Thus on the near sides of Ari and the two Nillandoo atolls, which <b>face</b> <b>S.</b> Male, Phaleedoo, and Moloque atolls, there are seventy-three deep-water channels, and only twenty-five on their outer sides; on the near side of the three latter named atolls there are fifty- six openings, and only thirty-seven on their outsides. It is scarcely possible to attribute this difference to any other cause than the somewhat different action of the sea on the two sides, which would ensue from the protection afforded by the two rows of atolls to each other. I may here remark that in most cases, the conditions favourable to the greater accumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect continuity {{on one side of the}} atoll than on the other, have concurred, but this has not been the case with the Maldivas; for we have seen that the islets are placed on the eastern or south-eastern sides, whilst the breaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side, where protected by an opposite atoll. The reef being more continuous on the outer and more exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each other, accords with the fact, that the reef of the southern atolls is more continuous than that of the northern ones; for the former, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, are more constantly exposed than the northern atolls to a heavy surf.|$|E

The myocytes were stimulated (Si pulse) to produce an action potential. Then a constant-field shock (S 2 pulse) with an electric field of 20 or 40 V/cm was given at an S 1 -S 2 interval of 50 msec. The cells were stained with potentiometric dye (di- 4 -ANEPPS), and the cell end <b>facing</b> the <b>S</b> 2 anode or cathode was illuminated with a laser while the fluorescence was recorded. During S 2, the cell end <b>facing</b> the <b>S</b> 2 cathode became more positive intracellu-larly, whereas the cell end <b>facing</b> the <b>S</b> 2 anode became more negative intracellularly. The S 2 -induced transmembrane potential change at the cell end (AVm) was determined relative to the amplitude of the Si-induced action potential (APA) in each recording (i. e., AVm/APA). In Tyrode's solution containing 4. 5 mM potassium, AVm/APA for 40 -V/cm S 2 was 1. 36 + 0. 34 at the cell end <b>facing</b> the <b>S</b> 2 cathode and- 1. 65 + 0. 61 at the cell end <b>facing</b> the <b>S</b> 2 anode (n= 9).

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} we are {{interested}} in the relationship between a transitive and antisymmetric notion of preference given in RP by a dominance structure and the notion of face of a set whether convex or not. No particular type of mappings with values in that space is considered. We first study the case where the dominance structure is given by a constant cone Λ. We show that the bounded <b>faces</b> of <b>S</b> + Λ are contained in the set Ext[S¦Λ] of Λ-extreme points of S for every S∩Rp and, then, assuming S is Λ-convex we prove that Ext[S| Λ) ] is a union of <b>faces</b> of <b>S</b> + Λ. This result is improved by setting very wide conditions which ensure that Ext[S¦Λ] is the union of the bounded <b>faces</b> of <b>S</b> + Λ. Thus, the cumbersome question of dominance or nondominance of a <b>face</b> of <b>S</b> can be simplified under these conditions.

40|$|Background. The main {{question}} of the present research was born from the intersection between two issues: the relevant feature behind our sense of facial beauty and two kinds of information carried within different spatial frequency channels. Given its strong ability in communicating important information, facial beauty has gradually gained researchers attention. On the other side, given its importance in carrying significant information about the world we see, the spatial frequency of images –namely the different spatial bands– has been widely investigated in neuroscience. Objectives. Assumed that lower spatial frequencies carry information about the global feature of a picture, while higher spatial frequencies provide local characteristics, the present research aims at studying which band of the spatial frequency carries the most useful information when a judgement on beauty of two same-sex faces is required. Using eye tracking methods, the most relevant AOIs of faces are investigated in order to reveal which regions are the most attended when people evaluate someone else s beauty. Methods. Fifty participants performed a two-alternative forced choice task where they had to decide which between pairs of female and male same-sex faces they found more attractive in filtered and broadband conditions. Eye tracking data revealed which AOIs of the face are most attended during beauty judgements and pupil dilations were collected {{in order to measure}} real time effort. Results. Analyses of behavioral and eye tracking data revealed a difference between evaluations of attractiveness of female and male faces. Pupillometry data revealed a difference in pupil sizes in correspondence to each spatial frequency condition. Conclusion. Results revealed that neither very low nor very high spatial frequencies carry sufficiently useful information to perform judgements on faces beauty, compared to medium-level ones. Furthermore, both behavioral and eye tracking data show that people tend to evaluate differently female and male faces: it seems that while global information, carried by the lower spatial frequencies, is sufficient for evaluating a male <b>face</b> <b>s</b> beauty, local information provided by higher spatial frequencies are needed in order to perform effective judgements of a female <b>face</b> <b>s</b> attractiveness...|$|E

We also give a new necessary and sufficient condition for a finite face of G to be forcing in terms of bridges in the Z-transformation graph Z(G) of G.

Participants were adapted to <b>faces</b> (<b>S</b> 1 s) varying systematically on a morphing continuum between pairs of famous identities (identities A and B), or to Fourier phase-randomized faces, and had to match the subsequently presented ambiguous <b>faces</b> (<b>S</b> 2 s; 50 / 50 % identity A/B) to one of the respective original faces. We found that S 1 s identical with or near to the original identities led to strong contrastive biases with more identity B responses following A adaptation and vice versa. In addition, the closer S 1 s were to the 50 / 50 % S 2 on the morphing continuum, the smaller the magnitude of the AE was. The relation between S 1 s and AE was, however, not linear. Additionally, stronger AEs were accompanied by faster reaction times. Analyses of the simultaneously recorded ERPs revealed categorical adaptation effects starting at 100 ms post-stimulus onset, that were most pronounced at around 125 – 240 ms for occipito-temporal sites over both hemispheres.
