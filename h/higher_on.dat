5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults.

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the spine.

In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Estelle was {{the first}} major {{hurricane}} of the above-average 1986 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression formed well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula on July 16, and strengthened into a tropical storm within 24 hours. Located within a favorable environment, Estelle intensified into a hurricane on July 18. It attained major hurricane status (Category 3 intensity or <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) two days later. After peaking in intensity at Category 4 strength, Estelle slowly weakened. By July 24, Estelle was no longer a hurricane while passing south of Hawaii. It completely dissipated on July 26 after further deteriorating to a tropical depression. The arrival of the hurricane prompted a hurricane watch for Hawaii, and 200 people evacuated from their homes. Hurricane Estelle produced high waves offshore Hawaii, causing $2 million in damage and two deaths. The remnants of the storm also produced intermittent showers across the state, though there was no major damage.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E

40|$|Whether or {{not close}} {{emotional}} relationships {{with parents and}} peers serve similar functions for adolescent adjustment {{is an issue of}} increasing interest. The present study was designed to examine the relations between parent and peer attachment and adolescent adjustment. Eighty-nine adolescents (M age = 16. 1 years, SD = 1. 8 years) completed self-report measures of parent and peer attachment, sympathy, academic efficacy, aggression, anxiety, and depression.

Discriminant function analyses revealed that the groups differed only along one dimension, suggesting that parent and peer attachment served similar functions in terms of the adjustment indices measured. Adolescents <b>high</b> <b>on</b> both peer and parent attachment were the best adjusted (i. e., least aggressive and depressed, most sympathetic) and those low on both were the least well adjusted. Furthermore, those <b>high</b> <b>on</b> peer but low on parent attachment were better adjusted than those <b>high</b> <b>on</b> parent but low on peer attachment, suggesting that peer attachment may be relatively more influential on adolescent adjustment than parent attachment...|$|R
