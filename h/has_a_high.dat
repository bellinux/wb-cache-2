5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E

5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E

40|$|CgSS 2010 (家户卷) 调查数据表明,相对于男性,客观社会经济地位明显弱势的农村妇女,在主观上倾向于做出更高的阶层认同。本文探讨了农村妇女的阶层认同之特征和影响因素。通过AnOVA分析和多元回归分析,文章发现,性别是影响农村阶层认同的重要因素,其中,农村妇女的阶层认同来源于配偶和自身社会经济地位的共同影响,社会经济地位代际传递的影响不显著。总体来看,个人或配偶具有高收入、配偶属于共产党员、从事非农职业劳动和养育子女(尤其儿子) 等条件下的农村妇女更可能做出较高的阶层认同。The 2010 CGSS(Household) {{survey data}} indicates,although {{compared}} with men,rural women usually be {{in a more}} disadvantageous social status,they tend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> class identity. Based on the ANOVA analysis and multiple regression analysis,this paper explores the influencing factors of rural women's class identity,and figures out that gender {{is one of the}} key influential factors. Rural women's class identity is influenced by both the social status of their own and that of their spouses'. Furthermore,the intergenerational transmission is not significant. If the rural women or their spouses <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> income or <b>a</b> membership of CCP,they are more likely to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> class identity.
