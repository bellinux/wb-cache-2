5|$|Highly {{regarded}} {{during her}} active {{career as a}} portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries—three in Australia and one in South Africa—a record {{for a woman who}} was an Australian painter at that time. In 1927 she began almost twenty years of institutionalization in a mental asylum, however, and her death went without notice. After her death, information about her was frequently omitted from reference books about Australian painters and knowledge of her work became obscure despite her paintings being held in public art collections including the Art <b>Gallery</b> <b>of</b> South Australia, the Art <b>Gallery</b> <b>of</b> Western Australia, the National <b>Gallery</b> <b>of</b> Australia, the National <b>Gallery</b> <b>of</b> Victoria, the Art <b>Gallery</b> <b>of</b> New South Wales and Australia's National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
