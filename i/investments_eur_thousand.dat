40|$|The {{rising trend}} in the {{prevalence}} of obesity {{has become a major}} public health concern in many countries during the past decades, partly because being obese is associated with comorbidities and death. The cost of treatment for obesity related diseases has become a heavy burden on the national health care budget in many countries. The treatment options for obesity are mainly weight management therapies in the form of diet and exercise, pharmacological therapy, and surgery. The incidence of bariatric surgery in Sweden has increased eight-fold in the last decade. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass surgical treatments for obesity in adult patients, in comparison with conventional treatment, in Sweden from a societal perspective. The conventional treatment alternative consisted of the prevalent mixture of non-surgical obesity treatments. A model of individual patients was used to simulate the outcomes of the patients in terms of treatment costs, indirect costs, life years, and quality adjusted life years (QALY) over a lifetime perspective. In patients with a Body Mass Index of 40 - 44 kg/m 2, surgery was estimated to be cost-saving in men and judged cost-effective in women, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of SEK 26 <b>thousand</b> (<b>EUR</b> 3 <b>thousand).</b> The incremental cost associated with gastric bypass decreases with BMI, increases with the patient's age, and is higher in women than in men. Taking patient characteristics and uncertainty in input data and model design into account, the incremental cost is estimated to be at most SEK 160 thousand per QALY gained (about <b>EUR</b> 18 <b>thousand</b> per QALY). In conclusion, gastric bypass surgery appears to be a cost-effective intervention compared to conventional treatment in adult persons with obesity in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Prescribing {{errors are}} {{a major cause of}} {{iatrogenic}} patient morbidity and therefore interventions aimed at preventing the adverse outcomes of these errors are likely to result in cost reduction. However, it is unclear whether the costs associated with these preventive measures are outweighed by the cost reductions (benefits). Therefore, a study was set up to analyse costs and benefits of detecting prescribing errors by hospital pharmacy staff. Design: During 5 consecutive days in two Dutch hospitals in February 2000 all medication orders, in which prescribing errors were detected, were analysed. A cost-benefit analysis was performed, based on direct medical costs only. The benefit-to-cost ratio was calculated by taking into account the net time hospital pharmacy staff needed for the prevention of the error (this included potential time saving for nursing staff, when an error was prevented by hospital pharmacy staff instead of nursing staff), as well as taking into account the possible consequences of the prescribing error (were the error not prevented). Results: A total of 3540 orders, of which 351 contained prescribing errors (9. 9 %), were analysed. During the 1 -week period investigated, time-investment of the pharmacy staff had net costs of EUR 285 (2000 values). During the same period estimated benefits related to this <b>investment</b> were <b>EUR</b> 9867. The finding of higher benefits than costs was robust in sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: From this study it can be concluded that prevention of prescribing errors by hospital pharmacy staff results in higher benefits than the costs related to the net time investment...|$|R

Our hypothesis is that a potential pension reform would have a positive significant impact on property investment volumes via institutions constituting the second pillar. In the first step, we provide analysis of pension reforms recently applied in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Given analysis of selected countries and specifics of the proposed Czech pension reform, we estimate that the institutions in the second pillar may face additional yearly cash inflows beginning on EUR 1. 23 billion in 2013 and further increasing to EUR 2. 59 billion in 2017. Furthermore, we estimate that a likely share allocation by second pillar institutions into real estate would lie in the region of 0 - 14 % depending on the discrete decision of the regulators. Using a conservative leverage of 40 % for bank financing, we estimate that the expected investment volumes allocated by second pillar institutions into real estate would be EUR 61 - 287 million in year 2013.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of building UL FGG at Hajdrihova ulica 28 has been analysed. Two examinations with a thermal camera were performed. The thermograms revealed {{failures in the}} structure {{that could not be}} noticed visually before. The walls’ structure was obtained from the project description from year 1955. In order to check the walls’ actual composition, the heat flux was measured with a thermocouple at four characteristic points of the building envelope. Thermal transmittance was calculated from the measured heat flux and compared with the thermal transmittance gained through the estimated thicknesses and physical properties of the walls’ layers. For the longitudinal thermal bridges, longitudinal thermal transmittance was calculated with a computer program THERM. The outer and inner dimensions of the building were acquired with a laser measurement. With the program Gradbena fizika URSA 4. 0, an energy performance certificate was prepared and the results were compared with the results from the energy performance certificate that already existed for the building. Taking into account that the building belongs to cultural heritage, measures for energysaving renovation were proposed, which would reduce heath losses and increase energy efficiency. In addition, measures were proposed for the use of renewable energy resources that would provide the energy required for the functioning of the building. The costs for the proposed measures were estimated. The most efficient and also the most required measure is the thermal insulation of the ceiling toward unheated attic, which was estimated to be 20 <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR.</b> The <b>investment</b> would be repaid in 4 years time...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified social cost-benefit analysis approach tested on around thirty projects of small infrastructure in Croatia, and deals {{with some of}} the specific issues encountered in this field work. In Zadar and Sibenik– Knin counties, Croatia, a Sustainable Development Project funded by CARDS -Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation- was active from 2003 to 2006 for the war-affected areas. The project aimed to support the two administrations in managing local development programs through CARDS and to prepare for the pre-accession Funds. The assistance consisted in training in EU procedures, preparing grant scheme, updating the Regional Operational Program, implementing an infrastructure project pipeline. The paper focuses on the last activity, more precisely on the project appraisal for the preparation of the pipeline, and describes the experience developed in this context through a methodology commonly used for the management and evaluation of infrastructures funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds. The methodology applied for the evaluation was social cost-benefit analysis. The challenge of this experience is represented by the reference context, where either Public Administration than local actors started only recently to cope with the EU program procedures and principles, and by the chosen operative methods, made of a cooperation of International experts and professional evaluators with local personnel. Given the financial dimension of the concerned projects (from a few hundred <b>thousands</b> <b>EUR</b> to a maximum of five millions EUR, with one exception) a simplified yet rigorous version of the standard methodology has been applied. For the data collection the input came from the contribution of local actors, either the personnel of the company appointed for the management of this program than the Public Administration and the projects promoters. Surveys, personal interviews through well-structured questionnaires, printouts' desk analysis and presentation of the main results were the activities of the involved personnel. The application of a standard methodology allows a certain degree of comparability among the projects and makes it easy to horizontally read the interventions' performance. The message of the paper is that even for small infrastructure projects CBA is a tool by means of which project analysts and decision-makers could have a useful dialogue for the planning exercise.

40|$|Commercial airliners have {{continually}} voiced {{the need}} to improve the availability of their fleet and with current financial pressures facing many airlines this need has even become more significant. SHM can contribute to enhancing aircraft availability through substituting routine heavy structural maintenance inspections with automation. However, specific aircraft locations and the impact of SHM alternatives are yet to be defined. The paper presents a two stage approach centred on analysing maintenance intervals, and areas where improvements to an aircraft's availability can be achieved. This approach is explained with reference to real aircraft maintenance scenarios where critical areas are identified and the impact of implementing such technologies are assessed. The analysis requires initially sourcing information via maintenance documentation and then mapping sequences of steps from the data collected. As part of a study to highlight the approach two types of scheduled intervals were taken for analysis. Conventional DCheck (still adopted today) was modelled with a discrete event simulation tool called Arena. Savings of 3 hours per D-check interval could be realised by placing hotspot monitoring to a set of locations highlighted in the paper. This would equate to 6 hours saved over the life, which may be insufficient to justify investment in SHM technologies. It also proves that aircraft maintenance processes and damage tolerant design are well optimised from an initial design point of view and that the high degree of an aircraft disassembly required may only provide a very limited potential for SHM within the frame of current aircraft initial structural design. However aircraft structures are likely to fracture at locations other than those predicted initially. This effect is not critical from a safety point of view since those fractures are detected well before they become critical. However those damages being called the drop outs lead to specially directed inspections which are likely to fall outside of the conventional maintenance schedule and hence can become comparatively costly. The example of a 2400 FC interval only provided here has three items of which the critical item is a detailed inspection that always lies on the critical path, despite fluctuations with uncertainties. Substituting for a SHM centred process could save up to 280 hours over the aircraft life. With the cost of operation at a few <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR</b> per hour, application of SHM to drop out intervals to further optimise maintenance processes could certainly justify future investment...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of public support for the European car industry during the past decade. First, we identify the most relevant instruments of public support, and review their economic assessment. The European Commission increasingly recognizes the role of economic analysis in controlling public aid to the car industry, although the degree of economic assessment varies across di¤erent instruments of public support and individual state aid cases. Moreover, the state aid legislative framework is open to derogations and interpretations. In particular, the Temporary Framework, approved by the Commission to tackle the last financial and economic crisis de facto implied a relaxation of the state aid rules and foresaw no formal control of individual state aids. Second, we aim to estimate the amount of public support for European car manu- facturers. Three factors complicate the overall quantification of public support for each instrument: (i) the Commission does not scrutinize, and hence does not quantify all public support measures; (ii) the available information depends on whether the state aid is granted to individual companies or in the form of general schemes; and (iii) the available information depends on whether the aid is granted {{in the form of a}} grant, soft loan or guarantee. Our lower bound estimate of state aid suggests that the aid declined over the pre-crisis period, but peaked at EUR 1. 2 billion as a response to the last financial and economic crisis in 2009. Perhaps even more strikingly, this state aid was combined with an unprecedented amount of public support granted through scrapping schemes of at least EUR 4. 0 billion, and loans from the European <b>Investment</b> Bank of <b>EUR</b> 2. 8 billion, or an equivalent of EUR 400 million of "aid element". In conclusion, the existence of multiple public support instruments at different levels may create coordination problems and a lack of transparency, in spite of the Commis- sion's efforts. The lack of transparency in turn poses a challenge for the quantification of state aid and non-state aid support to any industry or sector. This paper provides a first step towards informing the policy debate on the e¤ects of public support to the car sector, and also stimulates the academic interest in the subject of state aid, and - more generally - public transfers to companies...|$|R
40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) {{are major}} drivers {{of social and}} {{economic}} change. They are also one of the key Thematic Objectives (TOs) in the European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF). The aim of these funds is to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. ICTs not only constitute an important sector themselves, but are also an important enabler of other sectors. This is why, analysis of ESIF data on planned ICT <b>investments</b> show <b>EUR</b> 12. 2 billion encoded in the dedicated TO, but when ICT categories in other TOs are included, this amount almost doubles, to EUR 21. 4 billion. Finding out more about the ICT investment plans of EU Member States and regions is not always a straightforward process. The available data for ESIF are structured in TOs and Categories of Intervention (CoIs); however, ICT investment often funds activities beyond the dedicated TOs and CoIs. To obtain a better picture of planned ICT investments, the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG CONNECT) and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) have developed an online tool to display planned ICT investment data on a regional basis. This tool will help EC officials, national and regional policymakers working on ICT issues, and beneficiaries of ESIF, to understand what kind of ICT activities are being planned in Europe. The ICT monitoring tool can be searched using a number of predefined filters, or searches of TOs and CoIs can be customised. The tool also contains a database of keywords built up by a semantic search for keywords in Operational Programmes (OPs). This database allows the user to identify OPs that mention a number of ICT activities more frequently than others, and to identify if a specific topic is mentioned in a region at all. The data set included in the tool is based on an in-depth study of individual OPs, as well as on aggregated data sets. When studying the available data, we found that Thematic Objective 2 (TO 2) does not account for all planned ESIF investments in ICT. Using a broader set of CoIs, planned spending on ICT almost doubled, from 3. 8 % to around 6. 6 % of the combined total of European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Funds (CF) and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, it is likely that even this method fails to capture all planned investments, as respondents to our study indicated that substantial investments in ICT will be allocated to other categories, which would increase ESIF investments in ICT to EUR 35. 5 billion. However, this estimate is not currently included in the tool, as the methods of estimating investments are not judged to be adequate. This range of different amounts of investment reflects the dual nature of ICT as an important sector and activity in itself, as well as an enabling technology in other public and private activities. Taking the moderate estimates, the EU Member States that plan by far the largest investments in ICT in absolute terms are Poland, Italy and Spain; the regions with the largest planned investments are Campania (IT), Sicilia (IT), Andalucía (ES), Slaskie (PL) and Puglia (IT). For example, the region of Campania plans to invest more ESIF in ICT than the whole of Germany. The greatest investments will be in broadband and ICT infrastructures (EUR 6. 9 billion), e-Inclusion and digital skills (EUR 3. 9 billion), e-Government (EUR 3. 4 billion), and smart cities and smart grids (EUR 3. 1 billion). To get a more in-depth view of future plans, we carried out a keyword search of ESIF data. Among the most frequently mentioned keywords are ICT innovation, e-Inclusion, broadband and digital content. This is partly because these keywords are broad and all-encompassing, but the findings also reflect the ambition of many regions to invest in ICT-based innovation activities. Quite substantial ICT investments will go to ICT-based innovation and digital content, but this will be listed under CoIs related to support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research and innovation, rather than the core CoIs for planned ICT investments.
