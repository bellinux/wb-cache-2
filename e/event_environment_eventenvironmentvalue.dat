5000|$|Instructional {{designers}} may guide learner {{attention by}} introducing learners to carefully selected objects {{and events that}} occur in certain environments. In some situations, {{it is not possible}} to have learners work with real objects, <b>events,</b> or <b>environments.</b> In these cases, instructional designers may create representations of the objects, <b>events,</b> or <b>environments.</b> These representations are called models. A model is a definition or representation of an object, <b>event,</b> or <b>environment</b> that includes some information regarding their properties, actions, or cause-effect relationships. Instructional designers may use a variety of models to help learners construct their own mental models. A model can take various mediated forms, from simple textual descriptions to complex, multimedia simulations.|$|R

50|$|The {{theory of}} model-centered {{instruction}} {{is based on}} the assumption that the purpose of instruction is to help learners construct knowledge about objects and <b>events</b> in their <b>environment.</b> In the field of cognitive psychology, theorists assert that knowledge is represented and stored in human memory as dynamic, networked structures generally known as schema or mental models. This concept of mental models was incorporated by Gibbons into the theory of model-centered instruction. This theory {{is based on the}} assumption that learners construct mental models as they process information they have acquired through observations of or interactions with objects, <b>events,</b> and <b>environments.</b> Instructional designers can assist learners by (a) helping them focus attention on specific information about an object, <b>event,</b> or <b>environment</b> and (b) initiating events or activities designed to trigger learning processes.|$|R

This new controller provides a detailed visual reference of the queue behaviour and provides information on important metrics, such as queue size. The controller, combined with the walking speed data, is validated against CCTV footage of airport passenger screening points, and the simulation outputs are compared to results obtained from queueing theory. A simulation approach provides superior results over the averaged results from queuing theory and a more useful insight into the behaviour of the system. ...|$|R

The case methodology was considered the most applicable tool to showcase the complexity of decisions and processes of computer systems management. The case studies demonstrate the importance of adhering to proven software development principles throughout the life cycle management of a computer application. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

The model is presented in both descriptive and visual formats, {{with the use of}} conceptual maps.

40|$|AbstractThe {{realization}} of innovative transport services, require increasingly greater flexibility and inexpensiveness of the service. In {{many cases the}} solution is to realize a demand responsive transportation system, in which there are two main goals: minimize costs and maximize flexibility. In this work, we address a Demand Responsive Transport System capable of managing incoming transport demand using a solution based on an insertion heuristics to solve an On-Line dynamic DaRP instance. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated dynamically in a discrete <b>events</b> <b>environment</b> in which it is possible to reproduce the movement of the vehicles, the passengers’ arrival to the stops, the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behavior of the passengers. Finally, {{at the end of the}} simulation, a set of performance indicators summarize the solution planned by the heuristics...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} an implementation of real-time simulation and control in DEVS-Scheme, a knowledge-based, discrete <b>event</b> <b>environment.</b> We illustrate a methodology {{in which the}} plant, its actuators and sensors are described by discrete event models developed within the event-based control paradigm. A model of the controller is employed to validate its design in a plant/actuator/sensor experimental frame. The same model configuration is then employed for actual control operation by connecting the simulation executive, suitably modified, to a programmable controller that interfaces to the real plant/actuator/sensor system. We show how this methodology is supported by real-time interpretation of the DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) formalism. A lower bound on the processing speed of a non-deterministic operating system relative to scheduled event times is derived which guarantees correct control timing. We show how the DEVS-based control can be distributed in a hierarchical [...] ...|$|R
