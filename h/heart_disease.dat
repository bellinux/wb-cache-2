In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
