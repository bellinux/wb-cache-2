25|$|Another {{minority}} is the Roma, who nonetheless {{have very}} little influence on Czech policy. Around 90% of the Roma that lived in the Czech Republic prior to World War II were exterminated by the Nazi Porajmos. The Roma there now are 80% post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary, or the descendants thereof. In total, the Roma in the CR now number around 200,000. There is Romani press in the CR, written in both Czech and Romani, but Romani radio is broadcast in Czech {{and there is no}} Romani television. Romani is also absent from legislative, judiciary, and other political texts but it has recently entered some university and elementary school courses. Life expectancy, literacy, median wage, school enrolment, and other socio-economic markers remain low while, according to Říčan (1998), Roma compose the majority of prison and <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> populations despite accounting for only a fraction of a percent of Czech population.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Wayne Haley {{was arrested}} for {{stealing}} a calculator from Walmart in 1997. Because Haley had two prior convictions for theft, as well as prior felony convictions for delivery of a controlled substance and attempted robbery, he was sentenced as a <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> under Texas law to sixteen {{and a half years}} in prison. It later came to light that Haley's robbery offense occurred three days before his conviction on the controlled substance charge was finalized, so the <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> statute might not have applied. The <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> issue was discovered after Haley had exhausted his appeals. As Solicitor General, Cruz declined to vacate the sentence saying [...] "I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors." [...] The Supreme Court later remanded the case to lower courts based on Haley's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. During oral argument, Cruz conceded that Haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since Haley's attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have Haley re-incarcerated during the appeal process. After remand, Haley was re-sentenced to [...] "time served".|$|E

2500|$|Subsequently, the {{committee}} appointed {{in the same}} year by the central government to study the utility of the existence of this law, reported in 1950 that the system violated the spirit of the Indian constitution. The Habitual Offenders Act (HOA) (1952) was enacted in the place of CTA; it states that a <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> is one who has been a victim of subjective and objective influences and has manifested a set practice in crime, and also presents a danger to society. The HOA effectively re-stigmatised the already marginalised [...] "criminal tribes". The previously criminalised tribes still suffer a stigma, because of the ineffective nature of the new Act, which in effect meant relisting of the supposed denotified tribes. Today the social category generally known as the denotified and nomadic tribes includes approximately 60 million people in India.|$|E

He failed to appear at the trial date in 2006, but appeared three years later to plead guilty to marijuana possession and was given a discharge. In 2011, he was charged with robbery and [...] "uttering threats" [...] in Vancouver, but only convicted of the lesser charge of uttering threats. He claimed that he committed the 2011 robbery so that he would be incarcerated, in order to kick his drug habit. He received a psychiatric evaluation, but was determined to be fit to stand for trial.|$|E
2500|$|The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32-year-old Muslim-Canadian <b>habitual</b> <b>offender</b> {{and drug}} addict from Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he expressed his motives as being related [...] "to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs." [...] To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk.

According to the body, since much of 'Habitual Offenders Act (1952)' {{is derived from the}} earlier 'Criminal Tribes Act 1871', it doesn't show a marked departure in its intent, only gives the formed notified tribes a new name i.e. Denotified tribes, hence the stigma continues so does the oppression, as the law is being denounced on two counts, first that [...] "all human beings are born free and equal", and second that it negates a valuable principle of the criminal justice system– innocent until proven guilty.|$|R
