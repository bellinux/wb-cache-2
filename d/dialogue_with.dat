5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

One {{of the scenes}} from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting {{at the top of}} Minas Tirith.

5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Maitreyi {{appears in}} ancient Indian texts, {{such as in}} a {{dialogue}} where she explores the Hindu concept of Atman (soul or self) in a <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. According to this dialogue, love is driven by a person's soul, and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. This Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of Sureshvara's varttika, a commentary.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} academic essays on the game's presentation, narrative and localization aspects.

5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal feminists and others. At the same time, she maintained a <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E
5|$|Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{lays the}} {{juridical}} foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations.
