It {{is well known that}} the hydrolysis of large molecules into small, directly biodegradable ones is the rate limiting step of the overall anaerobic process. The present work studies the development of the hydrolytic and acidogenic stages of dairy manure with different solid concentrations (40, 60 and 80 g VS/L) at ambient temperature (20 ° C). The purpose was to determine the operational conditions that provide a liquid fraction with a high soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a high volatile fatty acids (VFA) content in manure before the methanogenic stage starts up. At 20 ° C, the evolution of the studied parameters showed that, in a controlled plug-flow <b>dung</b> <b>pit,</b> the hydrolytic and acidogenic stages progressed moderately in a continuous way during the 25 days that the experimentation lasted, whereas no methanization was observed. Supernatant COD and VFA concentrations increased 30 % and 107 %, respectively, for the 60 g VS/L samples. Manure was also operated at 35 ° C with a similar increase in supernatant COD but a higher increase in VFA, 154 %. For both operational temperatures, the predominant VFAs were, in this order, acetic, propionic and butyric acids. During the operation at 35 ° C, the methanogenic stage started between days 20 and 25 for the samples with lower solids content, i. e. 40 and 60 g VS/L...|$|E
50|$|The badger {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and iconic animals in Britain. Most people recognise badgers by their black- and white striped head, but because they are nocturnal mammals, they are rarely seen. They do, however, roam onto Gillies Hill and signs of badger activity (heavily worn badger paths with distinctive 5-toed footprints, claw marks on trees, <b>dung</b> <b>pits</b> and coarse, wiry badger hair caught on the barbs of wire fences) have been documented. In the winter of 2011 a badger was photographed on the hill with a hidden wildlife camera. The largest threat to badgers on Gillies Hill - outside of potential quarrying and development - is the traffic that travels along Polmaise Road.|$|R

The land {{suitable}} for dumping waste, was fast exhausting and as a mean of lengthening the life time of the available dumping areas, the CMC decided to do a pilot study to determine the feasibility of converting solid waste into compost. Prior to the pi lot study, two other studies, (1) a survey on the production of compost in Sri Lanka, on commercial basis (2) a literature survey, were done. // Three organizations that produce compost on commercial basis were surveyed under the first study. They are, 1. Hiat Aggro Ltd. 2. Department of Agrarian Services 3. Water Resources Board Hiat Agg"ro Ltd. use coir waste, leaves and poul trydroppings to produce compost. Most of the compost produced by this company, are exported {{and the rest is}} sold in the local market. // The compost produced by a cultivation officer for the Department of agrarian Services, using garden waste and cow <b>dung,</b> in <b>pits,</b> are sold by the Dept. of Agrarian Services in 1 kg. packets. // The compost produced by the Water Resources Board,using grass cuttings and cow dung is used in it's plant nursery and the excess is sold in 2 kg. packets, at the sales outlet of the Board. // The second study was on the research work that has been carried out, world over, on composting of municipal waste. The literature survey revealed that there are several fundamental factors that are applicable to a composting operation, such as, carbon to nitrogen ratio, temperature, moisture content,shredding, aeration, etc. // The last study was the pilot project, where the behavior of six municipal waste piles were studied under different conditions of carbon to nitrogen ratios and aeration. Urea was used to lower the C-N ratio and aeration was provided by using aeration frames. // The non compostable material could be sufficiently removed by hand picking and sieving. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of the waste, in the piles, studied under the pilot project, varied from 23 to 88, and within this range, waste decomposed at a fairly satisfactory rate, stabilizing within an almost qual time period. The rate of decomposition retards when the moisture content is over 55 % and the optimum range is 40 % to 50 %, which can be maintained by wetting the piles once in 2 - 3 days. The solid waste of the Colombo Municipal Council, can be converted into compost in about 40 days, maintaining a temperature above 60 C, within the pile, for over 7 days.  when the particle size is less than 2 inches (5 cm).  when piled on an aeration frame and turned once in 3 - 4 days.  when moisture content is maintained between 40 and 50 %, by wetting once in 2 - 3 days. // The compost, produced, is more suitable {{to be used as a}} soil stabilizer, as it is, and if it is to be used as an organic fertilizer, it should be supplemented with phosphorus. Compost, from municipal waste, can be produced as an odorless, dry powder...|$|R

Among these, we highlight the organic origin, that allow an improvement of soil quality and increased crop production. In this context, this dissertation presents a study of five years, from 2008 to 2012, of an Agroforestry System (AFS) for growing corn and beans intercropped with gliricidia and cashews, in conditions of northern coast of CearÃ. The (AFS), had four treatments: Testimony (A), under normal conditions the AFS; Dung (B), {{with the addition of}} 116 grams of sheep <b>dung</b> in the <b>pit</b> of corn and beans at planting time; Bagana (C), with addition of 16 tons of carnauba straw on the soil as mulch; and Dung + Bagana (D), which is a combination of treatments B and C. In addition to the experimental treatments, 10 local farmers were interviewed to develop the treatment (T) Regional Testimony (local production system). Two analyzes were performed comparing this 5 treatments: Productivity of the system and its Economic analysis. It was concluded that the AFS assists in fixing agriculture, avoiding the opening of new areas for cultivation, having succeeded to higher production levels than the obtained by local itinerant cultivation. Regarding the productivity, was noticed an increasing pattern from treatment T (lower middle), through A, to the D, which has always had the highest average productivity besides showing greater resilience to the effects of drought. The T and A treatments were not economically viable, with negative indicators. Whereas the B, C and D treatments proved feasible economically and financially, with the best indicators in treatment D. For this set of analyzes, the proposed AFS, especially the treatment D, presents itself as the most advantageous for the exploitation of agriculture in studied conditions. Durante milhares de anos, diferentes povos tÃm praticado uma agricultura baseada no manejo dos materiais disponÃveis nas suas prÃprias terras. Dentre esses, podemos destacar os de origem orgÃnica, que possibilitam uma melhoria da qualidade do solo e um aumento da produtividade vegetal. Nesse contexto, esta dissertaÃÃo apresenta um estudo sobre 5 anos, de 2008 Ã 2012, de um Sistema Agroflorestal (SAF) para cultivo de milho e feijÃo, consorciados com gliricÃdia e caju, nas condiÃÃes edafoclimÃticas do litoral norte do CearÃ. O referido SAF, apresentou 4 tratamentos: Testemunho (A), em condiÃÃes normais do SAF; Esterco (B), com adiÃÃo de 116 gramas de esterco de ovelha na cova do milho e do feijÃo no momento do plantio; Bagana (C), com adiÃÃo de 16 toneladas de bagana de carnaÃba sobre o solo como cobertura morta; e o Esterco + Bagana (D), que Ã uma combinaÃÃo dos tratamentos B e C. AlÃm dos tratamentos experimentais, foram entrevistados 10 agricultores locais para elaborar o tratamento (T) Testemunho Regional (sistema de produÃÃo local). Foram realizados duas anÃlises comparando os 5 tratamentos: Produtividade do sistema e sua AnÃlise econÃmica. Concluiu-se que o SAF auxilia na fixaÃÃo da agricultura, evitando a abertura de novas Ãreas para cultivo, pois conseguiu nÃveis produtivos superiores aos obtidos pela agricultura itinerante local. Em relaÃÃo Ã produtividade, percebeu-se um padrÃo crescente desde o tratamento T (menores mÃdias), passando pelo A, atÃ o D, que apresentou sempre as maiores mÃdias de produtividade alÃm de apresentar uma maior resiliÃncia aos efeitos da seca. Os tratamentos T e A nÃo foram economicamente viÃveis, apresentando indicadores negativos. JÃ os tratamentos B, C e D mostraram-se viÃvel econÃmica e financeiramente, com os melhores indicadores no tratamento D. Por esse conjunto de anÃlises, o SAF proposto, principalmente o tratamento D, se apresenta como o mais vantajoso para exploraÃÃo da agropecuÃria nas condiÃÃes estudadas...|$|R
