5|$|Some of the <b>foundations</b> {{are located}} in {{confined}} spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult. Dulles Transit Partners offered to inspect seven <b>foundations</b> that were easily accessible, but the FTA insisted that all <b>foundations</b> be tested. Dulles Transit Partners and MWAA agreed to test all <b>foundations</b> before the bridge piers were built upon them. This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line between the West Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations to be taken out of service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The <b>foundations</b> were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing <b>foundations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger <b>foundations</b> than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their <b>foundations</b> on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and <b>foundations</b> increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the <b>foundations</b> were complete. The deeper the <b>foundations</b> needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
5|$|When the Orange Line was {{originally}} constructed in 1977, <b>foundations</b> for the bridges {{to carry the}} Silver Line over I-66 to the median of the Dulles Access Road were built up to ground level. These <b>foundations</b> included steel piles that were driven {{into the ground and}} capped with concrete. However, detailed records for these original <b>foundations</b> were lost. As a result, engineers asked for the <b>foundations</b> to be inspected by digging around them to determine the condition of each pile under the concrete foundation caps.|$|E

5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the <b>foundations</b> of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} a new hierarchical surface decomposition method for multiscale analysis of surface meshes. In contrast to other multiresolution methods, our approach relies on spectral properties of the surface to build a binary hierarchical decomposition. Namely, we utilize the first nontrivial eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to recursively decompose the surface. For this reason we coin our surface decomposition the Fiedler tree. Using the Fiedler tree ensures a number of attractive properties, including: mesh-independent decomposition, well-formed and nearly equi-areal surface patches, and noise robustness. We show how the evenly distributed patches can be exploited for generating multiresolution high quality uniform meshes. Additionally, our decomposition permits a natural means for carrying out wavelet methods, resulting in an intuitive method for producing feature-sensitive meshes at multiple scales.
