25|$|Major {{clothing}} brands {{associated with}} bushwear are the broad brimmed Akubra hats, Driza-Bone coats and R.M. Williams bushmen's outfitters (featuring in particular: moleskin trousers, riding boots and merino woolwear). Blundstone Footwear and Country Road are also linked to this tradition. Made from {{the leaves of}} Livistona australis, the cabbage <b>tree</b> <b>hat</b> was the first uniquely Australian headwear, {{dating back to the}} early 1800s, and was the hat of choice for colonial-born Australians. Traditionally worn by jackaroos and swagmen in the blow-fly infested Australian outback, the cork hat is a type of headgear strongly associated with Australia, and comprises cork strung from the brim, to ward off insects.|$|R
5000|$|A cabbage <b>tree</b> <b>hat</b> (also {{known as}} a cabbage palm hat) is a hat made from {{the leaves of the}} Livistona australis, also known as the cabbage-tree palm. It is known as the first distinctively Australian {{headwear}} in use. Seeking protection from the sun, early European settlers started to make hats using fibre from the native palm, which soon became popular throughout the colonies. The process involved boiling, then drying, and finally bleaching the leaves. The Powerhouse Museum describes a cabbage-tree hat thus: [...] "Finely woven natural straw coloured hat; high tapering domed crown, wide flat brim; applied layered hat band of coarser plaiting with zig-zag border edges." ...|$|R
40|$|Statistical machine {{translation}} (SMT) {{plays an important}} role in the automatic translation of the large and increasing volume of documents that has become globally available. The results of SMT are often still lacking in various aspects including word order. This thesis focuses on the improvement of hierarchical SMT, in particular Hiero. Hiero rules lack nonterminal labels. This gives them little context and makes their combination into full translations poorly coordinated, and strongly dependent on the language model. In this thesis, bilingual labels are added to Hiero rules. These bilingual labels lead to more coherent translations with better word order, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on three language pairs. The proposed labels require no syntactic information, and use only the information from word alignments. This distinguishes them from various types of syntactic labels earlier proposed in the literature. Bilingual labels are based on a newly proposed framework called hierarchical alignment <b>trees</b> (<b>HATs).</b> <b>HATs</b> are bilingual <b>trees</b> that represent the hierarchical translation equivalence structure induced from word alignments. HATs maximally decompose word alignments into phrase pairs, and provide an explicit description of the local reordering taking place within each phrase pair. The last part of the thesis is concerned with the complexity of empirical translation equivalence. Given a word alignment and a grammar, it studies the question what it means for the grammar to cover the word alignment. HATs play a key role in answering this question exactly and efficiently, and are applied to characterize alignment complexity for various language pairs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} measures 66 x 92.7 cm. It {{is dominated}} by muted tones of yellow and brown. The image {{is divided into three}} areas by two horizontal lines, perhaps representing the sky, sea and earth; a diagonal line seems to put the top right corner of the painting in the dark of night, while the rest is in the light of day. The painting is littered with a confused mixture of forms, many with aspects of humans, animals, and plants. The various animal forms are derived from Catalan ceramics, including a lizard wearing a conical <b>hat.</b> A <b>tree</b> to the right of centre has a large eye in its green crown and a human ear on its brown trunk. Hanging from the tree is a shape covered with more eyes, possibly a pinecone, or perhaps a leaf or a spider; {{at the base of the}} tree is a folded newspaper with the French word jour (day). Further right, in the background, is a human figure following a cattle-drawn plough, based on the Altamira cave paintings. Also in the background, towards the centre, is a ramshackle house with chimney, and further left a tree-like object bearing the flags of France, Spain and Catalonia. Another plant-like object to the left bears a further flag, possibly French, perhaps symbolising the border between France (left) and Spain (right) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new data structure, the VList, that is compact, thread safe and significantly faster to use than Linked Lists {{for nearly all}} list operations. Space usage can be reduced by 50 % to 90 % and in typical list operations speed improved by factors ranging from 4 to 20 or more. Some important operations such as indexing and length are typically changed from O(N) to O(1) and O(lgN) respectively. A language interpreter Visp, using a dialect of Common Lisp, has been implemented using VLists and the benchmark comparison with OCAML reported. It is also shown how to adapt the structure to create variable length arrays, persistent deques and functional hash tables. The VArray requires no resize copying and has an average O(1) random access time.

500|$|While Chaplin's comedic {{style is}} broadly defined as slapstick, it is {{considered}} restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing {{his work as a}} mix of [...] "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his <b>hat</b> to the <b>tree</b> in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] and [...] "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" [...] are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.|$|R
