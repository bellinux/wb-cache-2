40|$|Abstract. After the {{grinding}} process, the cutting <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> cemented carbide milling tools tend to chipping. Chipping {{has a strong}} influence on the tool performance. For this reason, the cutting edges are further prepared. Additionally, a cutting edge rounding {{has an impact on}} the wear behavior and the process stability. For the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> milling tools, magnetic finishing is a promising process. This paper describes the process of magnetic finishing. The influencing parameters, i. e. the process time and the distance between the cutting tool and the magnetic disks, are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic finishing on the tool life is demonstrated using the example of a milling process with titanium...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn micro milling, {{which is}} mostly used in mold and die making, process {{reliability}} and predictability of tool failure are important. Particularly in precision and micro machining, tool breakage is hardly detectable and the requirements on accuracy are very high. Immersed tumbling {{is an appropriate}} process for the defined cutting <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> micro milling tools. Its effects like increasing tool wear performance and tool life has been evaluated. In this paper, different cutting edge preparation processes showed that in cutting tests different effects occur regarding tool wear, process forces and surface quality.

In fierce fighting the Germans temporarily {{took control of}} the hill, but were dislodged {{by the end of the}} day, with both regiments virtually destroyed. From 11–13 October, Allied aircraft bombarded Aachen, selecting targets closest to American lines; on 14 October, the 26th Infantry Regiment was ordered to clear an industrial zone on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Aachen in <b>preparation</b> for the attack on the city itself. On 15 October, in an effort to widen the gap between the two American pincers, the Germans again counterattacked the 1st Infantry Division; although a number of heavy tanks managed to break through American lines, the bulk of the German forces were destroyed by artillery and air support. On the next day, the Germans attempted to mount local counterattacks with the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, but, after sustaining heavy losses, were forced to suspend further offensive action.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the marginal discrepancy (MD) and internal discrepancy (ID) of ceramic crowns manufactured by a CAD/CAM system, having different finish lines. The hypotheses tested were that the finish line type would not influence the MD or ID of the crowns, and ID would not change in different regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three aluminum master dies (height: 5. 5 mm, Ø: 7. 5 mm, conicity: 6 °) with different finish lines (TC: tilted chamfer; LC: large chamfer; RS: rounded shoulder) were manufactured. Ten impressions were made from each master die using a modified parallelometer. Impressions were poured in type IV dental stone, and 30 ceramic crowns (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar) were subsequently milled. The crowns were fixed on their respective metallic die using a metallic fixation device. The distance between the external <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the crown to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cervical <b>preparation</b> was performed at 50 points on the respective metallic die (MD analysis). With the replica technique, the ID values of each crown were further evaluated at 12 points equidistant to each other in three regions: radius (R), axial (A), and occlusal (Occl). The measurements were performed using an optical microscope (250 ×). The data (μm) were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 300 M {{steel is}} widely used in the {{aerospace}} industry to manufacture landing gears due to its ultrahigh strength and high fracture toughness. Surface integrity in the hard turning process (one of the final manufacturing processes in making landing gears) can be influenced by tool geometries and cutting conditions. An experimental study is conducted on 300 M steel to understand the role of cutting tool geometry and cutting conditions on surface integrity (surface roughness and residual stresses). Cutting tool geometries are varied along the nose edge region (chamfer, hone, and chamfer-hone). These varied geometries are tested at different cutting conditions to highlight the combinational complexity <b>of</b> cutting <b>edges</b> and cutting conditions in producing surface roughness and residual stresses. The results show the necessity <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> in improving machining surface integrity in such a material...|$|R
40|$|A {{main reason}} for {{premature}} tool failure in micro milling is the irregular wear behavior of the cutting tools. An approach to improve the tool wear behavior is a defined cutting edge preparation using immersed tumbling. A particular challenge is the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> micro milling tools with small diameters D â¤ 0. 5 mm. High loads within the preparation process can lead to outbreaks <b>of</b> the cutting <b>edge</b> and tool breakage. Furthermore, the influence <b>of</b> changed cutting <b>edge</b> geometry regarding the process behavior {{has to be more}} examined for these tool diameters. In this paper, micro milling tools with a diameter D = 0. 2 mm will be prepared and the influence on the cutting process will be presented and discussed. The experiments will show a better wear behavior for the prepared tools and an improved surface roughness on the machined workpiece...|$|R

40|$|IT HAS been {{established}} that the durationof the action potential of cardiac muscle {{is a function of}} the frequency of stimulation. 1 " 3 The changes in the shape and the area of the rabbit ventricular action potential upon alteration of the stimulus frequency have not, however, been examined. Such changes in action potential shape are of fundamental significance since, unlike changes in shape produced by drugs, temperature, and varia-tion of extracellular ionic concentration, they take place without disrupting metabolic proc-esses or diffusion gradients. These initial experiments were designed to examine the magnitude and time course of changes in the shape of the rabbit action po-tential. They have shown that the ionic mech-anism which produces the cardiac action potential is extremely flexible and can pro-duce rapid changes in the time course of the individual ionic conductances. Methods Rabbits were killed by a blow on the neck. The heart was excised within 30 seconds and imme-diately transferred to a dish filled with aerated Krebs-Hensleit solution at 38 C.; within a further 30 seconds the right ventricular wall was excised and quickly transferred to an organ bath main-tained at 38 C. ± 0. 5 C. The organ bath was made of silver and was perfused with Krebs-Hensleit solution aerated with 95 per cent 0 o + 5 per cent C 02.

40|$|Excitatory and {{inhibitory}} junction potentials of circular {{smooth muscle}} cells in guinea pig ileum and colon are suppressed 30 - 90 minutes after setting up in vitro preparations. We have previously shown this ‘unresponsive’ period {{is associated with}} a transient loss of dye coupling between smooth muscle cells, which subsequently recovers over the ensuing 30 - 90 minutes; junction potentials recover in parallel with dye coupling (Carbone et al., 2012). Here, we investigated which components of dissection trigger the initial loss of coupling. Intracellular recordings were made from circular muscle cells of guinea pig ileum with micropipettes containing 5 % carboxyfluorescein. After allowing 90 - 120 minutes for junction potentials to reach full amplitude, we re-cut all 4 <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>preparation</b> more than 1 mm from the recording sites. This caused a reduction in the amplitude of IJPs from 17. 2 ± 0. 7 mV to 9. 5 ± 1. 5 mV (P< 0. 001, n= 12) and a significant reduction in dye coupling. Both recovered within 60 minutes. We repeated this experiment (n= 4), recording both 1 mm and 4 mm from the cut edge: both sites were equally affected by re-cutting the sides <b>of</b> the <b>preparation.</b> Equilibrated preparations were stretched to 150 % of their original length, this had no significant effect on junction potentials or dye coupling. Setting up preparations in low calcium solution did not prevent the initial suppression of IJPs and dye coupling. Application of 3 µM indomethacin (n= 3), 10 µM ketotifen (n= 4) or 10 µM forskolin during dissection did not prevent the suppression of IJPs and dye coupling. If dissection damage was reduced, by leaving the mucosa and submucosa attached to the circular muscle, IJPs showed less initial suppression than in preparations where the layers were dissected off. We conclude that physical damage to the gut wall triggers loss of gap junction coupling and neuromuscular transmission, this is not due to stretch, influx of calcium ions, release of prostaglandins or mast cell...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: While superhard {{cutting tools}} {{are being used}} {{increasingly}} in automotive plants worldwide, their adoption within the automotive supply chain is not universal. Important issues relating to successful implementation of superhard cutting tool materials in such appli-cations include the ageing effect of grey iron, proper <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the cutting tools, and cutting conditions adopted. The paper examines quantitatively, the ageing effect on machin-ability of grey iron with polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) cutting tools. The findings confirm that tool life increases with higher idle time after shakeout of the casting and the threshold period of 100 h is applicable to PCBN tools also. The benefits of using superhard cut-ting tools, including savings in increased uptime and cost per part {{and their impact on}} system costs, are considered in an illustrative case study. Here, it was found that imparting a wiper to the tool can beneficially increase tool life to the point of making PCBN economical to use over ceramic cutting tools and can result in relatively high savings for the plant...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the case}} of hard {{machining}} of steels, negative rake tools generate compressive deformation and high temperature under the cutting edge, leading to phase transformation or “white layers”. The resulting surface integrity can be predicted by numerical simulations which may be validated by comparing simulated and measured strain fields. Recent high speed imaging devices have facilitated strain field measurement by Digital Image Correlation (DIC), even at high strain rates. However, the analyse is generally restricted to the primary shear zone {{and not to the}} workpiece under the machined surface. For this study, a double-frame camera and a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, generally used in the field of fluid mechanics, have been employed to record images during an orthogonal cutting operation of a hardened steel. The effect of the rake angle and the <b>edge</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> c-BN tools on the subsurface displacement field, which has been experimentally investigated by using DIC, are presented in this paper together with an analysis on the origins of the strains. The results of these measurements will be used to validate cutting numerical simulations or to improve hybrid modelling of surface integrity...|$|R

40|$|Background: The pancreatojejunostomy has {{notoriously}} {{been known}} to carry {{a high rate of}} operative complications,morbidity and mortality,mainly due to anastomotic leak and ensuing septic complications. Objective:In order to decrease anastomotic leak and its attendant morbidity and mortality in operations requiring a pancreato-jejunal anastomosis, and also in order to simplify the operation,a new technique was developed by the author and subsequently termed “JEMI”,i. e.,Jejunal Eversion Mucosectomy and Invagination.  Method: This method consists <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> a Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, eversion of the limb end to expose the jejunal mucosa, submucosal saline injection, and mucosectomy of a 2 cm cuff of mucosa saving the submucosal vessels and a seromuscular cuff of jejunum. The pancreatic remnant is next prepared to accept the prepared limb by freeing 2 cm of pancreatic tissue. This is followed by suturing the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the mucosa to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the pancreatic capsule via 3 / 0 vicryl or PDS, pulling the mucosectomized cuff over the pancreatic remnant,and suturing the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the seromuscular cuff onto the pancreatic capsule via 3 / 0 vicryl or silk.  Result: 18 patients underwent a pancreatojejunal anastomosis after pancreatic resection during a 4 year period by the author. No case of pancreatic fistula or leak was observed in any of the cases, and all cases were discharged from the hospital on PO day 6, except for one patient who was discharged on PO day 12 due to delayed gastric emptying, and one early post operative death due to extensive myocardial infarction.  Conclusion: This technique appears promising and is gaining popularity in our institution, and is therefore recommended as a choice method for any operation requiring a pancreatojejunal anastomosis...|$|R
