5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt).

5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods.</b> The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered <b>dangerous</b> <b>goods</b> for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E
50|$|Academic communitarians also {{contend that}} the nature of the {{political}} community is misunderstood by liberalism. Where liberal philosophers described the polity as a neutral framework of rules within which a multiplicity of commitments to moral values can coexist, academic communitarians argue that such a thin conception of political community was both empirically misleading and normatively <b>dangerous.</b> <b>Good</b> societies, these authors believe, rest on much more than neutral rules and procedures—they rely on a shared moral culture. Some academic communitarians argued even more strongly on behalf of such particularistic values, suggesting that these were the only kind of values which matter and that it is a philosophical error to posit any truly universal moral values.|$|R

30|$|At {{the end of}} an EVB’s first (automotive) life, battery {{redemption}} {{takes place}} (Gohla-Neudecker et al. 2015; Bräuer 2016). European law poses the legal obligation for this take-back on the automotive OEMs, respectively, collaborating car dealers or workshops (e.g., Directive 2000 / 53 /EC 2000; Directive 2006 / 66 /EC 2006). To prevent non-authorized third parties from performing maintenance work on the battery systems or accessing the battery systems’ usage and status data, automotive OEM’s employ proprietary components that demand for OEM-specific equipment and that use encryption on battery-specific data streams and stored battery data (CBR:PE°# 2; SPR:MD°# 1,°# 3, CEI:M 1 °# 1, BRC:BR 2 °# 1) (Ahmadi et al. 2014; Monhof et al. 2015; Neubauer et al. 2015).

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{positioning}} functions in railways today rely on track side sensors that are efficient, but offer mainly discrete positioning, lead to high maintenance costs and differ between countries. Railways demonstrate their {{interest for the}} localization technology based on GNSS. Use of the satellite technology for safety operations is a major possibility. The condition is to evaluate {{the positioning}} function {{in terms of the}} RAMS attributes, as required by railway standards. However, no current evaluation methods are able to consider the signal degradations of wireless communications caused by the railway environment. We propose, in this paper, a methodology based on an Operational Experience Feedback procedure for quantifying RAMS properties and their sensibility to the operational conditions. The applications will focus on the Tr@in–MD project devoted to <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> tracking. Scenarios, i. e. temporal sequences constituted of up and down states that succeed randomly, will help to provide the results. To obtain different scenarios of evolution, the Ergospace software will be used. Raw data associated to a wagon that runs on an itinerary in different typical railway environments, with different satellite configurations, will be collected and processed...|$|R
