2500|$|According to Morin, [...] "the global {{intellectual}} property regime {{is currently in}} the midst of a paradigm shift". Indeed, up until the early 2000s the <b>global</b> <b>IP</b> regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that [...] "the emerging discourse of the <b>global</b> <b>IP</b> regime advocates for greater policy ﬂexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries." [...] Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles. However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In future {{ubiquitous}} communication environments, broad-band {{wireless communication}} will become popular. Also, wireless LAN {{devices such as}} IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g and wireless PAN devices such as Blue-tooth and ZigBee may be integrated into mobile terminals with reason-able cost and complementarily used with existing cellular networks. This means that mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), which are composed between these narrow range communication devices without fixed net-work infrastructures will be seamlessly connected to <b>global</b> networks (<b>IP</b> networks). For future deployment of MANET protocols, we discuss their testing issues with some experimental results. ...|$|R
