The second mate's door was on the hook, but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless. He, too, was young and could sleep like a stone. Remained the steward, but he was not likely to wake up before he was called. I got a sleeping- suit out of my room and, coming back on deck, saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the main-hatch, glimmering white in the darkness, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.

40|$|Attending {{the opera}} {{in the long}} 18 th century was an {{experience}} quite unlike our own theatrical experience.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{controlled}} Lagrangians {{is a technique}} for stabilizing underactuated mechanical systems which involves modifying a system’s energy and dynamic structure through feedback. These modifications can obscure the effect of physical dissipation in the closed-loop. For example, generic damping can destabilize an equilibrium which is closed-loop stable for a conservative system model. In this paper, we consider the effect of damping on Euler-Poincaré (special reduced Lagrangian) systems which have been stabilized about an equilibrium using the method of controlled Lagrangians. We describe a choice of feedback dissipation which asymptotically stabilizes a sub-class of controlled Euler-Poincaré systems subject to physical damping. As an example, we consider intermediate axis rotation of a <b>damped</b> rigid <b>body</b> with a single internal rotor. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} into Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has included work on biologically inspired propulsion mechanisms, for instance flapping foils. The first {{aim of this}} thesis is to develop an accurate non-linear model of a flapping foil AUV, including the forces and moments due to the flapping foil propulsion. The non-linear model is based on standard characteristic equations for a six degree of freedom problem, with components due to hydrostatics (vehicle weight and buoyancy), hydrodynamic <b>damping</b> (<b>body</b> drag), added mass, coriolis forces and the net forces and moments due to {{the motion of the}} six flapping foils. The instantaneous model of the flapping foil consists of an analytical model of the angle of attack with respect to the free stream flow. The model depends on empirically derived coefficients of lift (CL), chordal force (Cc) and drag (CD). The second aim of this thesis is to test the flapping foil AUV model open loop. Two tests are performed: a square wave pitch and yaw command. This data will provide a degree of confidence in the flapping foil AUV model, or highlight the need for additional characterization of certain vehicle parameters. (cont.) The final aim of this thesis is to design a closed loop strategy and repeat the tests performed on the open loop system. We use feedback linearization which attempts to cancel the system non-linearities, and thus specify the system response exactly. It is demonstrated that the tracking performance of the closed loop control system is satisfactory. by William Duncan Lewis Booth. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceThis work {{explored}} how {{the perception}} of violin notes {{is influenced by the}} magnitude of the applied vibrato and by the level of damping of the violin resonance modes. Damping influences the “peakiness” of the frequency response, and vibrato interacts with this peakiness by producing fluctuations in spectral content as well as in frequency and amplitude. Initially, it was shown that thresholds for detecting a change in vibrato amplitude were independent of <b>body</b> <b>damping,</b> and thresholds for detecting a change in <b>body</b> <b>damping</b> were independent of vibrato amplitude. A study of perceptual similarity using triadic comparison showed that vibrato amplitude and damping were largely perceived as independent dimensions. A series of listening tests was conducted employing synthesized, recorded or live performance to probe perceptual responses in terms of “liveliness” and preference. The results do not support the conclusion that “liveliness” results from the combination of the use of vibrato and a “peaky” violin response. Judgments based on listening to single notes showed inconsistent patterns for liveliness, while preferences were highest for damping that was slightly less than for a reference (real) violin. In contrast, judgments by players based on many notes showed preference for damping close to the reference value...|$|R

40|$|A longstanding open {{question}} in classical mechanics is to formulate the least action principle for dissipative systems. In this work, we give a general formulation of this principle by considering a whole conservative system including the <b>damped</b> moving <b>body</b> and its environment receiving the dissipated energy. This composite system has the conservative Hamiltonian $H=K_ 1 +V_ 1 +H_ 2 $ where $K_ 1 $ is the kinetic {{energy of the}} moving body, $V_ 1 $ its potential energy and $H_ 2 $ {{the energy of the}} environment. The Lagrangian can be derived by using the usual Legendre transformation $L= 2 K_ 1 + 2 K_ 2 -H$ where $K_ 2 $ is the total kinetic energy of the environment. An equivalent expression of this Lagrangian is $L=K_ 1 -V_ 1 -E_d$ where $E_d$ is the energy dissipated by the friction from the moving body into the environment {{from the beginning of the}} motion. The usual variation calculus of least action leads to the correct equation of the damped motion. We also show that this general formulation is a natural consequence of the virtual work principle.
