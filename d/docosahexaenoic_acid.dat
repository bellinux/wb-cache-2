5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

LXR activation by T 0901317 increased basolateral cholesterol efflux to lipoprotein particles isolated at a density of 1. 21 g/ml or higher. Oleic and arachidonic acids attenuated the amount of cholesterol isolated from these particles. Stearic, linoleic and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acids</b> also decreased cholesterol efflux from basolateral membranes, with the polyunsaturated fatty acids being the most potent.

Except for oleic acid, all fatty acids substantially attenuated an increase in ABCA 1 mass secondary to LXR activation. Inhibiting acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity prevented the decrease in cholesterol efflux caused by oleic acid. Thus, in response to LXR activation, all fatty acids decreased the efflux of cholesterol from the basolateral membrane of CaCo- 2 cells.

Preexposure of neutrophils for 15 - 30 min to 1 - 10 micrograms/ml PUFA reduced the random and chemotactic migration to both FMLP- and fungi-activated complement.

The important nutritional qualities of this species have been correlated with chlorophyll- a concentration, sea surface temperature, and phytoplankton density in their growth environments. The higher proportions of total polyunsaturated fatty <b>acids,</b> eicosapentaenoic, and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acids</b> in the edible oysters collected from the wild habitats were significantly correlated with chlorophylla concentration revealing {{the role of the}} phytoplanktons to contribute to the occurrence of these vital fatty acids. The ideal atherogenic index (AI); thrombogenicity index (TI); hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio (HH); and balanced quantities of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and low cholesterol contents qualified C. madrasensis as a potential health food...|$|R
