25|$|Because cVDPV2 strains {{continued}} to arise from trivalent oral vaccine that included attenuated WPV2, in April and May 2016 this vaccine {{was replaced with}} a bivalent version lacking WPV2 as well as trivalent injected <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine</b> that cannot lead to cVDPV cases. This is expected to prevent new strains of cVDPV2 from arising and allow eventual cessation of WPV2 vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} {{challenges are}} found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most polio infections are asymptomatic or result in minor symptoms, with less than 1% of infections leading to paralysis and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen. And since 2000, {{there have been a}} number of outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine, which have raised the necessity of eventually switching to the more expensive inactivated polio vaccine. The risk of vaccine-derived polio will persist long after the switch to <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine,</b> since a small number of chronic excretors continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral vaccine.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} vaccine that is effective for hantavirus. A vaccine known as Hantavax has been under study since 1990. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 3 trial stage. This <b>inactivated</b> <b>vaccine</b> is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses like the Puumala (PUUV) virus. There is no FDA approved vaccine available and a killed-virus vaccine is not being pursued because of the dangers associated with mass production under high containment {{as well as the}} unresolved questions about the efficiency of the vaccine. However, a number of labs have been working towards a vaccine that would deliver viral antigens by either DNA vectors or as recombinant proteins. While these recombinant vaccines are being developed they are not currently available nor will they be in the near future.|$|E

2500|$|Natural {{immunity}} from maternal antibodies lasts in the kitten {{from three to}} nine weeks. [...] After that, kittens are susceptible to FCV. [...] Previous infection does not guarantee lifelong immunity, since an antigenically dissimilar FCV (such as VS-FCV) can cause infection. [...] However, usually {{after the age of}} three years, FCV infections are mild or asymptomatic. [...] FCV vaccination will not always prevent disease, but can reduce the severity. [...] FCV vaccines come in two types, inactivated (ATCvet code: [...] ) and attenuated (live, but not virulent; in various combination vaccines). [...] They {{have been shown to be}} effective for at least three years. [...] Attenuated FCV vaccine has been shown to possibly cause mild upper respiratory infection. <b>Inactivated</b> <b>vaccine</b> does not, but it causes more local inflammation and possibly predisposes the cat to vaccine-associated sarcoma. [...] The only vaccine licensed for prevention of VS-FCV is CaliciVax, manufactured by Fort Dodge Animal Health, a division of Wyeth. [...] It also contains a strain of the traditional FCV virus. [...] Since VS-FCV has arisen from variant strains of FCV, it is not certain that a vaccine for one virulent strain will protect against all virulent strains.|$|E

The nucleotide similarity of the partial N and G genes ranged from 97. 1 to 99. 4 % and from 91. 8 to 100 % among rabies vaccine strains, respectively, indicating that each manufacturer used different rabies virus strains to produce their vaccines.
