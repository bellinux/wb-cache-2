In order to apply monodrome modal algorithm control (MMAC) to nano feed system having large time-lag, A new step by step fitting method by the experimental results to confirm model parameters of control system was presented, and the characteristics of control system was analyzed. Simulation results show that there is periodic error generated by model building, when the number of terms (N) adopted in predicative modal of non-parametric and monotonic is lesser, i. e. little N generated periodic error and there is a lager error when the sampling point are near N� 2 N� 3 N, but with the increasing of number of terms (N), error becomes little, so comprehensive information and error depend on the number of term (N).

40|$|Material-saving and {{energy-saving}} {{belong to}} the basic requirements imposed on contemporary manufacturing processes. The realization of these processes gives measurable profi ts, not only economical but also ecological. In the case of wood sawing with circular saw blades, material and energy-savings are dependent on total overall set of teeth (theoretical kerf) and teeth position accuracy {{in relation to the}} workpiece. Hence, it is necessary to achieve a decrease of both raw material and energy losses by the use of narrow-kerf saw blades, an increase of sawing accuracy, as well as a reduction of spacing in case of sawing with a gang of circular saws. However, meeting these requirements in the case of rip sawing with circular saw blades is a quite diffi cult issue and depends on many factors. The detailed analyses concerning ways of chip transportation in the kerf slot, saw blade stiffness, saw blade movement and workpiece <b>feeding</b> <b>accuracy</b> are the proof of these inconvenient technical problems in sawmills. Hence, the realization of economical wood sawing with circular saw blades seems not to be viable until the whole system of sawing fulfils the defined requirements. Thanks to the application of the proecological technology (circular saw blades of a new design), in the examined industrial case, the following results have been achieved: an increase of about 18 % in the amount of side lumber, roughly 16 % less sawdust (as an effect of kerf reduction) and about 16 % lower values of the cutting power consumption...|$|E
40|$|The visual {{environment}} of several aquaculture species {{has been shown}} to be crucial for increased survival and growth. However, very little is known about the visual system of the increasingly popular Seriola genus and its developmental changes. We investigated the ontogenetic changes in colour vision and spatial resolution in the yellowtail kingfish, S. lalandi and discuss them in relation to past behavioural feeding experiments. Microspectrophotometry was used to measure the spectral sensitivities of photoreceptor visual pigments in larvae and sub-adults. The yellowtail kingfish larva has a broad spectral range including ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS) single cones, middle-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) single cones, MWS twin cones and long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) twin cones. The overall spectral range narrows during development through the loss of the LWS twin cones and a general short-wavelength shift in the spectral sensitivities of the other photoreceptor types. As a sub-adult the yellowtail kingfish also gains a short-wave-sensitive (SWS) single cone. This suggests that different lighting conditions will be optimal for larvae and sub-adults. No changes are observed in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) distribution between juveniles and sub-adults. A temporal concentric increase in RGC density and a weak horizontal band of medium RGC density (30 % of the peak density) are present at both stages. This suggests that no changes in the feeding behaviour will occur throughout growth although the sub-adult possesses 1. 6 times higher spatial resolution which would increase <b>feeding</b> <b>accuracy</b> at higher pellet densities.

At the onset of Experiment 1, the animals were first-calf heifers pregnant to an Ab bull and in Experiment 2 second-calf cows pregnant to a Hereford bull. In both experiments, four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arranged design consisted of the two breeds and two feeding accuracies, (Accurate and Inaccurate; A and IA). In Experiment 1, the day-to-day variation in the roughage offered ranged up to ± 40 %. In Experiment 2, the same variation was used in two weeks periods. Forage consisted of grass silage and hay, additionally straw in Experiment 2. Milled barley was offered to the cows pre and post partum. The objective was to {{study the effects of}} treatments on cow feed intake, live weight, body condition, milk production, dystocia, fertility and calf performance. In addition, the achieved feeding level for non-mature beef-dairy crosses was evaluated. In Experiment 1, the AbAy and ChAy cows received daily during the entire indoor period an average 73. 1 and 81. 6; in Experiment 2, 89. 1 and 92. 2 MJ ME, respectively. In both experiments, variation of roughages offered had only minor effects on cow performance. Reproduction was not affected by the <b>feeding</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Treatments had no effect on milk production, which averaged 10. 8 and 12. 6 kg/d in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The milk protein content of the ChAy cows was higher (p< 0. 01) than that of the AbAy cows (Exp. 1 : 32. 7 vs. 31. 0 g/kg, Exp. 2 : 31. 9 vs. 29. 3 g/kg). The dystocial cases observed were not related to the treatments. In Experiment 1, calves on diet IA tended to grow better pre-weaning than those on diet A (p= 0. 08, 1325 vs. 1296 g/d). In both experiments, live weight gain pre-weaning was better for males than for females (Exp. 1 : 1398 vs. 1224 g/d, p< 0. 05 and Exp. 2 : 1453 vs. 1295 g/d, p< 0. 05). Accurate feeding is not necessary for young beef-dairy crosses if the total amount of feed, and thus energy offered over a period of a few weeks, is adequate to fulfill the energy requirements.

High-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) was used to further analyse P-CTX- 1 of ciguatera toxins in the samples identified as positive by the mouse bioassay. The mouse bioassay showed that ciguatoxic fish existed in all six sampling sites, and 47. 8 % of the samples were confirmed to be contaminated with CTXs. The implicated species largely belonged to Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, Holocentridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Retrospective infant feeding {{data are}} {{important}} to the study of child and adult health patterns. The accuracy of maternal recall of past infant feeding events was examined and specifically the infant's age when breast feeding was stopped and formula feeding and solid foods were introduced. DESIGN AND SETTING [...] The sample consisted of Bedouin Arab women (n = 318) living in the Negev in Israel who were a part of a larger cohort participating in a prospective study of infant health and who were delivered of their infants between July 1 and December 15, 1981. Data from interviews conducted 12 and 18 months postpartum were compared to the standard data collected six months postpartum. MAIN RESULTS [...] As length of recall increased there was a small increase in the mean difference, and its standard deviation, between the standard and recalled age when breast feeding was stopped and formula feeding and solid foods were started. Recall on formula feeding was less accurate than recall on solid foods and breast feeding. In particular, among those 61 % reporting formula use at the six month interview, 51 % did not recall introducing formula when interviewed at 18 months. The odds ratio (95 % CI) of stunting versus normal length for age for formula fed versus breast fed infants based on recall data (OR = 2. 07; 95 % CI 0. 82 - 5. 22) differed only slightly from those based on the standard data (OR = 2. 21; 95 % CI 0. 77 - 6. 37). The accuracy of a mother's recall varied with her child's nutritional status {{at the time of the}} interview, but not with other sociodemographic, infant, or interviewer characteristics.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{about cutting}} temperature have been reported, {{because of the}} great influence of a tool face temperature on a tool wear. However, there is few report about cutting heat. The cutting conditions (cutting speed, <b>feed,</b> etc.) and <b>accuracy</b> of temperature measurement in recent cutting are quite different {{from those in the}} past. In case of cutting a material like aluminum, for instance, the cutting speed is usually adopted as 1000 m/min much higher than that in the past. The behavior of cutting heat (heat into chip, work and tool) in high speed cutting has been investigated applying theory and experiment methods in the present study. The heat generated in the cutting process is distributed to three parts such as main shear plane, rake face and clearance face. In this experiment, the work materials are AISI 1045 steeland Aluminum alloy A 5052, and each cutting speed is up to 400 m/min and 850 m/min. The cutting heat are measured by accurate thermometers at different depths of cut and flank contact lengths. In addition, the heat ratio of chip, work and tool is calculated from theory. Experimental data are similar to theoretical results. Results of this research show that higher the cutting speed, higher the percentage of heat into the chip and lower the percentage of heat in the tool and work.

The yield measurement methods are under developing for other harvesting machines, e. g. forage harvesters, mowing machines, potato, sugar beet, cotton and tomato harvesters etc. The function principles of systems based on weighing trailers or round balers are described as well. Two methods of the mowing machine material feed rate measurement were developed and tested. The measurements carried out proved that a very good linear relationship existed between the conditioner's power input, output frequency of the apparatus measuring impact force {{by means of the}} impact plate, and material feed rate through the mowing machine.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{machining}} parameters {{as they relate to}} the quality characteristics of machined features. Two most important quality characteristics are set as the dimensional accuracy and the surface roughness. Before any newly acquired machine tool is put to use for production, it is important to test the machine in a systematic way to find out how different parameter settings affect machining quality. The empirical verification was made by conducting a Design of Experiment (DOE) with 3 levels and 3 factors on a state-of-the-art Cincinnati Hawk Arrow 750 Vertical Machining Center (VMC). Data analysis revealed that the significant factor was the Hardness of the material and the significant interaction effect was the Hardness + <b>Feed</b> for dimensional <b>accuracy,</b> while the significant factor was Speed for surface roughness. Since the equally important thing is the capability of the instruments from which the quality characteristics are being measured, a comparison was made between the VMC touch probe readings and the measurements from a Mitutoyo coordinate measuring machine (CMM) on bore diameters. A machine mounted touch probe has gained a wide acceptance in recent years, as it is more suitable for the modern manufacturing environment. The data vindicated that the VMC touch probe has the capability that is suitable for the production environment.

40|$|Tri-axial {{accelerometer}} tags provide {{quantitative data}} on body movement {{that can be}} used to characterize behaviour and understand species ecology in ways that would otherwise be impossible. Using tags on wild terrestrial mammals, especially smaller species, in natural settings has been limited. Poor battery power also reduced the amount of data collected, which limits what can be derived about animal behaviour. Another challenge using wild animals, is acquiring observations of actual behaviours with which to compare tag data and create an adequate training set to reliably identify behavioural states. Brown hares were fitted with accelerometers for 5 weeks to evaluate their use in collecting detailed behaviour data and activity levels. Collared hares were filmed to associate actual behaviours with tag data. Observed behaviours were classified using Random Forests (ensemble learning method) to create a supervised model and then used to classify hare behaviour from the tags. Increased tag longevity allowed acquisition of large quantities of data from each individual and direct observation of tagged hare's behaviour. Random Forests accurately classified observed behaviours from tag data with an 11 % error rate. Individual accuracy of behaviours varied with running (100 % <b>accuracy),</b> <b>feeding</b> (94. 7 %) and vigilance (98. 3 %) having the highest classification accuracy. Hares spent 46 % of their time being vigilant and 25 % feeding when active. The combination of our tags and Random Forests facilitated large amounts of behavioural data to be collected on animals where observational studies could be limited, or impossible. The same method could be used on a range of terrestrial mammals to create models to investigate behaviour from tag data, to learn more about their behaviour and be used to answer many ecological questions. However, further development of methods for analysing tag data is needed to make the process quicker, simpler and more accurate...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{existing}} British National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) {{safety guideline}} recommends testing the pH of nasogastric (NG) tube aspirates. Feeding is considered safe if a pH of 5. 5 or lower has been observed; otherwise chest X-rays are recommended. Our previous research found that at 5. 5, the pH test lacks sensitivity towards oesophageal placements, a major risk identified by feeding experts. The {{aim of this}} research is to use a decision analytic modelling approach to systematically assess the safety of the pH test under cut-offs 1 - 9. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We mapped out the care pathway according to the existing safety guideline where the pH test is used as a first-line test, followed by chest x-rays. Decision outcomes were scored on a 0 - 100 scale in terms of safety. Sensitivities and specificities of the pH test at each cut-off were extracted from our previous research. Aggregating outcome scores and probabilities resulted in weighted scores which enabled an analysis of the relative safety of the checking procedure under various pH cut-offs. RESULTS: The pH test was the safest under cut-off 5 when there was ≥ 30 % of NG tube misplacements. Under cut-off 5, respiratory feeding was excluded; oesophageal feeding was kept to a minimum to balance the need of chest X-rays for patients with a pH higher than 5. Routine chest X-rays were less safe than the pH test while to feed all without safety checks was the most risky. DISCUSSION: The safety of the current checking procedure is sensitive to the choice of pH cut-offs, the impact of <b>feeding</b> delays, the <b>accuracy</b> of the pH in the oesophagus, as well as the extent of tube misplacements. CONCLUSIONS: The pH test with 5 as the cut-off was the safest overall.

However, preparation of the markers to be administered and analytical procedures used for marker content determination are time-consuming thus strongly limiting the number of animals involved in the experiments. In this paper, polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 6000 da) was tested as a faecal marker. Four trials were conducted on dry, non-lactating ewes kept in digestibility crates that allowed individual measurements. The overall experiment was designed to assess the major factors that could lessen the effectiveness of this method, assuming that the use of grab samples of faeces is sufficient. Trial 1 was designed to test two levels of PEG (20 and 40 g/day) administered in two equal amounts. Trial 2 was designed to test the effect of either a single morning (0800 h) dose (20 g/day) or a twice daily administration (0800 and 1600 h) of the same fractionated dose. Trial 3 was designed to test a 20 g/day dose of PEG administered once daily to ewes fed with hays of different qualities: medium (MH) and low (LH). In trial 4, a lower dose of PEG (10 g/day) was administered once a day to ewes fed with fresh oat-vetch forage. It was demonstrated that PEG could be precisely estimated (average prediction error 53. 47 g/kg) with near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). On the basis of the four trials, it has been proved that PEG administration (20 and 40 g/day) did not significantly affect the DMI of ewes fed dry diets (trials 1, 2 and 3), whereas there was an unexpected increase of DMI for ewes fed exclusively with green feed (trial 4) without DM digestibility modification. Providing PEG as a single dose (0800 h) or split into two equal parts (0800 and 1600 h) did not alter the estimated DMI. Considering the interest of grab sampling, there were clear variations of PEG in faeces with higher concentrations observed at 0800 and 1600 h and lower concentrations at 1400 h. Consequently, with PEG (measured with NIRS) administered once and using the grab sampling procedure (morning collection), it is possible to estimate the DMI of dry <b>feeds</b> with good <b>accuracy.</b> For green <b>feeds,</b> more research is needed as the estimated results are still highly variable.

40|$|Grazing is {{the most}} {{economical}} feeding scheme for ruminants. Grazing management, however, is often difficult for breeders, particularly {{because of a lack}} of knowledge about grass availability and quality. There are methods for assessing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of grass, but they are difficult to apply in the case of grazing ruminants. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is based on the absorption of infrared light by organic matters to provide NIRS spectra. These NIRS spectra can be correlated with the chemical or biological composition of samples in order to develop calibrations that can be used as predictive models. The primary objective of this PhD thesis was to study the potential of NIRS applied to faeces (FNIRS) in order to predict the characteristics of the diets of grazing herbivores. The particular focus was on the in vivo organic matter digestibility, voluntary intake and botanical composition of ingested diets. The main results of the study show that FNIRS has great portential for estimating in vivo digestibility and voluntary intake by grazing ruminants and that faeces are a good indicator of ingested diets. Based on both large or small and varied databases, the results suggest that FNIRS spectral libraries could be developed for characterising ruminant <b>feed</b> intake. The <b>accuracy</b> of the FNIRS models in estimating in vivo digestibility and voluntary intake is similar to or better than that of other methods usually used to assess these parameters. FNIRS could also be used to predict ruminants’ diet composition in terms of plant species. These predictions should be used only for ranking, however, because of the current lack of accurate procedures for determining diet selection individually. NIRS applied to faeces can be used to predict the in vivo characteristics of forage with sufficient accuracy. The prediction error of NIRS calibrations depends on the accuracy and precision of the reference data. The prediction of in vivo digestibility and intake is sufficiently repeatable compared with the procedure using the reference method. Intake is more difficult to predict with sufficient precision and is more closely linked to animal variability and to uncertainty of the FNIRS models. The major difficulty in using this method lies in generating the diet-faecal pairs as reliably as possible. FNIRS calibrations for predicting in vivo diet characteristics are derivative calibrations. The sample analysed for reference values (diet samples) differs from the samples submitted to NIRS analyses (faeces). With regard to research on forages, in vivo trials with animals confined in pens or digestibility crates appears to be the best reference method for generating FNIRS calibrations. Future work will involve developing FNIRS calibrations for predicting independent datasets and using them to create decision-support tools for improving diverse grazing management schemes. The major focus should be to compare different feeding strategies rather than to obtain an exact estimate of feed intake values. As a low-cost and rapid prediction technique, FNIRS could contribute significantly to the development of a methodology that would help improve our knowledge of forage and animal variability...|$|R
40|$|Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) {{is one of}} {{the major}} farmed fish species, with main {{production}} in Asia, South and Central America that can tolerate a wide range of environmental stress and easily adapt with low quality of feed ingredients. The aims of the experiments were to determine effects of feeding frequency on utilization of protein and energy in Nile tilapia, to quantify differences in excretion of ammonia and ammonium in Nile tilapia fed the same daily ration, distributed over 2 and 4 meals a day. The aims were derived from a hypothesis that frequent feeding facilitates higher overlap in absorption of crystalline dietary amino acid supplement and protein-bound amino acids, since digestion of protein requires time and thereby may improve utilization of dietary protein. Significant differences were indicated for P< 0. 05. The fish were kept in indoors rearing tank (70 × 50 × 50 cm) with equal water flow (180 l h- 1) supplied with freshwater from a recirculation system. Each tank contained 30 tilapias (mean weight ± SEM; 721 ± 0. 1 g) with an average weight of individual fish 24 g. All tanks had 24 h d- 1 light. The water temperature and dissolved oxygen were recorded on a daily basis. The average water temperature was 27. 5 °C with 7. 5 mg l- 1 dissolved oxygen and pH 7 during the experimental period. The fish were fed for 46 days One plant ingredient based diet was prepared with 31 % crude protein, 37 % starch and 6 % fat in the dry matter. There were two different feeding regimes. One was only twice in a day (at 10 : 00 and 20 : 00) and the other was four times per day (at 08 : 00, 12 : 00, 16 : 00 and 20 : 00). Each meal lasted for 70 min when the fish were fed 2 meals d- 1, and 35 min for 4 meals d- 1. In three reference tanks feeding was twice per day to satiation level, and the fish in the remaining tanks were pair-fed 90 % of the dry matter consumed by the fish fed to appetite the previous day. No significant differences were found for growth performance, body composition, or feed conversion ratio when the fish received 90 % of appetite level in 2 or 4 meals. However, liver weight in percent of whole body weight was significantly higher for 2 than 4 meals. Feeding the fish to satiation in 2 meals resulted in higher feed intake, and lower protein and energy retentions than feeding 90 % of satiation in 2 meals. Ammonium (NH 4 +), ammonia (NH 3), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite (NO 2 -) were measured one hour before the last meal (19 : 00) and every 2 hours after last meal (22 : 00; 00 : 00; 02 : 00; 04 : 00; 06 : 00) over night at days of 14, 26 and 39. During this measurement water samples were collected from the inlet and outlet of tanks. At the end of the experiment (day 45) nitrogenous catabolites were allowed to accumulate in a stagnant system (water flow closed), following the same sampling intervals as described for the run-through sampling approach. From the flow-through system, significant differences were observed between feeding frequency, time interval and their interaction in all parameters (TAN, ammonium, ammonia) at days 14, 26 and 39. Similarly, significant differences were seen for nitrite measurement at different period of time. However, no significant difference was seen for feeding frequency and the interaction between feeding frequency and measurement at different period. In the flow-through system, the highest TAN was found at 4 hours after feeding in 2 meals (90 % and appetitive) while for 4 meals (90 %) it was at 2 hours after feeding during all the sampling days. The maximum TAN at 588 µg l- 1 water was measured at day 39 in 2 meals (appetitive), 4 h after feeding. The lowest value at 89 µg l- 1 was measured at day 14 in 4 meals (90 %), 10 h after last feeding in the day. TAN was consistently highest for to 2 meals (appetitive) and lowest for 4 meals (90 %). The TAN excretion started immediately after feeding, then reached peak value, and thereafter gradually declined to the based level. Nitrite accumulation did not follow any particular pattern in the flow-through system, bur tended to reach peak value 2 hours after <b>feeding.</b> The <b>accuracy</b> of the results obtained from the stagnant system was high, and metabolic nitrogen excretion (with or without values for nitrite) over time was described (R 2 = 0. 98 - 0. 99) by 3 rd degree polynomial patterns. Maximum nitrogen excretion, with nitrite was maximum at 4. 59, 4. 61 and 2. 88 h after feeding in 2 meals (appetitive), 2 meals (90 %) and 4 meals (90 %) respectively. The estimates without nitrite included showed maxima at 4. 59, 3. 64 and 4. 02 h after feeding in 2 meals (appetitive), 2 meals (90 %) and 4 meals (90 %) successively. NO 2 -, which was not a catabolite increased linearly over time. A probable reason for the observed increase in nitrite may be oxidation of TAN from metabolism and/or microbial oxidation of nitrogen in intestinal contents and faeces. The nitrogen excretion rate over gills (not including excretion of urea via the kidneys) 4 h after last feeding was the highest (150 µmoles (kg body weight (BW) * h) - 1) for 2 meals (90 %) and the lowest (113 µmoles (kg BW * h) - 1) for 4 meals (90 %). Whereas for 2 meals (appetitive) showed very close value 145 µmoles (kg body weight * h) - 1 to 2 meals (90 %). Meanwhile, 2 meals (appetitive) reached at peak (149 µmoles (kg BW * h) - 1) at 6 h after last feeding and the lowest (88 µmoles (kg BW * h) - 1) for 4 meals (90 %). Therefore, it was seen in all the observations that the maximum level of nitrogen excretion was found in 2 meals (appetitive) and lowest in 4 meals (90 %). In conclusion, there were no significant differences in weight gain, feed utilization, body composition, protein and energy retention between 2 and 4 meals restricted. However, nitrogen excretion peak values were significantly higher in 2 meals (90 %) than 4 meals (90 %), indicating that the 4 meals (90 %) feeding regime facilitated better water quality and thereby a better environment for the fish.
