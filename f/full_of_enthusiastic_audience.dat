50|$|In Georgia and Russia Yovanna {{is still}} {{considered}} a living legend. In 2011 during a solemn ceremony at the Rustaveli National Theatre the Mayor of Tbilisi bestowed honorary citizenship on Yovanna. In 2017 the Georgian Ambassador in Greece awarded Yovanna with a state certificate of appreciation in recognition of her extraordinary contribution to strengthening history ties between Georgian and Greek Peoples.

50|$|Another novelty was {{the musical}} {{performance}} at the opening ceremony, while signing the song performed by Kaushiki Desikan and Monali Thakur, Shantanu Moitra in presence <b>of</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b> A concert with emphasis {{on the effects of}} the composition of Rabindra Nath Tagore's foreign songs provided a melodic end to the program.|$|R
50|$|Informed presenters {{like the}} late Peter Clayton and Charles Fox served jazz superbly, and were looked on with real affection. For many years a long {{procession}} of bands, in all styles, {{made their way}} to the BBC's Maida Vale studios to record jazz, often in a near gig setting in front <b>of</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|R
50|$|Much of the charity's work {{involves}} teaming {{children with}} a volunteer theatre professional to write short plays, which are performed by professional actors in front <b>of</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audiences</b> and provide the {{children with a}}n experience of success, pride and increased self-esteem.

5000|$|Live at SO36 {{was made}} [...] "CD of the week" [...] by Alster Radio but was {{negatively}} {{received by the}} music review website 'Laut.de' which gave it 2 out of 5 stars.

60|$|Leaving a {{grateful}} souvenir {{in the box}} intended to receive whatever guests choose to leave, the girls descended in the morning sunshine, finding it a very different experience from the ascent. All was clear and calm now,--beautiful and grand; and only pausing at M. to send back a fine engraving to the comely priest, who had made a deep impression on their romantic hearts, the enfants returned to their anxious friends, mildewed, rumpled, and weary, but <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> delight over their successful ascent of St. Bernard.|$|R
25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was shouting over the cheers <b>of</b> his <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience,</b> but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} vital matches in the 1993-94 season, {{but perhaps the}} most {{important}} game for Silkeborg was the tournament's third round match at home against Brøndby. Just before the game, the team's big name Jakob Kjeldberg had been sold to Chelsea, and when Brøndby put themselves ahead 2-0 early in the game, it looked difficult for the home team. But Silkeborg totally turned the match upside down and won 4-2 in front <b>of</b> an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b> During the rest of the fall SIF delivered one attractive game after another. The team lost only two of 18 matches and could overwinter in the first place of the Danish Superliga.|$|R
5000|$|On All About Jazz Marc Medwin said [...] "Trio X {{continues}} its increasingly longstanding tradition of meditative fire music with this stridently contemplative March 2006 live date. Not {{so much a}} series of pieces as a collective meditation on Black music and its history, the album is a palimpsest, bringing together various eras and styles in front <b>of</b> an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b> ...the disc is another triumph for the group, {{maybe one of the}} most interesting and enjoyable statements in its growing catalogue". in JazzTimes Scott Verrastro wrote [...] "Roulette at Location One exhibits Trio X in peak form, opting for spatial exploration by utilizing remarkable restraint and extraordinary dynamics".|$|R
50|$|At {{the urging}} of some friends, I decided to go the {{briefing}} in Dallas. I did not expect much, but when I arrived, I found a packed arena, <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> individuals hearing great speakers. I went to the phone {{after the first few}} hours, called Nancy wife, and said, ‘Get a baby-sitter for the children. You must come up here and hear what is going on.’ She flew to Dallas, and we had the opportunity to attend together. This was the first time either of us had met Ronald Reagan. businesswoman Mary Crowley invited us to a reception for him at the Hyatt. Jimmy Carter had been invited to speak but did not attend.|$|R
5000|$|The dismal results caused Gephardt to {{drop out}} and later endorse Kerry. Carol Moseley Braun also dropped out, {{endorsing}} Howard Dean. Besides the impact of coming in third, Dean was further hurt by a speech he gave at a post-caucus rally. Dean was shouting over the cheers <b>of</b> his <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience,</b> but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.The incessant replaying of the [...] "Dean Scream" [...] by the press became a debate {{on the topic of}} whether Dean was the victim of media bias. The scream scene was shown approximately 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days following the incident, a number that does not include talk shows and local news broadcasts. However, those who were in the actual audience that day insist that they were not aware of the infamous [...] "scream" [...] until they returned to their hotel rooms and saw it on TV.|$|R
50|$|Currently, My Excuse {{is in the}} US and has {{successfully}} completed their Kickstarter project funding while preparing for their Spring Tour in the US and Canada. A total 135 backers helped fund the tour, pledging a total $10,592. Most of the funds - about three-quarters of it - came from Greeks in the United States. The successful accomplishment of My Excuse funding project on Kickstarter led the organizational board to invite the band as speakers on a panel during the conference. On February 15 My Excuse spoke at MMC unveiling secrets of a successful Kickstarter project. During {{the second day of}} MMC the band performed at Gullifty's Underground in front <b>of</b> an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> and media reporters. After the group's show, audience members kept approaching the band, buying CDs, asking for autographs and raving about how their show was the best they had seen at Millennium. Several said they had not seen a band at Millennium do such a great performance since Halestorm - a band which just won a Grammy award. Playing in Harrisburg is an opportunity for My Excuse to leave barriers at home. In Greece, the group faces a musical and cultural barrier, rather than a language one.|$|R

Later on in his career he gradually abandoned his pessimistic prose and chose to write more and more poetry <b>full</b> <b>of</b> historical and literary references, while at the same time not neglecting the sound value of his verse. These two factors have gradually alienated him from an initially <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|R
