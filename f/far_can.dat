[...] Kumudam gave the film a lukewarm review: [...] "Though the story is ordinary, the shocking events inserted into the narrative are something new to the Tamil cinema." [...] The magazine criticised the film's songs and length, saying that its time period was inconsistent: [...] "In a scene, there is a wall clock in the King's office, whereas he is writing with a feather-pen."
