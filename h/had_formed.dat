Darwin's Journal was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.|$|E

5|$|Abul Ala {{was born}} in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nuʿman, Syria, {{near the city of}} Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He {{was a member of the}} Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Maʿarra, {{belonging}} to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly two}} weeks of inactivity, an area of {{disturbed}} weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two {{on the evening of}} June 28, and, two hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, at which point the system was named Bret. This {{was the first time that}} two tropical storms <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
25|$|The moons of Saturn are {{typically}} thought to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> through co-accretion, {{a similar process}} to that believed to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. However, a proposed model on the formation of Titan suggests that Titan was instead formed {{in a series of}} giant impacts between pre-existing moons. Iapetus and Rhea are thought to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> from part of the debris of these collisions. More-recent studies, however, suggest that all of Saturn's moons inward of Titan are no more than 100 million years old; thus, Iapetus is unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> in the same series of collisions as Rhea and all the other moons inward of Titan, and—along with Titan—may be a primordial satellite.|$|R

5|$|Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project {{encouraged}} {{organization and}} the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land claims were recognized in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act did the pipeline progress.|$|E
5|$|And others again, whom God <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> {{with mild}} and gentle dispositions, think it {{necessary}} to put a force upon their own tempers, by acting a noisy, violent, malicious part, {{as a means to}} be distinguished.

5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and warmth, {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who <b>had</b> <b>formed</b> attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to {{put himself}} {{in a position where}} his control might be challenged as it had been in Cleveland.

Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager.
