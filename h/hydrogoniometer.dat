40|$|BACKGROUND: Goniometric {{measurements}} of hemiplegic arm joints must be reliable to draw proper clinical and scientific conclusions. Previous reliability studies were cross-sectional {{and based on}} small samples. Knowledge about the contributions of sources of variation to these measurement results is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the interobserver reliability of {{measurements of}} passive range of motion (PROM) over time, explore sources of variation associated with these measurement results, and generate smallest detectable differences for clinical decision making. DESIGN: This investigation was a measurement-focused study with a longitudinal design, nested within a 2 -arm randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Two trained physical therapists assessed 7 arm movements at baseline and after 4, 8, and 20 weeks in 48 people with subacute stroke using a standardized protocol. One physical therapist performed the passive movement, and the other read the <b>hydrogoniometer.</b> The therapists then switched roles. The relative contributions of several sources of variation to error variance were explored with analysis of variance. RESULTS: /b> Interobserver reliability coefficients ranged from. 89 to. 97. The PROM measurements were influenced by error variance ranging from 31 % to 50 %. The participant Ã— time interaction made the largest contribution to error variance, ranging from 59 % to 81 %. Smallest detectable differences were 6 to 22 degrees and were largest for shoulder movements. Limitations Verification of shoulder pain and hypertonia as sources of error variance led to a substantial number of unstable variance components, necessitating a simpler analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of PROM with a standardized protocol, a <b>hydrogoniometer,</b> and 2 trained physical therapists yielded high interobserver reliability indexes for all arm movements. Error variance made a large contribution to the variation in measurement results. The resulting smallest detectable differences can be used to interpret future hemiplegic arm PROM measurements with more confidence. PMID: 22577062 doi: 10. 2522 /ptj. 2011028...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} a contracture preventive positioning procedure for the hemiplegic arm in subacute stroke patients in addition to conventional physio- and occupational therapy. DESIGN: A single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient neurological units from three rehabilitation centres in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Nineteen subacute stroke patients (minus two drop-outs) with a severe motor deficit of the arm. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects underwent conventional rehabilitation care. Nine subjects additionally received a positioning procedure for two 30 -min sessions a day, five days a week, for five weeks. MAIN MEASURES: Passive range of motion of five arm movements using a <b>hydrogoniometer</b> and resistance to passive movement at the elbow using the Ashworth Scale. Secondary outcome measures were pain at the end range of passive motions, the arm section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Barthel Index scores for ADL-independence. Outcome measures were taken after five weeks and additional measurements after 10 weeks by two assessors blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: Comparison of the experimental (n = 9) with the control subjects (n = 8) after five weeks showed that additional positioning significantly slowed down development of shoulder abduction contracture (P = 0. 042, - 5. 3 degrees versus - 23 degrees). No other {{differences were found between the}} groups. CONCLUSIONS: Applying a contracture preventive positioning procedure for the hemiplegic arm slowed down the development of shoulder abduction contracture. Positioning did not show significant additional value on other outcome measures. Since the sample size was small, results of this study need future verification. status: publishe...|$|E
