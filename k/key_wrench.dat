50|$|Klein Tools {{was founded}} in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German {{immigrant}} Mathias Klein. The first tool Klein made {{was a pair of}} side-cutting pliers for a telegraph lineman. The company grew as the telegraph and eventually telephone and electrical industries grew after the Civil War by adding 100 types of pliers in the 1910s. From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, hex <b>key</b> <b>wrenches,</b> screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors. Along the way, Klein acquired the R.H. Buhrke Company of Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1968 and the Vaco Products Company of Jonesville, Michigan in 1986. Also in the mid 1980s, the company started manufacturing adjustable wrenches in the US, which they had previously been purchasing from a Japanese supplier.|$|R
5000|$|Explained by the {{geographical}} and commercial {{history of the}} drive type's development, the term [...] "hex key“ {{is best known as}} Allen in the USA (The “Allen” name is a registered trademark, originated by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut circa 1910, and currently owned by Apex Tool Group, LLC), INBUS in Germany (The term “INBUS” is a registered trademark, originated by the German company Bauer & Schaurte in 1934 and currently owned by INBUS IP GmbH, Breckerfeld, Germany) and Unbrako <b>key</b> or <b>wrench</b> in Scandinavia. The synonym zeta <b>key</b> or <b>wrench</b> refers to the sixth letter of the Greek alphabet. The term hex-head is sometimes used to refer to this type of drive, but this use is not consistent with its more conventional use referring to external-wrenching hexagons.|$|R
5000|$|A hex key, Allen <b>key</b> or Allen <b>wrench</b> {{is a tool}} used {{to drive}} bolts and screws with {{hexagonal}} sockets in their heads.|$|R
50|$|In single player, {{the player}} drives {{around one of}} the four cities, {{collecting}} Dare Devil coins. If all Dare Devil coins in a level are collected, the player unlocks a secret car. What also can be collected are <b>keys</b> and <b>wrenches</b> that open up bonus missions. After winning a bonus mission, the player can unlock a paint job for the car used.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a hexagon socket head hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special <b>keys</b> or <b>wrenches</b> for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
2500|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an allen <b>key</b> or <b>wrench.</b> A manual knockout punch can handle holes from [...] The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to [...] in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel. A hydraulic system is much bulkier and heavier than the other systems {{but it is the}} easiest to use and can make holes up to [...] in diameter. It is a two piece system where the dies are attached to the ram which is connected to the hydraulic unit via a flexible hose.|$|R
50|$|The {{manual system}} uses a screw {{that has a}} {{standard}} hex head or square head and is driven using an allen <b>key</b> or <b>wrench.</b> A manual knockout punch can handle holes from 0.5 to 1.25 in. The ratchet system has a custom ratcheting wrench that uses a ball screw to make the process faster and easier. This type of system has a mechanical advantage of approximately 220:1 and can punch holes up to 3 in in diameter in 10 gauge mild steel.

50|$|The FCS {{system was}} {{designed}} by Brian A. Whitty in Elanora, Australia, and patented on November 7, 1995. It can be recognized by the 2 tabs on the fins which are designed {{to fit into a}} securing plug that attaches the fin to the board. The fin tabs are placed in slots which are set into the board by the use of a plug that fits flush with the underside of the board. They are secured into these plugs by the use of set screws which can be tightened down by a fin <b>key</b> or Allen <b>wrench.</b> The plug design and use of set screws enables the fin to be easily removed and installed for storage or travel.|$|R
50|$|By February 1888, Barbour was {{residing}} at King William-street in Adelaide, South Australia {{as reported}} in the local Police Gazette. He had items stolen from his bicycle at his residence, “two bicycle <b>keys,</b> a <b>wrench,</b> and an oilcan.”Barbour secured a position as chemist at the pharmaceutical manufacturing firm, F. H. Faulding & Co. He rose to the rank of senior chemist. Eucalyptus oil was a key component in the product line at Faulding and in 1892 Barbour developed a test method to determine the eucalyptol concentration of eucalyptus oil. The Barbour test method became a standard in the industry and in 1893 was listed in the British Pharmacopoeia.On 8 January 1895, Barbour presented a paper {{at a meeting of the}} Pharmaceutical Society of Australia where he proposed standards for eucalyptol concentrations in eucalyptus oil and mentioned the Faulding process. He proposed limits on the specific gravity of eucalyptol and eucalyptus oil.While at Faulding & Co., Barbour went on holiday to America and England. He visited Leeds, his hometown, where he purchased two Crookes tubes from Reynolds and Branson. In April 1896, Barbour returned to Adelaide.|$|R
60|$|All these {{particulars}} {{he remembered}} {{in that moment}} of agony, and resolved {{what he would do}} to overcome the difficulties which they threw in his way. Having passed through the gate, he dropped his now senseless companion beneath the shelter of the wall, and passing his hands through the bars, turned the key and locked it. He then took out a short hunting-knife which he wore, and passing that also through the bars of the gate, he inserted it in the handle of the <b>key,</b> and then <b>wrenching</b> it round with all his force, broke the key in the wards: all the smiths in Poitou could not have locked the gate closer, or made it more impossible to open it.|$|R
2500|$|Drummers use a drum key for tuning their {{drums and}} {{adjusting}} some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum <b>key</b> (a T-handled <b>wrench)</b> {{there are various}} tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums [...] "by ear" [...] or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which [...] "measures tympanic pressure" [...] on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally the soundbox, or resonator, and a surmounting yoke in {{the shape}} of an {{inverted}} U (see picture of player), were carved as a single unit from a block of maple or sycamore. The soundboard, or belly, a separate piece (the upper surface, nearest the strings), was most often made of deal or some other soft wood, and the bridge was usually made of cherry or some other fruitwood. Two soundholes, or circular openings about an inch to an inch and a quarter in diameter, were cut into the soundboard to allow pulsating air from the soundbox to escape and strengthen the tone. The two G strings (to use Jones's terminology - see above) ran parallel to the fingerboard, but not over it, so those strings were used as fixed-pitch drones which could be plucked by the player's left thumb. The remaining strings, which were tightened and loosened with metal harp wrest-pins and a tuning <b>key</b> or <b>wrench,</b> were usually bowed with a horsehair and wood bow. One characteristic feature of the crwth is that one leg of the bridge goes through a soundhole (see picture of player) and rests {{on the back of the}} instrument (the bottom of the soundbox). Although it has been conjectured that this is a primitive attempt at a sound post, or anima, something the instrument lacks, it is equally likely that it is designed to take some of the downward pressure of the tightened strings off the soundboard. Since that piece is flat, unbraced, and usually made of soft wood, it is much weaker than the belly of a violin.|$|R
5000|$|Queen Anne pistols are {{characterized}} {{by the fact that}} the breech and the trigger plate are forged in one piece with the lock plate, foreshadowing by over 100 years the so-called [...] "action" [...] of a modern weapon. A variant, made for muzzle loading with loose shot, had the barrel integral with the breech but in the typical Queen Anne the barrel unscrews with a barrel <b>key</b> or <b>wrench</b> just ahead of the chamber where the powder and ball are placed when the pistol is loaded. The chamber is long and narrow with a cup at the top shaped to fit the bullet (a round lead ball). The user can quickly fill the chamber with black powder and put a bullet on top; the barrel is then replaced, sealing the bullet between its cup and the breech end of the barrel. The bullet is larger than the barrel, so the breech is tapered to compress the ball as it moves forward at the moment of firing to tightly fit the bore. High gas pressure is developed behind the bullet before it is forced into the barrel, thus achieving considerably higher muzzle velocity and power than with a muzzle loader. The barrel was often rifled, which improves accuracy. The system also avoids the need for wadding or a ramrod during loading. It was not successful as a military weapon because in the heat of battle the separate barrel could be dropped during loading. A swiveled, hinged link was designed to allow the barrel to be unscrewed while still remaining attached, but this was evidently not successful. The greatest popularity of the Queen Anne was among civilians as an effective self-defense weapon. It was often highly decorated to suit the tastes of the wealthy.|$|R
