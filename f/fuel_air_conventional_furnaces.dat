40|$|Effects {{of rapid}} heat {{transfer}} using a fluidized bed on the heat-treating response of Al-Si-Mg alloys (both unmodified and Sr modified) were investigated. The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in <b>conventional</b> <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a <b>conventional</b> <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster spherodizing rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains. Whereas the alloy solutionized using a <b>conventional</b> <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> showed two exothermic reactions, one due to annihilation of point defects and the other due to recrystallization, and coarsening of the eutectic grains in the aluminum matrix. The recrystallization temperature of the alloy solutionized in the fluidized bed is lower {{than those in the}} <b>conventional</b> <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace.</b> Both tensile strength and elongation of fluidized bed solutionized alloys are greater than those solutionized using the air convective furnace.

40|$|Nanocrystalline {{zinc ferrite}} (ZFO) has been {{synthesized}} from metal acetylacetonates by microwave irradiation for 5 min {{in the presence}} of a surfactant. The as-prepared material is ZFO and has been subjected in <b>air</b> to <b>conventional</b> <b>furnace</b> annealing and to rapid annealing at different temperatures. Both annealing protocols lead to well-crystallized ZFO, with crystallite sizes in the range similar to 8 - 20 nm, which is ferrimagnetic, even at room temperature, with magnetization attaining saturation. While the magnetization M(S) of conventionally annealed ZFO varies with crystallite size in the expected manner, rapid annealing leads to high M(S) even when the crystallite size is relatively large. The coercivity is greater in the conventionally annealed ZFO. Thermal and magnetic measurements suggest that the inhomogeneous site cationic distribution within each crystallite caused by rapid annealing can be used to tailor the magnetic behaviour of nanocrystalline ferrites...|$|R

40|$|Degradation {{of thermal}} barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) in gas-turbine engines by molten calcium-magnesium-aluminosilicate (CMAS) glassy deposits {{is becoming a}} pressing issue, as engines are required to operate under increasingly harsh conditions. While new approaches for mitigating CMAS attack of TBCs are starting to emerge, {{there is a need}} for appropriate tests for evaluating the efficacy of those approaches. To that end, we present here a new thermal-cycling test for the evaluation of TBC performance, where a thermal gradient is applied across the TBC. with simultaneous injection of CMAS. The conditions simulated in this new test are closer to actual conditions in an engine, as compared to the <b>conventional</b> <b>furnace</b> test without thermal gradient. This new test is applied to a TBC with a new composition designed for mitigating CMAS attack, where the mitigation mechanisms are observed to be similar to those found in the <b>conventional</b> <b>furnace</b> test. However, based on a previously established mechanics model it is shown here that thermal-gradient cyclic testing is essential for evaluating thermomechanical performance of TBCs under attack by CMAS, and that the use of just the <b>conventional</b> <b>furnace</b> test can lead to the underestimation of the TBC performance.

To quantitatively study the mechanism {{of the effect of}} spray position on <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> mixing process, the deviation of spray centroid was introduced to describe the spray position change in combustion chamber. The results show that the gas intake swirl can affect the spatial distribution of spray in combustion chamber under three directions in cylindrical coordinate, in which the circumferential distribution is affected most. It then can be concluded that the spray can be limited to the vicinity of the combustion chamber axis. Better spray position, which is more helpful for the process of <b>fuel</b> <b>air</b> mixing and combustion, can be achieved by using optimal swirl, so that the power performance will be improved...|$|R
