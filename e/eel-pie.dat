The boy waited outside till he was hungry and tired--and then went into the eating-house, in his turn. He had a shilling in his pocket; and he dined sumptuously, he tells me, on a black-pudding, an <b>eel-pie,</b> and a bottle of ginger-beer. What can a boy not digest? The substance in question has never been found yet." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{an example}} must be made. Messengers were sent off {{scouring}} the town for Mr. Corkscrew, and about midnight he was found, still true to the 'Magpie and Stump,' but hardly in condition {{to understand the}} misfortune which had befallen him. So much as this, however, did make itself manifest to him, that he must by no means join his jolly-souled brethren at the <b>Eel-pie</b> Island, and {{that he must be}} at his office punctually at ten o'clock the next morning if he had any intention of saving himself from dismissal. When Charley arrived at his office, Mr. Corkscrew was still with the authorities, and Charley's turn was to come next.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not waste}} {{time on the}} rest of the audience. She went direct for that coalheaver, and thereupon ensued a slanging match the memory of which sends a trill of admiration through me even to this day. It was a battle worthy of the gods. He was a heaver of coals, quick and ready beyond his kind. During many years sojourn East and South, in the course of many wanderings from Billingsgate to Limehouse Hole, from Petticoat Lane to Whitechapel Road; out of <b>eel-pie</b> shop and penny gaff; out of tavern and street, and court and doss-house, he had {{gathered}} together slang words and terms and phrases, and they came back to him now, and he stood up against her manfully.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} story was told. On the {{preceding}} afternoon, Mr. Corkscrew had been subjected to the dire temptation of a boating party to the <b>Eel-pie</b> Island for the following day, and a dinner thereon. There were {{to be at the}} feast no less than four-and-twenty jolly souls, and it was intimated to Mr. Corkscrew that as no soul was esteemed to be more jolly than his own, the party would be considered as very imperfect unless he could join it. Asking for a day's leave Mr. Corkscrew knew {{to be out of the}} question; he had already taken too many without asking. He was therefore driven to take another in the same way, and had to look about for some excuse which might support him in his difficulty. An excuse it must be, not only new, but very valid; one so strong that it could not be overset; one so well avouched that it could not be doubted. Accordingly, after mature consideration, he sat down after leaving his office, and wrote the following letter, before he started on an evening cruising expedition with some others of the party to prepare for the next day's festivities.|$|E
60|$|It {{had come}} to pass, that afternoon, that Miss Morleena Kenwigs had {{received}} an invitation to repair next day, per steamer from Westminster Bridge, unto the <b>Eel-pie</b> Island at Twickenham: there to make merry upon a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub, and shrimps, and to dance {{in the open air}} to the music of a locomotive band, conveyed thither for the purpose: the steamer being specially engaged by a dancing-master of extensive connection for the accommodation of his numerous pupils, and the pupils displaying their appreciation of the dancing-master's services, by purchasing themselves, and inducing their friends to do the like, divers light-blue tickets, entitling them to join the expedition. Of these light-blue tickets, one had been presented by an ambitious neighbour to Miss Morleena Kenwigs, with an invitation to join her daughters; and Mrs Kenwigs, rightly deeming that the honour of the family was involved in Miss Morleena's making the most splendid appearance possible on so short a notice, and testifying to the dancing-master that there were other dancing-masters besides him, and to all fathers and mothers present that other people's children could learn to be genteel besides theirs, had fainted away twice under the magnitude of her preparations, but, upheld by a determination to sustain the family name or perish in the attempt, was still hard at work when Newman Noggs came home.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, {{in this part}} of Hornsey parish, there were no houses between Crouch End and Archway Road to the west and only the huge Harringay House between Crouch End and Green Lanes. To the south, Stapleton Hall stood alone at Stroud Green, near to {{recently}} enclosed common land, and Hornsey Wood House (in what is now the park of Finsbury Park). Several cottages were in Wood Lane, near the present day Seven Sisters Road. A path led south-west to a bridge over the New River. Here, facing Blackstock Road, had stood since before 1804 the old <b>Eel-Pie</b> house, later (by 1847) the Highbury Sluice House tavern, with riverside gardens and the sluice-house itself immediately to the south. Other than those, and houses in 'South Hornsey detached' (now the area of Brownswood Road, south of Finsbury Park), there was nothing else south of the so-called 'Northern Hog's Back', a ridge of land that runs roughly west south-west to east north-east from Highgate to the present-day Harringay (West) station, the highest part of Stroud Green that borders Crouch End.|$|E
