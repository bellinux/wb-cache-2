25|$|In West Germany {{there was}} anger among leftist youth at the post-war denazification in West Germany and East Germany, which was {{perceived}} as a failure or as ineffective, as former (actual and supposed) Nazis held positions in government and the economy. The Communist Party of Germany had been outlawed since 1956. Elected and appointed government positions down to the local level were often occupied by ex-Nazis. Konrad Adenauer, the first Federal Republic chancellor (in office 1949–63), had even appointed former Nazi sympathiser Hans Globke as Director of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Chancellery</b> of West Germany (in office 1953–63).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} and analyze the changes in people's understanding and attitudes towards economic, social and political reforms taking place in Bulgaria since 1989. On the basis of the data of numerous nationally representative studies carried out periodically during the last 10 years, the authors discuss the dynamics of public support of the reforms in national economy, education and health care, and also people's claims towards the state institutions.
