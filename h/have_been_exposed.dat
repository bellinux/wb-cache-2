5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to these agents.|$|E

5|$|Military {{personnel}} {{who were involved}} in storage, mixture and transportation (including aircraft mechanics), and actual use of the chemicals were probably among those who received the heaviest exposures.

5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to food poisoning, {{and those who have}} recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|In these engagements it {{is claimed}} that a whole Ottoman {{battalion}} was captured or killed. Over 100 Ottoman soldiers were killed. Among the 172 prisoners were many wounded, while the British losses were under 60. It {{had been a}} crucial battle; if El Burj had been captured the British would have lost {{the use of the}} road leading up from Berfilya, and the Beit Nuba–Beit Sira valley would have become untenable. The left flank of the infantry's main advance on Jerusalem would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed,</b> which would have also weakened the pressure being exerted towards the Nablus road.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{planned for the}} purpose of {{determining}} the effect of exposure to violence during pregnancy on self-esteem. Material and Methods: A comparative and descriptive study which is conducted on 164 pregnant women with 26 women exposed to violence during pregnancy and 138 women without exposure. Data were collected with the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Chi square, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used in the analysis of the data. Results: Women’s mean age in the study was 26. 35 ± 5. 10. Of the women 16 % reported that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to any type of violence during pregnancy, of these women 69 % <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> violence by their husband. It was determined that there was no statistically significant difference regarding age, occupation and educational level among two groups of women. It was determined that women who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> violence during pregnancy had more incidence of abortions. The mean of self-esteem scale was 36. 91 ± 2. 65 for women who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to violence, 38. 71 ± 3. 59 for women who <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to violence (p= 0. 003). It was determined that there was a significant relationship between “exposing to violence” and “number of abortions”. Conclusion: The women in this study who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to violence during pregnancy had lower self-esteem than those who had not...|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested for the presence of 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to radiation.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the pygmy slow loris is seasonal. In north Vietnam, for example, {{the winter}} is {{characterized}} by low rainfalls and temperatures as low as , when there is little growth of vegetation in forests, few insects, and limited food resources. The pygmy slow loris will also consume insects that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> by its bamboo-gouging activities. It will use its toothcomb to clean an area of lichens and fungi prior to gouging. The animals conserve energy in the colder winter months by reducing movement, often {{to the point of}} complete inactivity.|$|E
5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic Sicily in {{the central}} Mediterranean, off the Italian peninsula, has been colonised by the Greeks, then it was under the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ostrogoths, the Muslims, the Normans, the Hohenstaufen, the Angevins and the Aragonese, after whom it became a {{province}} of the Spanish Empire and then {{was part of the}} Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before finally being absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Thus Sicilians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to a rich sequence of disparate cultures; this is reflected in the extraordinary diversity of architecture on the island.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> {{to higher levels of}} androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
5|$|SV40 {{was found}} to be present in stocks of the {{injected}} form of the polio vaccine (IPV) in use between 1955 and 1963. It is not found in the OPV form. Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; {{it has been estimated that}} 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40. Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated; meaning hundreds of millions more may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to SV40.|$|E

He and his two elder siblings {{were sent to the}} English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling, in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to heparin {{in the last few}} months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given {{a clean bill of}} health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player if they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about {{to run out of}} ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{method of}} {{prevention}} for pertussis is vaccination.

Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> and {{are at high risk}} of severe disease (such as infants).|$|E

40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to teratogenic substances, such as nicotine or alcohol, {{increases the risk}} of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To date, studies examining this relationship have used symptom scales as outcome measures to assess the effect of prenatal exposure, and have not investigated the neurobiological pathways involved. This study explores the effect of prenatal {{exposure to}} cigarettes or alcohol on brain volume in children with ADHD and typically developing controls. Children with ADHD who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> prenatally to either substance were individually matched to children with and without ADHD who <b>had</b> not <b>been.</b> Controls who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> prenatally <b>were</b> also individually matched to controls who <b>had</b> not <b>been.</b> For prenatal exposure to both smoking and alcohol, we found a pattern where subjects with ADHD who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>had</b> the smallest brain volumes and unexposed controls had the largest, with intermediate volumes for unexposed subjects with ADHD. This effect was most pronounced for cerebellum. A similar reduction fell short of significance for controls who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to cigarettes, but not alcohol. Our results are consistent with an additive effect of prenatal exposure and ADHD on brain volume, with the effects most pronounced for cerebellum...|$|R
