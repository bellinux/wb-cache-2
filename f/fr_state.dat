40|$|AbstractIntramolecular proton {{transfer}} of heme-copper oxidases is performed via the K- and the transmembrane D-channels. A carboxyl group conserved in a subgroup of heme-copper oxidases, {{located within the}} D-channel close to the binuclear center (=glutamic acid- 286 in cytochrome bo 3 from Escherichia coli) is essential for proton pumping. Upon electron transfer to the fully oxidized (FO) enzyme, this amino acid {{has been shown to}} undergo a cyanide-independent environmental change. The redox-induced environmental transition of glutamic acid- 286 is preserved in the site-directed mutant Y 288 F, which has lost its CuB binding capacity. Furthermore, the mixed-valence (MV) redox state of cytochrome bo 3 (in which CuB and high-spin heme are reduced, whereas the low-spin heme stays oxidized) was prepared by anaerobic exposure of the protein to carbon monoxide. This complex was converted (i) to the FO state by reaction with the caged dioxygen donor (μ-peroxo) (μ-hydroxo) bis [bis (bipyridyl) cobalt (III) ] and (ii) to the fully reduced (<b>FR)</b> <b>state</b> via caged electron donors; the environmental change of glutamic acid- 286 could be observed only upon reduction. Taken together, these results from two different lines of evidence clearly show that the redox transition of the low-spin heme b center alone triggers the change in the chemical environment of this acidic side chain. It is suggested that glutamic acid- 286 is a kinetic enhancer of proton translocation, which is energetically favoured in mesophilic oxidases...|$|E

40|$|In-depth {{investigation}} of (alpha-gamma) -coincidences at the sup 2 sup 2 sup 5 Ac decay is carried out. Twenty-one new weak gamma-rays are found; 18 gamma-rays earlier {{ascribed to the}} sup 2 sup 2 sup 5 Ac decay are not confirmed. The quantitative analysis of the (alpha-gamma) -coincidences {{makes it possible to}} find the intensity of population of sup 2 sup 2 sup 1 Fr levels by the alpha decay and multipolarities of five weak gamma-transitions. The conversion electron spectrum is investigated in the range of 5 - 24 keV with a high (some 20 eV) energy resolution. A new M 1 type 10. 6 -keV gamma-transition is found. The proposed sup 2 sup 2 sup 5 Ac decay scheme includes 31 excited sup 2 sup 2 sup 1 <b>Fr</b> <b>states.</b> Parities are established for 16 of them. Possible spin values are proposed for sup 2 sup 2 sup 1 Fr levels.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) {{resonance}} on the optical absorption spectra of strongly biased superlattices are theoretically investigated. Exciton Fano resonance (<b>FR)</b> <b>states</b> in this system are calculated based on the multichannel scattering theory. When the bias of a static electric field (F) is applied such that a WSL subband state is energetically aligned with its adjacent ones, resulting in an anticrossing with strong repulsion due to Zener resonance, we obtain the following findings. (i) The onset of exciton absorption noticeably shifts toward the lower energy side, accompanying the oscillation {{of the magnitude of}} the absorption tail with the change in F. However, for the anticrossing, this effect is limited to a small localized region of F. In fact, a slight change in F away from the anticrossing leads to a peculiar suppression of the redshift of the absorption tail edge. (ii) The absorption intensities and the positions of the <b>FR</b> <b>states</b> vary in an irregular manner due to the Zener breakdown as F traverses the anticrossing region. For instances in a certain WSL state, the oscillator strength is reduced by a large extent only in the anticrossing region, followed by recovery of the intensity out of this region. Moreover, the changes in Fano’s q values with respect to F are also discussed. As described in (i) and (ii), these two effects on the exciton spectra are due to the delocalization of WSL wave functions across several periods that accompany the strong anticrossing...|$|R
