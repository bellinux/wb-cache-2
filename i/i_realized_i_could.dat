5000|$|In his {{treatment}} of these festivals Le Clézio maintains his characteristic style: a sense of respect, admiration, and artistic curiosity for the world of others. He plays, in a sense, the perennial role of an outsider looking {{into the world of}} another culture, a man exploring his world through the art of a different humanity. He closes the section on the Embera's ritual singing with the following explanation: [...] "I wanted to describe the singing festival of the Embera Indians because participating in it radically changed my idea of art—the affirmation of another time and another reality that is art. Having once had this experience, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never again witness an art form more complete and more laden with meaning than this one, whose goal was not only to cure but also to restore lost equilibrium.…I had found the most perfect form, the deepest expression that a human being can give to any quest." ...|$|E

In a history class at his college in São Paulo state, his teacher asserted that Brazil's [...] "popular cash transfer program applauded by many experts around the globe {{was responsible for the}} expansion of Brazil's middle class and for lifting millions of citizens from poverty during the last decade." [...] Kataguiri was not convinced: [...] "That just seemed wrong. The family allowance might be necessary, but it has flaws and the main reasons for our high economic growth was the commodities boom and our relationship with China." [...] He was also struck by how his peers readily accepted Brazil's model of state capitalism as practiced by the ruling Workers' Party. Rather than respond to his teacher in class, Kataguiri posted a video to YouTube, which quickly went viral. Kataguiri said, [...] "This was when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use the internet to defend free market values."

During this time, Cindy would begin to explore the ideas which would later become a hallmark of her work, and would dress up as different characters , cobbled together from thrift store clothing. Frustrated with what she saw as the medium's limitations, she abandoned the form and took up photography. [...] "There was nothing more to say painting", she later recalled. [...] "I was meticulously copying other art and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead." [...] Sherman has said about this time: [...] "One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don't want to do this. But if we're {{going to have to}} go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that." [...] She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credits with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms. At college she met Robert Longo, who encouraged her to record her process of [...] "dolling up" [...] for parties. This was the beginning of her Untitled Film Still series.|$|E
40|$|As a new {{semester}} begins, most faculty share {{a common}} goal. We’d like to start the semester off right with classrooms full of students who {{really want to be}} there. It helps if they are engaged and complete the semester. A common frustration for many of us is having a full class that first day—and possibly turning away students interested in adding your class—only to have empty seats later in the term. So how do we keep the students who attend class on day one engaged throughout the semester? One key component is to have a successful beginning in {{each and every one of}} your classes. We’ve all heard stories and maybe even have personal experience with bad beginnings. This past spring, I was at a professional development workshop on my campus about learning communities. The facilitator spent time discussing classroom activities for the first day of class, activities designed to increase the sense of community and to engage your students from day one.

40|$|I {{have always}} loved Italy. My {{heritage}} drew me in, {{but the food}} got me hooked, and the language made me fall in love. The natural next steps were a trip, and more classes, and a semester abroad. My semester in Lazio was everything I could have hoped for, from out-of-theclassroom programs to my incredible host family, and my experiences as a real member of an Italian community were the initial inspirations for this project. From there came the books, what everyone else thought about foreigners in Italy and surviving culture shock and the why of traveling. But for all I love Ernest Hemingway and Alain de Botton, none of these sources really captured the way I felt about Italy, and the small communities of Lazio in particular. I adored every moment of my stay in Italy, enchanted by the culture and the people, but I will admit to sometimes being simply overwhelmed by the Italianness of it all – days when I was exhausted from spending eight hours {{at the kitchen table}} or just wanted the man in the tabacchi shop to understand which stamps I was trying to buy. But I didn’t want to write just another book about culture shock or being a stranger in a strange land, so I drew particularly on my experiences as an agnostic in a Catholic country, the strange things I felt visiting the great cathedrals of Italy. Barely a week into my semester, I had the fortune of witnessing the Macchina di Santa Rosa just down the road, and I latched onto the strangeness and wonder of it. What could it be like, {{to be one of those}} people, so caught up in all the legend and lore of these traditions? <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never know, because I could never be from Viterbo, and that was of crucial importance.

40|$|A bit of {{background}} {{to set the}} stage, if you’ll indulge me. Growing up in West Bloomfield, Michigan, I was never overly ambitious, nor did I have any lofty academic goals. In particular, I never had any desire {{to go to law}} school or, for that matter, to become a lawyer. I come from a family of trial attorneys and it never interested me much. I was a numbers person and didn’t enjoy a lot of deep reading and essay writing (somewhat ironic as I’m writing this for a law journal). But when I started in public accounting and developed a strong interest in tax, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do much more with a law degree than only a CPA. At that point, with good but not great grades from Michigan undergraduate business school and good but not great LSAT scores, as well as a desire {{to go to law school}} in Michigan for cost reasons, I applied to Wayne State University Law School and was accepted. Much to my surprise, I really enjoyed law school and was very happy at Wayne. Also, I ended up with straight As and was tied for first in my class. It seemed like I had found my groove, so at that point, I decided I should apply to transfer to the University of Michigan Law School, and I was thrilled to be accepted. Straight off, I elected any tax and business courses that I could find. Which leads me, finally, to Professor Kahn. My first tax course was personal income tax with Professor Kahn. I was a bit intimidated, and for good reason. He had written numerous books that were essential to the study of tax law and he was somewhat of a legend in the history of the University of Michigan Law School. My best friend’s dad had Professor Kahn twenty plus years before I did, and I had heard a lot about him. As it turned out, Professor Kahn was also brilliant, funny and made what could be a dry topic very engaging. I remember the first time he called on me like it was yesterday. He seemed to like my thought process and my answer. It was a huge relief...|$|E

In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany.

[...] She believes the medium {{is a powerful}} tool when discussing various issues. She says that because she was raised between the Middle East and the Mid-West, she has a unique perspective, one {{that she wanted to}} represent in her films. As a result, her films are somewhat autobiographical, and the influences drawn from her own personal life are quite evident. And so, her films take on themes of immigration, discrimination, cultural assimilation, and family. Her two first feature films compliment one another, and as Cherien puts it, the two [...] "complete a diptych". Amreeka was about being Arab in America, and May in The Summer was about being American in the Middle East. The two films represent the merging, and often clashing, of two separate worlds.|$|R
