25|$|Delhi {{was once}} {{the capital of the}} Mughal empire, and it became the birthplace of Mughlai cuisine. Delhi is noted for its street food. The Paranthewali Gali in Chandani Chowk {{is just one of the}} culinary {{landmarks}} for stuffed flatbread (paranthas). Delhi <b>has</b> <b>people</b> from different parts of India, thus the city has different types of food traditions; its cuisine is influenced by the various cultures. Punjabi cuisine is common, due to the dominance of Punjabi communities. Delhi cuisine is actually an amalgam of different Indian cuisines modified in unique ways. This is apparent in the different types of street food available. Kababs, kachauri, chaat, Indian sweets, Indian ice cream (commonly called kulfi), and even western food items like sandwiches and patties, are prepared in a style unique to Delhi and are quite popular.|$|E

The {{first game}} was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By the 1950s, {{basketball}} had become a major college sport, thus {{paving the way for}} a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game.

The hall of fame <b>has</b> <b>people</b> who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.

500|$|Writer David Wolstencroft {{decided that}} Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, {{according}} to Wolstencroft, [...] "something {{that has an}} enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand," [...] and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, <b>has</b> <b>people</b> reluctant to be asking questions about. A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that [...] "children are the best spies of all"; Maisie is often seen [...] "spying" [...] on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series.|$|E

Asked later by reporters to describe [...] "South Toronto" [...] in greater detail, Congressman Hostettler characterized the area as [...] "a location which I understand is the type of enclave that allows for this radical type of discussion to go on." [...] Hostettler's remarks garnered controversy in Canada as he opposes Canadian requests to delay the impending requirement for the use of passports by both Canadian and American citizens at the Canada-U.S. border.|$|E

2500|$|Raymond E. Brown {{notes the}} {{apparent}} disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting {{the words of}} Jesus concerning his prediction {{of the destruction of}} the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: [...] "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." [...] However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who [...] "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 <b>has</b> <b>people</b> accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking [...] "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was to happen to the Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the Wailing Wall.|$|E

6000|$|MORNING OF AUGUST 12th, Friedrich has, in his bad lodging at Seichau, laid a {{new plan}} of route: [...] "Towards Schweidnitz let it be; round by Pombsen and the southeast, by the Hill-roads, make a sweep flankward of the enemy!"--and <b>has</b> <b>people</b> out reconnoitring the Hill-roads.
