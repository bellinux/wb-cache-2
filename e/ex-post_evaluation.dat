40|$|In recent years, {{recognition}} that bogus self-employment is rapidly growing, {{not least because}} of the advent {{of what has been}} called the ‘gig,’ ‘sharing’ or ‘collaborative’ economy, has led governments to search for ways to tackle this form of dependent self-employment that is widely viewed as diminishing the quality of working conditions. Until now, however, there have been few <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> of policy initiatives that seek to tackle this phenomenon. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} provide one of the first <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> by examining the outcomes of a 2016 legislative initiative in Romania to tackle bogus self-employment. Reporting both descriptive statistics and OLS regression analysis on monthly official data from August 2014 to August 2016, the finding is that while other business types and waged employment rates followed a similar trend to the years before the introduction of the new legislation, the number of self-employed started a negative trend after the new legislation was announced. After controlling for other indicators related to the economy (i. e. GDP) and labor market (i. e. employees, other companies, vacancy rates), the impact of the new legislation on the self-employed remains negative, offering reasonable grounds for assuming bogus self-employed was lowered by the new legislation.

In its first year of operation, WP attracted much public criticism because job placements were below the initial projections made by DWP.

Performance has improved since then, especially for the long-term unemployed and youth 21. However, it is still the case that attempts to activate more of the disabled into work have been particularly difficult and led to much unfavourable comment in the media.

Over the catchment as a whole (including upper reaches, floodplain, coastal lagoons, and new and pre-existing reservoirs), the net effect on the value of aggregate production was estimated to have been positive. Sustaining this benefit was contingent on adoption of improved regimes for the management of reservoir water levels and fish stocks. Improvements in the management of the hydrological regime of coastal lagoons would also further raise aggregate production. Although practiced by a minority of rural households, fishing was found to perform a wide range of livelihood functions, including: livelihood of last resort (landless fishers); part of a diversified subsistence or accumulation strategy; or a specialist occupation. Disaggregated analysis of the impacts on the livelihoods of households who practiced fishing showed different effects, depending on where the household fished, and the functions performed by fishing in their livelihood strategy.|$|E

Together with other donors Germany supports the District Development Facility since 2009, established under the lead of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development.

With a simple representation scheme, and with the aim of opening discussion of the potentials and limits of evaluation for the future, the paper points out the existence of an “implementation paradox”: how, and to what extent, is it possible to reinforce connections between the macro objectives defined at the higher levels and the individual poli-cies/projects downstream in the planning process?Infrastructures, Regional Development Policy, European Union...|$|R

The greatest difference between the ex-ante analyses and <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> made by DARES in the recent period concerns the actual reduction in the working week, which was ultimately smaller than had been calculated in the ex-ante simulation exercises.

40|$|This paper compares two {{different}} ways of doing policy evaluation: on the one hand, quasi-experimental methods (or <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations)</b> which exploit {{the introduction of a}} reform and identify its effect by comparing treated and untreated individuals; on the other hand, structural models (or ex-ante evaluations) which are based on economic theory and predict the effect of potential reforms by using the estimates of behavioural parameters. The comparison is carried out using an empirical case. In 1998, in Norway, a major welfare reform changed the rules of the most generous benefit for lone parents: it increased the amount of the benefit and introduced working requirements. Using a quasi-experimental evaluation approach, it is found a positive effect of the reform on lone mothers' employment.

On the other hand, the authors looked at evaluations of these reforms that had been commissioned by government, in order to sketch out the evaluation criteria and perspectives. Criteria in the preceding debate and in the <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> are compared within each case, as well as between cases. Proceeding along an inductive path, the authors link evaluation practice to theory. Do the criteria identified fit available models of quality in local governance? And, on the other hand, can an existing model grasp all the criteria at stake in such drastic reforms? The three case studies are: the country-wide amalgamation operation of 1976; the introduction of a new and more differentiated framework for inter-municipal cooperation; and the formulation of intra-municipal decentralisation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an ex-post {{assessment}} of two horizontal mergers {{motivated by the}} dearth in post-merger analyses in the South African context. The objective is to examine whether market dynamics have changed as stated by the Competition Tribunal. The main theories tested are whether the merged firm post-merger was able to exert market power unilaterally or in coordinated manner. These constructs are examined against the ability of customers to restrain market power, barriers to entry, {{the effect of the}} remedies imposed and the financial performance. The results reveal that the Tribunal leans towards the SCP doctrine and demonstrates the need for a dynamic approach in competitive assessments informed by understanding how competitors and customers may react to a merger. The research findings indicate that the Tribunal’s conclusions on both the Nampak/Burcap and Scaw/Ozz transactions were unproven, post-merger. The research also demonstrates the need and importance of <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations</b> to improve future decisions on mergers. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

30|$|If {{quantitative}} forecasts are {{not possible}} with sufficient precision, {{what kind of}} analysis can economics contribute to economic policy consulting? In my opinion, there are essentially three feasible forms of deliverable input for policy advice. First—often underestimated—economists can get some mileage by contributing simple and measurable facts to the policy debate. Political exponents, who proclaim the end of jobs every time new technology emerges, can for example easily be confronted with {{the simple fact that}} employment in Switzerland has continually risen in the last century—despite immense technological progress. Secondly, basic economic concepts can be helpful in convincingly explaining the consequences of economic policy measures. Simple supply and demand curve analysis suffices to show that a minimum wage, which is significantly higher than the equilibrium wage will reduce employment. And thirdly, economic history provides a wealth of material through which one can learn from the results of past economic policy measures. The introductory example of the analysis of economic policy and its shortcomings during the Great Depression impressively demonstrates the immediate value of such <b>ex-post</b> <b>evaluations.</b> It is certainly possible, therefore, to expect reliable estimates on the qualitative effects of economic policy measures from economics.|$|R
