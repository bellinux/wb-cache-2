25|$|In 2011 China was {{the largest}} {{producer}} of steel in the world producing 45% of the world's steel, 683milliontons, an increase of 9% from 2010. 6 of 10 of largest steel producers {{in the world are}} in China. Profits are low despite continued high demand due to high debt and overproduction of high end products produced with the equipment financed by the high debt. The central government is aware of this problem but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> way to resolve it as local governments strongly support local steel production. Meanwhile, each firm aggressively increases production. Iron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140milliontons in 2000 increased to 419milliontons in 2006. Much of the country's steel output comes from a large number of small-scale producing centers, one of the largest being Anshan in Liaoning.|$|E

500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E

500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy,</b> non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Sheen starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan in {{the romantic}} drama Far from the Madding Crowd as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood. His performance was well received. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker remarked: [...] "How you prevent such a fellow, crushed {{by his own}} decency, from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> task, yet Sheen succeeds, and Boldwood's brave smile grows dreadful to behold." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the character [...] "pitiful, and sometimes downright painful to watch. He's not Hardy's Boldwood, but he's a Boldwood. The only sad, genuine moment of the film belongs to him." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked that Sheen's face [...] "is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration, forever {{trying to find ways}} to forgive the loved one in advance for rejection. When Sheen's Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels [...] "grief" [...] you really can feel his pain." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief, commenting: [...] "Sheen's performance is fine-grained, and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending." [...] Also in 2015, Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Spoils Before Dying and 7 Days in Hell. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said his television host in 7 Days in Hell was [...] "played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery." [...] Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire said he may have [...] "stolen the show" [...] while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described him as the [...] "scene-stealer of the bunch." ...|$|E
