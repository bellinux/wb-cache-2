40|$|This {{integrative}} review {{aimed to}} identify and assess evidence available {{about the use of}} high-efficiency air filters, protective <b>isolation</b> and <b>masks</b> for infection prevention in patients submitted to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during hospitalization. LILACS, PUBMED, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were used to select the articles. Of the 1023 identified publications, 15 were sampled. The use of HEPA filters is recommended for patients submitted to allogeneic transplantation during the neutropenia period. The level of evidence of protective isolation is weak (VI) and the studies evaluated did not recommend its use. No studies with strong evidence (I and II) were evaluated that justify the use of masks, while Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations should be followed regarding the use of special respirators by immunocompromised patients.

This detached leaf in vitro model was firstly applied to deoxynivalenol with satisfying results. The biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside was confirmed using its respective commercially available reference standard. Secondly, the detached leaf in vitro model was applied to T- 2 toxin. Mono- and tri-glucoside derivatives of T- 2 toxin and HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 -(3) -glucoside, T- 2 -(3) -triglucoside and HT- 2 -(3) -glucoside were identified and characterised using Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry.

40|$|International audienceRecognition {{performance}} for a target letter {{embedded in a}} string of characters is worse than that for targets presented in <b>isolation.</b> This lateral <b>masking</b> (LM) effect is known to depend on target eccentricity and spacing between target and flankers (Bouma, 1970), indicating that LM arises in early visual processing due to interactions among visual features. The feature interaction account would predict that flankers consisting of similar features produce similar LM effects and that differences in LM produced by different types of flanker diminish with increasing target eccentricity and decreasing spacing. However, in a series of six experiments, this prediction was shown not to be true. Flankers that did not access a higher level code (e. g., pseudoletters or rotated letters) produced more LM than standard letter flankers. Moreover, effects of different flanker types were most pronounced for medium target eccentricities and medium spacings for which recognition performance scores ranged between 40 % and 60 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{gratings}} {{beyond the}} Nyquist {{limit of the}} peripheral retina are visible as aliased percepts when presented in isolation, the reported lack of aliasing for targets with complex spectra (edges, lines, letters) suggests that aliased frequency components are invisible {{in the presence of}} sub-Nyquist image components. We tested this hypothesis by systematically exploring a range of stimulus parameters in search of conditions which would enable subjects to detect the supra-Nyquist components of a compound grating. A three-alternative forced-choice masking paradigm was used, which required subjects to discriminate a 2. 5 deg patch of compound grating (mask+test) from a simple grating (mask only). Using a 2 c/deg grating as the masking component, which is well below the 4 c/deg Nyquist limit to veridical perception at 20 deg in the horizontal nasal field, we varied the spatial frequency of the test grating over a range extending above and below the Nyquist frequency. We found that aliased, supra-Nyquist components are reliably detected in the presence of high contrast, sub-Nyquist gratings, provided they have sufficient contrast. Contrast threshold for detecting the aliased gratings was higher when presented as a component of the compound grating than when presented in <b>isolation.</b> This <b>masking</b> effect of the sub-Nyquist component was not specific to supra-Nyquist test targets, however, since a similar masking effect also occurred for sub-Nyquist targets. These results suggest that the invisibility of aliasing described previously for edges or square wave gratings is due primarily to the combination of the low amplitudes of supra-Nyquist harmonics in such stimuli and a high contrast threshold of the peripheral retina. The additional masking effects of the sub-Nyquist, fundamental component of a square wave on the supra-Nyquist harmonics make the detection of aliasing impossible even for very high contrast square wave gratings presented in the periphery.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCommunity {{acquired}} viruses (CRVs) {{may cause}} severe disease in cancer patients. Thus, {{efforts should be}} made to diagnose CRV rapidly and manage CRV infections accordingly. MethodsA panel of 18 clinicians from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology have convened to assess the available literature and provide recommendations on the management of CRV infections including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. ResultsCRV infections in cancer patients may lead to pneumonia in approximately 30 % of the cases, with an associated mortality of around 25 %. For diagnosis of a CRV infection, combined nasal/throat swabs or washes/aspirates give the best results and nucleic acid amplification based-techniques (NAT) should be used to detect the pathogen. Hand hygiene, contact <b>isolation</b> and face <b>masks</b> {{have been shown to be}} of benefit as general infection management. Causal treatment can be given for influenza, using a neuraminidase inhibitor, and respiratory syncytial virus, using ribavirin in addition to intravenous immunoglobulins. Ribavirin has also been used to treat parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus, but data are inconclusive in this setting. Cidofovir is used to treat adenovirus pneumonitis. ConclusionsCRV infections may pose a vital threat to patients with underlying malignancy. This guideline provides information on diagnosis and treatment to improve the outcome...|$|R

40|$|Background. Although {{strategies}} to contain influenza pandemics are well studied, the characterization {{and the implications}} of different geographical and temporal diffusion patterns of the pandemic have been given less attention. Methodology/ Main Findings. Using a well-documented metapopulation model incorporating air travel between 52 major world cities, we identified potential influenza pandemic diffusion profiles and examined how the impact of interventions might be affected by this heterogeneity. Clustering methods applied to a set of pandemic simulations, characterized by seven parameters related to the conditions of emergence that were varied following Latin hypercube sampling, were used to identify six pandemic profiles exhibiting different characteristics notably in terms of global burden (from 415 to. 160 million of cases) and duration (from 26 to 360 days). A multivariate sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate and proportion of susceptibles have a strong impact on the pandemic diffusion. The correlation between interventions and pandemic outcomes were analyzed for two specific profiles: a fast, massive pandemic and a slow building, long-lasting one. In both cases, the date of introduction for five control measures (<b>masks,</b> <b>isolation,</b> prophylactic or therapeutic use of antivirals, vaccination) correlated strongly with pandemic outcomes.

40|$|Performance {{scaling of}} CMOS {{technologies}} beyond the 22 nm node {{will depend on}} the successful introduction of high mobility materials such as germanium and compound semiconductors on silicon substrates, which is not straightforward due to important materials incompatibilities. These semiconductors moreover necessitate new gate dielectric materials as the well-proven recipes of “hafnium-based oxides” are not working for various reasons. The lack of a stable, high-quality native oxide for both semiconductors forces materials scientists and device engineers to focus more on the interface rather than on the dielectric material it self. A first part of this paper discusses problems related to the hetero-epitaxial growth of Ge and of III/V materials on Si. By applying a low-high temperature regime, smooth layers of Ge on Si can be obtained. Because of the lattice mismatch, these layers will relax by the formation of misfit dislocations at the interface, combined with threading arms that extend to the surface. The thickness of the layer determines the final density of threading defects, even in case of confined selective growth in windows in a dielectric hard mask, unless specific measures are taken. The polar nature of III/V’s brings about additional problems of anti-phase domain nucleation. This can be solved by providing extra steps on the starting surface in combination with a “pre-deposition” of arsenic. The combination of Ge and III/V selective epitaxy on patterned wafers allows growing confined layers with a low defect density and of high quality. Moreover, by using standard shallow trench <b>isolation</b> as <b>mask,</b> a very natural integration of these materials in standard Si manufacturing can be realized. The second part of this paper deals with the growth of dielectric materials and control of the resulting interfaces. In contrast to the case of Si, both Ge and III/V surfaces are heavily prone to problems with pinning of the surface Fermi level (FLP), which prohibits an efficient control of the channel by varying gate voltages. In the case of Ge, the problem can be solved by decoupling the gate dielectric from the Ge surface by means of an ultra-thin, strained Si epi-layer, after which the well-known gate stack approaches with ALD-grown metal oxides from the Si world can be used. An alternative, promising solution is passivation with thermally grown GeO 2 followed by ALD high-k, although this process requires much more care than its Si counterpart. Gate dielectrics on III/V, finally, are probably an even bigger challenge. Apart from the Ga 2 O+GaGdOx passivation on GaAs, no real solutions of the FLP problem are known. We will discuss the use of sulfur (from thermal treatments with H 2 S or in the liquid phase with (NH 4) 2 S) in combination with ALD or MBD-grown high-k layers on both GaAs and InGaAs. This will be compared to alternative approaches based on an epitaxially grown interfacial passivation layer of Ge in combination with MBD-grown Al 2 O 3...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{on-going}} programme {{to upgrade}} the SRS control system, a new VME-based system has been developed for the recently installed beamline 5 D. The new system supports intelligent instruments using a VME-based front end computer, Ethernet network and a PC-based user interface. This paper describes the architecture and shows {{how it can be}} easily configured for other applications. 1 BEAMLINE 5 D Beamline 5 D is an advanced vacuum ultraviolet beamline line on the SRS which will be utilised to perform experiments in surface science; investigating the properties of novel magnetic materials and gas phase studies; studying the action of VUV light on gases. 2 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Traditionally, control of the vacuum pumps and instrumentation, together with vacuum <b>isolation</b> valves, radiation <b>masks</b> and station shutters has been integrated into the main SRS accelerator control system. This utilises a Daresbury designed status control and interlock system [1] to provide low-level plant protection and to provide a standard interface to the higher levels of the control system. This system was originally designed to interface to simple, non-intelligent devices requiring nothing more than ON/OFF/RESET control operations. Plant protection was provided by allocating up to 16 hardware interlocks to each device. Additionally, monitoring and control of analogue signals was possible using CAMAC hosted ADCs and DACs. The user interface is a simple text-based program hosted on a 32 -bit mini-computer and uses obsolete Tandy Model 100 portable computers located close to the beamlines as display terminals. This system is not well suited to the control of modern, intelligent instruments and provides only a very rudimentary display of plant status to the user. At the outset of the beamline 5 D project, it was decided that a new, more versatile control system would be required that could offer easy connection {{to a wide variety of}} instrumentation as well as being compatible with the latest developments in the main SRS accelerator control system [2, 3]. 3 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS The main considerations taken into account when designing the new system included: • Compact- ideally, both the control system and the instrumentation should be housed in the same rack...|$|R
