5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E

Both {{in terms of}} the reasons given for making <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes and the frequency of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes, the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policies of Martin and Greenspan were very similar, as were those of Burns and Volcker. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policy of Chairman Miller differed from either of these groups. Measured by the money market's response to <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes, the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policy of Burns and Volcker was the most effective and Miller's the least effective. Evidence is presented that suggests that the differential response {{is due to the fact}} that the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> policy of Burns and Volcker provided the market with more complete information than that of Martin and Greenspan.

(2008) (referred to by World Bank, 2010:8) {{examined}} {{the sensitivity of}} the optimal climate target to assumptions about the time horizon, climate sensitivity, mitigation costs, likely damages, and <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The optimal target was defined as the concentration that would result in the lowest reduction in the present value (i.e., discounted) of global consumption. A set of assumptions that included a relatively high climate sensitivity (i.e., a relatively large global temperature increase for a given increase in GHGs), high damages, a long time horizon, low <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> (i.e., future consumption is valued relatively highly), and low mitigation costs, produced an optimum peak in the concentration of CO2e at 540 parts per million (ppm). Another set of assumptions that assumed a lower climate sensitivity (lower global temperature increase), lower damages, a shorter time horizon, and a higher discount rate (present consumption is valued relatively more highly), produced an optimum peaking at 750ppm.|$|E

5000|$|Stern's {{approach}} to discounting has been debated amongst economists. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> allows economic effects occurring {{at different times}} to be compared. Stern used a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in his calculation {{of the effects of}} [...] "business-as-usual" [...] climate change damages. A high <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> reduces the calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using too low a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> wastes resources because it will result in too much investment in cutting emissions (Arrow et al., 1996, p. 130). Too high a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> will have the opposite effect, and lead to under-investment in cutting emissions. Most studies on the damages of climate change use a higher <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> than that used in the Stern Review. Some economists support Stern's choice of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> (Cline, 2008; Shah, 2008 Heal, 2008) while others are critical (Yohe and Tol, 2008; Nordhaus, 2007).|$|R

" Contrary to common belief the evidence suggests that the does not depend critically on whether the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> change is unanticipated, because all <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes appear to be largely unanticipated. Additional evidence suggests that, despite the fact that there have been instances when <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> was used to signal a change in policy, e. g., the one percentage point increase in the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in October 1979, generally speaking, <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes do not appear to have "signaled" a change in monetary policy. This suggests that the common assertion that market interpret <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes as a signal of a change in Fed policy is incorrect.

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the appropriate measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
25|$|Duration is {{a linear}} {{measure of how}} {{the price of a}} bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond's price with respect to <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond with a duration of 7 would fall about 7% if the market interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.|$|E

These disadvantages were further exacerbated {{by the fact that}} American producers and networks offered Australian channels significant <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> on bundled programming. Taken as a whole, these factors meant that local producers were faced with a relative production-cost ratio on the order of 10:1 or more in favour of the imported product.|$|E
500|$|The Federal Reserve began operations... as a {{peculiar}} hybrid, a partly public, partly private institution, {{intended to be}} independent of political influence with principal officers of the government on its supervisory board, endowed with central banking functions, but not a central bank. [...] Each of the twelve semiautonomous reserve banks set its own <b>discount</b> <b>rates,</b> subject to {{the approval of the}} Federal Reserve Board in Washington, made its own policy decisions, and set its own standards for what was eligible for discounting.Reflecting this intellectual heritage, Meltzer emphasizes (in common with Friedman and Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States) the influence on the founders of the Fed of: (i) the assumption, which was to prove unfounded, that the gold standard would continue to prevail, and (ii) the then widely held (and now discredited) real bills doctrine, which advocated restricting central bank credit to the discounting of commercial paper. [...] In Chapter 3, Meltzer covers the establishment of the Fed and its first decade of operations, a period when, as he shows, key issues such as the respective roles and powers of the Board and the (regional) Federal Reserve Banks were far from settled. [...] These were among the questions eventually addressed in the Banking Act of 1935, which made major changes to the 1913 framework, mainly in the direction of centralizing authority in the Board {{at the expense of the}} regional Federal Reserve Banks.
