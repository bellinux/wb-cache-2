Unlike X.25, whose designers expected analog signals with a relatively high chance of transmission errors, Frame Relay is a fast packet switching technology operating over links with a low chance of transmission errors (usually practically lossless like PDH), {{which means that the}} protocol does not attempt to correct errors. When a Frame Relay network detects an error in a frame, it simply drops that frame. The end points have the responsibility for detecting and retransmitting dropped frames.

5000|$|In 1985, Voice Response Inc. (formerly Call-It Co) a {{subsidiary}} of Lee Enterprises, Davenport IA, entered the fast-growing Interactive Voice (IVR) response market {{under the direction of}} Bob Ross, President. [...] About a year later, VRI introduced one of the first [...] "successful" [...] IVR applications that utilized voice recognition (rather than touch tone) to capture caller responses. Voice recognition technology had great difficulty with regional and ethnic differences and nuances which resulted in a high <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> VRI discovered that hesitation (delayed response) signaled caller confusion or misunderstanding which often resulted in an inaccurate response. VRI developed proprietary techniques that measured user response times and used the data to make real-time changes to the application's dialog with the caller. VRI found that the confidence level of a [...] "suspect" [...] caller response could be increased by asking [...] "Did you say (Chicago), Yes or No", a standard question heard in order taking or reservation making IVR applications today. VRI pioneering applications, including subscription fulfillment for Time -Life Magazine, proved faster and less expensive than call centers using live operators and although VRI did not survive, their voice recognition processes became industry standards and VRI's patent USPTO - patent RE34,587 was eventually licensed by Intel/Dialogic and Nuance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> anonymously reported by general practitioners in NSW. DESIGN: The Threats to Australian Patient Safety (TAPS) study used anonymous reporting <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> by GPs via a secure web-based questionnaire for 12 months from October 2003. SETTING: General practices in NSW from three groupings: major urban centres (RRMA 1), large regional areas (RRMA 2 - 3), and rural and remote areas (RRMA 4 - 7). PARTICIPANTS: 84 GPs from a {{stratified random sample}} {{of the population of}} 4666 NSW GPs - 41 (49 %) from RRMA 1, 22 (26 %) from RRMA 2 - 3, and 21 (25 %) from RRMA 4 - 7. Participants were representative of the GP source population of 4666 doctors in NSW (Medicare items billed, participant age and sex). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number <b>of</b> <b>error</b> reports and <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> reported <b>errors</b> per Medicare patient encounter item and per patient seen per year. RESULTS: 84 GPs submitted 418 error reports, claimed 490 864 Medicare patient encounter items, and saw 166 569 individual patients over 12 months. The <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> reported <b>error</b> per Medicare patient encounter item per year was 0. 078 % (95 % CI, 0. 076 %- 0. 080 %). The <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> reported <b>errors</b> per patient seen per year was 0. 240 % (95 % CI, 0. 235 %- 0. 245 %). No significant difference was seen in error reporting frequency between RRMA groupings. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> GP-reported <b>errors</b> in a representative sample.

This paper employs bootstrapping and Gibbs Sampling techniques to systematically estimate measurement <b>error</b> variance <b>of</b> selected error-prone predictor variables and adjusts for measurement errors in 2 and 4 level model frameworks. Five illustrative data sets, partly supplemented through simulation, were drawn from an educational environment giving rise to the multilevel structures needed.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of synaptic inputs on the dendritic tree of a neuron can have significant influence on neuronal function. Consequently, accurate anatomical reconstructions of neuron morphology and synaptic localization are critical when modeling and predicting physiological responses of individual neurons. Historically, generation of three-dimensional (3 D) neuronal reconstructions together with comprehensive mapping of synaptic inputs has been an extensive task requiring manual identification of putative synaptic contacts directly from tissue samples or digital images. Recent developments in neuronal tracing software applications have improved the speed and accuracy of 3 D reconstructions, but localization of synaptic sites {{through the use of}} pre- and/or post-synaptic markers has remained largely a manual process. To address this problem, we have developed an algorithm, based on 3 D distance measurements between putative pre-synaptic terminals and the post-synaptic dendrite, to automate synaptic contact detection on dendrites of individually labeled neurons from 3 D immunofluorescence image sets. In this study, the algorithm is implemented with custom routines in Matlab, and its effectiveness is evaluated through analysis of primary sensory afferent terminals on motor neurons. Optimization of algorithm parameters enabled automated identification of synaptic contacts that matched those identified by manual inspection with low <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Substantial time savings and the elimination of variability in contact detection introduced by different users are significant advantages of this method.

40|$|BACKGROUND—In {{the past}} 10 years, {{medication}} errors {{have come to}} be recognised as an important cause of iatrogenic disease in hospital patients.  AIMS—To determine the incidence and type of medication errors in a large UK paediatric hospital over a five year period, and to ascertain whether any error prevention programmes had influenced error occurrence.  METHODS—Retrospective review of medication errors documented in standard reporting forms completed prospectively from April 1994 to August 1999. Main outcome measure was <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> reporting, including pre- and post-interventions.  RESULTS—Medication errors occurred in 0. 15 % of admissions (195 errors; one per 662 admissions). While the highest rate occurred in neonatal intensive care (0. 98 %), most errors occurred in medical wards. Nurses were responsible for most reported errors (59 %). Errors involving the intravenous route were commonest (56 %), with antibiotics being the most frequent drug involved (44 %). Fifteen (8 %) involved a tenfold medication error. Although 18 (9. 2 %) required active patient intervention, 96 % of errors were classified as minor at the time of reporting. Forty eight per cent of parents were not told an error had occurred. The introduction of a policy of double checking all drugs dispensed by pharmacy staff led to a reduction in errors from 9. 8 to 6 per year. Changing the error reporting form to make it less punitive increased the error reporting rate from 32. 7 to 38 per year.  CONCLUSION—The overall medication error rate was low. Despite this there are clear opportunities to make system changes to reduce error rates further. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{based on}} naturalistic data are a core {{tool in the}} field of {{language}} acquisition research and have provided thorough descriptions of children's speech. However, these descriptions are inevitably confounded by differences in the relative frequency with which children use words and language structures. The purpose of the present work was to investigate the impact of sampling constraints on estimates of the productivity of children's utterances, and on the validity of error rates. Comparisons were made between five different sized samples of wh-question data produced by one child aged 2; 8. First, we assessed whether sampling constraints undermined the claim (e. g. Tomasello, 2000) that the restricted nature of early child speech reflects a lack of adultlike grammatical knowledge. We demonstrated that small samples were equally likely to under- as overestimate lexical specificity in children's speech, and that the reliability of estimates varies according to sample size. We argued that reliable analyses require a comparison with a control sample, such as that from an adult speaker. Second, we investigated the validity of estimates of error rates based on small samples. The results showed that overall error rates underestimate the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in some rarely produced parts of the system and that analyses on small samples were likely to substantially over- or underestimate error rates in infrequently produced constructions.
