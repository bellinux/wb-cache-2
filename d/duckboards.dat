5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with <b>duckboards</b> to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the <b>duckboards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the <b>duckboards</b> could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
25|$|The Pennine Way {{has long}} been popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission {{reported}} that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using {{all or part of}} the trail per year and that walkers contributed £2million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the route onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or <b>duckboards</b> in softer areas. These actions have been generally effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.|$|E
50|$|The {{track is}} mostly well defined and {{adequately}} marked. The track condition however varies greatly. There are long sections of <b>duckboard</b> (boardwalk) which consist of split logs {{embedded in the}} ground, held together with wire and nails. Where there is no <b>duckboard,</b> the conditions can sometimes be very muddy. In winter, the mud is frozen solid early in the morning, however offsetting {{this is the problem}} of slippery ice on the <b>duckboard.</b> The mud is not nearly as frequent or deep as hikes in the south west, due mainly to the <b>duckboard.</b>|$|R

The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized. U.S. Secretary of War Newton Baker sent novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. Butler began by solving the problem of mud: [...] "he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [...] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the <b>duckboards</b> no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on." [...] General John J. Pershing authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This earned Butler another nickname, [...] "Old Duckboard."

In the area of the German 17th Reserve Division, long trenches were dug to divert water from the front trenches; in January 1916, about [...] of <b>duckboards</b> were laid by Reserve Infantry Regiment 76 alone. Conditions were so bad in the front line that soldiers fraternised to alleviate the conditions and on 25 January the German companies in the front line were transferred to prevent it.

Because of map discrepancies over the front line and the artillery barrage line, it was arranged that both battalions would fall back for [...] before the attack, a difficult manoeuvre on ground with no landmarks, at night and under bombardment.

2500|$|The British {{operations}} {{at the end of}} the Battle of the Ancre in November 1916 had captured German positions on Beaumont Hamel spur and the village of Beaucourt, before the weather stopped operations.

The 11th Division operation failed, when an unknown German dugout was overrun in the fog. German troops emerged and attacked the British troops from behind, at the same time that German counter-attacks from further east began, which pushed the British back to their start line.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the south}} side of the Ancre valley near Courcelette, the 51st Division took over from the 4th Canadian Division on 27 November. The {{division}} had only just been relieved from the line on the north bank, after the Battle of the Ancre [...] with very little time for rest. Constant rain wet the ground so badly, that horses drowned and men became stuck up to their waists; in December ropes were issued to drag soldiers out of the mud. New trenches collapsed as they were dug and the front and support lines were held by shell-hole posts, which became islands of squalor. <b>Duckboards</b> and ration boxes used as platforms sank under the mud; cooking became impossible and movement in daylight suicidal. There were epidemics of dysentery, trench foot and frostbite; old wounds opened. Morale plummeted and moving about after dark led to working parties, runners, reliefs and ration parties getting lost and wandering around until exhausted. No man's land was not wired on this part of the front and British and German troops blundered into the wrong positions, Germans being taken prisoner on six occasions. Some dug-outs in Regina Trench were usable but conditions in the artillery lines were as bad as the front line, with ammunition being delivered by pack horse under German artillery fire. [...] "Elephant" [...] shelters (the materials for which took ten men to carry forward and [...] to build) were placed in the front-line, sunk below trench and shell-hole parapets. Larger shelters were dug into the sides of roads further back and only a minimal number of troops kept in the front zone.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Division, also {{transferred}} from {{the north side of}} the Ancre valley, took over from the 51st Division on 13 January, on a front of , [...] south of the village of Pys. The front line consisted of [...] posts and support positions held by ten platoons, with no positions behind until Courcelette, where three platoons were based, with two companies in the vicinity. Ironside Avenue, a communication trench ran forward [...] towards the front line but was full of mud and impassable. Brushwood tracks which were unusable during the day, continued the route towards the front line. Two battalions took over the front posts, with two more back towards Ovillers and La Boisselle, with the 15th Division on the right and the 18th Division on the left. The 2nd Division continued the consolidation begun earlier by the 51st Division and large working parties laboured non-stop to dig out, clean and pump trenches, fit <b>duckboards</b> and provide overhead cover for the infantry posts in the front line; tramways were built by engineers further back. Both sides were quiet during the rest of January, until the Germans attempted a raid which was stopped by machine-gun fire, before the raiders had passed through the German barbed wire. On {{the north side of the}} valley other British troops captured the rest of the Beaumont Hamel spur. Conditions had been improved by the end of the month, although snowstorms covered such landmarks as existed and relieving parties frequently got lost There was little artillery fire in the divisional areas but much German aircraft activity; British reconnaissance aircraft managed to photograph the front line on 29 January, giving the divisional commander the first accurate information about the position of the front line. The freeze lasted for about five weeks until mid-February, which made movement of carrying-parties much easier as preparations for the next offensive were being made.|$|E

On a little hummock sits a soldier in deep despair, elbows on knees, {{his face in his}} hands. The figure is in entirely correct historical uniform and forms part of a very convincing diorama.

There was only one decent road for the 32nd Division and a <b>duckboard</b> track for the 25th Brigade, 8th Division, to reach their assembly positions.
