Dyer paid the rent to the unwitting landlady, {{and gave her a}} pair of child's boots as a present for <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> The following day, Wednesday 1 April 1896, another child, named Harry Simmons, was taken to Mayo Road. However, with no spare white edging tape available, the length around Doris' corpse was removed and used to strangle the 13-month-old boy.|$|E
25|$|Ormes {{contracted}} with the Terri Lee doll company in 1947 {{to produce a}} play doll based on <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> cartoon character. The Patty-Jo doll was on the shelves in time for Christmas {{and was the first}} American black doll to have an extensive upscale wardrobe. As in the cartoon, the doll represented a real child, in contrast to the majority of dolls that were mammy and Topsy-type dolls. The dolls were popular with both black and white children. In December 1949, Ormes's contract with the Terri Lee company was not renewed, and production ended. Patty-Jo dolls are now highly sought collectors' items.|$|E

Sultan Mecid's other wives attended as well, scattering coins, Until evening {{they passed the}} time listening to the ensemble playing traditional Ottoman music, after which sherbet was served, followed by a banquet. It was quiet a splendid wedding celebration in the palace. That evening according to custom, the couple entered the bridal chamber, where princess Esma kissed the bride and the groom on their foreheads and said a prayer on their behalf, then returned to her villa, giving praise to God that she had lived to see such a magnificent wedding feast for <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E

500|$|Brett Love of TV Squad, on {{the other}} hand, [...] " [...] short of calling [...] an {{excellent}} finale". While the deal's payoff was [...] "fantastic"—he was surprised by Dean's death, and looked forward to its implications for the fourth season—Love was slightly disappointed with Lilith. McCormick [...] "impressed" [...] him as Lilith, {{but he did not}} find her as [...] "menacing and scary" [...] as Fredric Lehne's Azazel. The villain's storyline of terrorizing a family would have made a [...] "great regular episode", but was not epic enough for a finale. Diana Steenbergen of IGN felt the scenes of Lilith's shore leave briefly [...] " [...] the episode down" [...] because the viewers [...] "understood the situation quickly enough". She otherwise liked the episode, and gave it a score of 8.9 out of 10. Steenbergen enjoyed the [...] "first-rate brotherly scenes", and was happy that the series followed through with its promise of sending Dean to Hell, commenting that the related hellhound attack was [...] "one of the scariest things the show has done yet". Like Charles, she applauded the acting, noting that [...] "we feel [...] fear as the deadline approaches". She went on to write that Padalecki's [...] "best moments are in the barely contained rage at his inability to save his brother, and in his grief at losing Dean", while [...] "Lilith and <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> mannerisms in Ruby's body were far more chilling, and interesting, than Ruby's tough chick persona ever has been".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. <b>Her</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{redeemed}} {{creature was}} loud in her gratitude, {{and proceeded to}} obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred by apprehension; the courtiers {{at the same time}} manifesting decided discomfort and uneasiness.
