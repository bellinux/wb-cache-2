500|$|Several of Austen's {{works have}} been subject to {{academic}} study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The <b>first</b> <b>examination</b> <b>came</b> from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into [...] "early" [...] and [...] "late" [...] works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was Jane Austen by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres, which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.|$|E

40|$|Persons {{symptomatic}} and at {{risk for}} Huntington's disease (HD) from a large extended family {{in the state of}} Zulia, Venezuela, have been followed prospectively for 7 years. Between 1981 and 1988, 593 people were examined, of whom 128 had symptomatic HD and 171 persons at risk had examination abnormalities that were insufficient to meet criteria for diagnosis. The remaining 294 had normal examinations. Abnormalities of saccadic eye movement and slowness of rapid alternating movements were the most common abnormalities found in at-risk individuals. Thirty persons who did not meet criteria for diagnosis at their <b>first</b> <b>examination</b> have subsequently been diagnosed with symptomatic HD. Their average age at diagnosis was 33. 5 ± 8. 3 (SD) years. The likelihood of developing symptomatic HD within 3 years was 3 % for those persons with normal <b>first</b> <b>examinations,</b> 23 % for those with mildly abnormal <b>first</b> <b>examinations,</b> and 60 % for those with highly abnormal <b>first</b> <b>examinations.</b> The rate of disease progression in early symptomatic cases were 1. 4 ± 0. 1 (SEM) points per year on the Shoulson-Fahn functional capacity scale. Paternal or maternal inheritance did not appear to affect the rate of progression in this group of individuals. The data suggest {{that there is not a}} discrete age of onset but rather a prolonged period of time during which symptoms unfold...|$|R
60|$|Love has {{an awkward}} way of intruding itself at {{inconvenient}} times, {{but it never}} came more inopportunely than when it smote one who was reading for his <b>first</b> professional <b>examination.</b> During these weeks, when Tom was stumping about in boots which were two sizes too small for him, {{in the hope of}} making his muscular, well-formed foot a trifle more elegant, and was splitting gloves in a way which surprised his glover, all his energies ought by rights to have been concentrated upon the mysteries of botany, chemistry, and zoology. During the precious hours that should have been devoted to the mastering of the sub-divisions of the celenterata or the natural orders of endogenous plants, he was expending his energies in endeavouring to recall the words of the song which his cousin had sung the evening before, or to recollect the exact intonation with which she remarked to him that it had been a fine day, or some other equally momentous observation. It follows that, as the day of the <b>examination</b> <b>came</b> round, the student, in his lucid intervals, began to feel anxious for the result. He had known his work fairly well, however, at one time, and with luck he might pull through. He made an energetic attempt to compress a month's reading into a week, and when the day for the written <b>examination</b> <b>came</b> round he had recovered some of his lost ground. The papers suited him fairly well, and he felt as he left the hall that he had had better fortune than he deserved. The viva voce ordeal was the one, however, which he knew would be most dangerous to him, and he dreaded it accordingly.|$|R
