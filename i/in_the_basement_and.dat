5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business. Revenues from the rental spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> upper floors had also begun to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205. His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera {{from the viewpoint of}} a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

50|$|This was {{to change}} when between 2002 and 2003, when the mall once again when under a revamp {{with a new}} tenant mix. The mall had renovations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements,</b> <b>and</b> a direct link to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station was constructed. Travelators were also {{installed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building {{for the convenience of}} shoppers serving between Basement 2, <b>Basement</b> 1 <b>and</b> Level 1.|$|R

5|$|The house {{contains}} several {{paintings of}} note, including William Powell Frith's Mary, Queen of Scots Bidding Farewell to France (1561) and Godfrey Kneller's {{portrait of the}} Bishop of Salisbury, William Talbot, dated to 1718. Two showrooms at the house {{are open to the}} public. Aside from the tearoom, the exhibition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground floor contains numerous displays related to the Rhys family, the history of the estate and World War II, and is designed as if the year is 1912.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> in the corridor of the house.

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E

50|$|As well as {{numerous}} shops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> ground <b>and</b> first floor, {{there was a}} rooftop restaurant. This was not a successful venture and soon closed.|$|R
50|$|Casa Cavassa was the {{residence}} of Galeazzo Cavassa and his son Francesco, members of a family (ennobled in 1460) native of Carmagnola and both general vicars of the marquisate of Saluzzo. Traces of a building {{dating back to the}} Middle Ages can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ogival windows of the façade overlooking Via San Giovanni. Since 1505 it became ownership of Francesco, vicar first during the rule of Ludovico II of Saluzzo (died 1504) and then during the Marguerite of Foix’s regency.|$|R
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most {{of the victims were}} killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|The house, {{along with}} Dinefwr Castle, {{have since been}} {{restored}} by the National Trust and Cadw respectively. It is a three-storey castellated structure, built from grey stone, with four tall towers in each corner, with sloping slate roofs. The front features a grand central porch. Two rooms {{are open to the}} public, including a tearoom and exhibition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground floor which contain numerous displays related to the history of the estate and occupants. The deer park which surrounds the property was landscaped by Capability Brown in 1775. The surrounding woodland consists mainly of oak and wych elm. Newton House is cited {{as one of the most}} haunted houses in Wales, noted in particular for its ghost of Walter the Butler, a former employee whose tobacco smoke purportedly wafts through the air.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> nine sash windows {{on each of the}} ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the launch}} night, housemates were divided <b>in</b> two houses: <b>the</b> <b>Basement</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mansion.|$|R
50|$|Preceding {{the house}} was a {{fortified}} dwelling. Little trace of this now remains, but a vault from it is believed to still exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of, <b>and</b> otherwise under, the current Castlemartin House.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of Metcalf <b>and</b> Dabney Hall are laundry {{facilities}} for the residents. There {{is a key}} room located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of <b>the</b> Echols dorm. The Housing office for the University of Virginia is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of Page <b>and</b> Emmet dorms. Emmet's basement also includes a mailroom. There is a snack bar, known as [...] "The Castle," [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of Bonnycastle dorms.|$|R
25|$|The Dylan doorway led to {{the first}} {{recordings}} of the New Lost City Ramblers, the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, Canned Heat, The Lovin' Spoonful, Dylan and The Band <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> the Grateful Dead.|$|E
25|$|Heating of {{the halls}} and {{classrooms}} was by coke stoves. In the 1880s Ripley's estates department converted the north hall {{for use as}} offices. A central heating boiler was installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> the coke stoves were replaced by radiators. Some features of the building prefigured, on a smaller scale, Andrews and Pepper's design for the grammar school in Manor Row (1872).|$|E
25|$|Measurements {{within the}} reactor/turbine buildings, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> trench areas, {{were made on}} 18 April. These robotic {{measurements}} indicated up to 49mSv/h in unit 1 and 57mSv/h in unit 3. This is substantially lower than the basement and trench readings, but still exceeds safe working levels without constant worker rotation. Inside primary containment, levels are much higher.|$|E
50|$|The area {{also has}} a 14 stories high building, named Ostkupan http://ostkupan.se/ ("The cheese cover") with about 360 students, and its own pub <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> Coca-Cola <b>and</b> Arla has large {{facilities}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district as well.|$|R
50|$|Scattered {{around the}} {{district}} are other building types, primarily institutional. They {{range from the}} 34-story Smith Building at the northeast corner and the brick structures of the former Hinckel Brewery on Park Avenue to the six churches, most notably the Wilborn Temple on Lancaster Street, whose tower is a secondary {{focal point of the}} district after the Smith Building. Although most commercial use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district is of mixed-use character, occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> at street level of otherwise residential rowhouses, there are some historic commercial buildings, as well as larger modern, non-contributing development like supermarkets and gas stations.|$|R
50|$|They {{spent two}} years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Third Division before being relegated, but the board kept faith in Walker, even though Aldershot {{struggled}} back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> division <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 1990 only just avoided relegation to the Conference National.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} {{also features}} 74 S.R.O. hotel rooms where artists in residence reside. In 2003, then-Mayor Jerry Brown proposed expanding his Oakland School for the Arts, {{which was at}} the time housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> first floor of the Alice Street building, to the entire six-floor center. Numerous hotel rooms were withheld and kept vacant while plans were made to displace the artist tenants from their S.R.O. hotel rooms and studios in the center.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} originally {{housed the}} Titche-Goettinger Department Store (later known as Titche's) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> first two levels; upper levels housed offices accessed through a lobby on Main Street. Prior to the building's opening, most of Dallas retail traffic was centered several {{blocks to the}} west. The success of the Wilson Building and Titche-Goettinger convinced Neiman Marcus to build their flagship store across Main Street and forever changed the city's retailing history.|$|E
25|$|Sandoval {{stated that}} she was {{employed}} from approximately 1987 to 1993, four years before Gibbons left for Washington in 1997, after his 1996 election as a Congressman and five years before Dawn Gibbons became a state legislator. Sandoval also stated {{that she was}} asked to hide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> refrain from answering doors at certain times {{in order to ensure that}} her illegal status did not become public knowledge and jeopardize Gibbons' political career.|$|E
50|$|The {{floors of}} <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> upper floors were poured in 20.5 sq ft slabs. These slabs were 11 <b>in</b> thick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> first floor, and 9.5 in thick on all other floors. The roof was a 7.5 in slab. Spandrel beams {{were not used}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{flooring}} system. The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted {{to do away with}} column caps in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support. Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a creosote-impregnated wood block.|$|R
50|$|The Tribune {{occupied}} its own three-story {{building at}} 1110 12th Street, with <b>the</b> press room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> circulation <b>and</b> advertising {{on the first}} floor, the editorial department {{on the second floor}} and the composing room on the third floor.|$|R
50|$|Today, The Brook Green Hotel is a pub {{on ground}} level, {{along with a}} {{cocktail}} bar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> below <b>and</b> a hotel upstairs. The Queen's Head public house overlooks the green itself at the front and has a garden at the back.|$|R
25|$|According to Human Rights Watch on 2 August, {{the initial}} {{estimate}} of 54 persons killed {{was based on}} a register of 63 persons who had sought shelter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> the rescue teams first having located only nine survivors. However, it was later established that 22 had escaped the basement and that 28 bodies had been recovered, of whom 16 were children. There were still 13 people missing, and locals feared they were buried in the rubble.|$|E
25|$|After {{six weeks}} of captivity, {{in an act of}} despair, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella's penis before {{screaming}} he could not continue to tolerate being treated in this manner. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb, then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson's body was later dismembered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> his head initially stored in a plastic bag inside Berdella's freezer, before being buried in the backyard.|$|E
25|$|Some 19th-century barns {{found in}} other parts of the U.S. may have some {{similarities}} with the New England barn but are distinctly different. The Pennsylvania barn has doors on the sidewall like the English barn but is a larger, bank barn with the cows housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> has one or more distinctive forebays (cantilevered walls). The New World Dutch barn (Dutch barn) has similarities to the New England barn with the barn doors on the gable ends, but the Dutch barns are a much older type and are framed with the classic anchor beam framing. Dutch barns are ground barns.|$|E
50|$|By 2000, {{the east}} {{entrance}} hall at Memorial Amphitheater was suffering water damage {{and other problems}} yet again. Congress appropriated $800,000 in fiscal year 2001 to identify what fixes might be needed. Repairs were made in 2006, which included ameliorating water damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> first floor, <b>and</b> second floor; repairing and improving roof and exterior drainage; and installing new waterproofing and drains to prevent flooding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> women's restroom <b>and</b> chapel.|$|R
