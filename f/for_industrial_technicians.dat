40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} the development of a diagnosis methodology for industrial manufacturing systems. The aim of the project is to support technicians that supervise the manufacturing plant to identify the causes of faults and failures on the machine and, in particular, to indicate a procedure for the recovery of its working condition. The requirements described in the paper have been defined giving particular care to the peculiarities of the application domain, in order to allow the design of a powerful, but easy to use <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>technicians,</b> diagnostic system...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{proposed}} to estimate {{committed information rate}} (CIR) variations in typical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless local area networks (WLANs) that are applied in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and operate within the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency bands. The method {{is based on the}} observation of a phenomenon of which the significance has not previously been recognized nor documented; here termed the service level differential zone (SLDZ). This method, which conforms to the ITU-T Y. 1564 test methodology, provides the means to set a committed information rate (CIR) reference for IEEE 802. 11 a/g/n OFDM systems in terms of committed throughput bandwidth between a test node and an access point (AP) at a specific range. An analytical approach is presented to determine the relationship between the maximum operating range (in metres) of a wireless sensor network for a specific committed throughput bandwidth, and its link budget (in dB). The most significant contributions of this paper are the analytical tools to determine wireless network capabilities, variations and performance in a simplified method, which does not require specialized measurement equipment. With these it becomes possible <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>technicians</b> and engineers (who are not necessarily information technology (IT) network experts) to field analyze OFDM WLANs and so qualify their performance in terms of Y. 1564 specified service level agreement (SLA) requirements, as well as in terms of the widely acceptable sensitivity/SINAD parameters...|$|E
50|$|The {{university}} {{began as}} the Daido Technical-Educational Foundation in 1939. In 1969, the school became the Daido Institute of Technology. The university traces its origin {{back to the}} companies founded by Momosuke Fukuzawa. These companies consist of the Great Consolidated Electric Power Company, Limited (current: Kansai Electric Power Company and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc.), the Nisshinbo Industries, Toho Gas Co., Ltd., Daido Steel Co., Ltd., Toagosei and Nagoya Railroad Co., Ltd. (Meitetsu), etc. He had a concept of a research institute <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>technician</b> trainings. The president of Daido Steel, Yoshio Shimoide (a member of the Japanese Diet), was inspired by his concept. In January 1939, Daido Technical-Educational Foundation was established by Yoshio Simoide.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop and verify a list of the job duties and tasks of <b>industrial</b> {{plastics}} <b>technicians</b> <b>for</b> use in developing plastics education and training programs which meet the needs of the greater Michiana area plastics industry;Research questions were as follows: (1) What tasks are considered to be essential to the success of the <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> in the greater Michiana area? (2) What tasks are considered to be performed by entry-level <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area? (3) What is the degree of importance of each task? (4) What is the frequency of performance of each task? (5) What is the degree of difficulty in learning each task?;An occupational analysis was conducted using <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process. One hundred and thirty-five (135) tasks in thirteen (13) duties or general areas of responsibility were identified;Questions were developed utilizing the 135 tasks. Respondents were asked to determine whether each task is expected of entry-level <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians.</b> Respondents rated each task for importance, frequency of performance and difficulty in learning on a four-point Likert-type rating scale;The findings indicated the following: (1) The use of the DACUM process was appropriate to develop a task list <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area. (2) The <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> job is varied and consists of 13 broad areas of expertise or duties. (3) The 135 identified tasks are the basic performances required for adequate preparation to enter employment as an <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> in the greater Michiana area. (4) No competency was rated 2 ̆ 2 unimportant, 2 ̆ 2 therefore, it was concluded that an adequate curriculum <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area must include all of the 135 identified tasks. (5) <b>Industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> students or trainees in the greater Michiana area should be able to master all of the 135 tasks identified by this study. (6) <b>Industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area should be required to use most of the 135 tasks identified shortly after their initial job entry and should have mastered each competency in their job setting prior to full employment...|$|R

It exposes its students to entrepreneurial and industrial work and enables them to imbibe a keen sense of responsibility to the community. The center is recognized by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) as delivering institution for technical vocational education programs. In 1999, CIT was identified by TESDA as Center <b>for</b> Excellence in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Technician</b> Education. The center offers four three-year programs based on TESDA training regulations. Students who complete the programs are eligible to take the TESDA National Certificate (NC) examinations for the qualifications embedded in each program.|$|R
40|$|Our {{maintenance}} workforce {{is getting}} older. And the qualified applicants for maintenance jobs are getting fewer. Where {{do we find}} our replacement maintenance technicians? How do we prepare them for these jobs?” These questions have been {{and will continue to}} be front and center in every maintenance manager’s mind. Competition <b>for</b> top-skilled maintenance <b>industrial</b> <b>technicians</b> has exploded. The sources of qualified recruits have dwindled and are overtaxed. And yet our manufacturing plants, commercial and industrial facilities and our transportations fleets still need qualified technicians to assure their continued performance and reliability. The era of maintenance skills shortages has been growing for more than two decades. It’s because of the “perfect storm ” conditions I’ve discussed in previous columns: aging Baby Boomers, fewer young people entering careers in industrial maintenance, precipitous decline of vocational-technical education in our schools and an overemphasis on a college education by our society, our politicians and our schools. Couple these conditions with the myth that manufacturing is on the way out in America and you have the “perfect storm. ” Riding this one out will take foresight, planning, out-ofthe-box thinking and leadership...|$|R

The group included Manuel Navarro Ballesteros, who later would direct Mundo Obrero. Checa acquired some theoretical background with this group, and with them joined the Spanish Communist Party soon after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. His decision was due to the influence of José Díaz Ramos. Checa had great capacity for work, and was also very shy.While he was a militant in the PCE he always had a reputation as an honest and hard working person.He was among the most respected of the militants.|$|R
