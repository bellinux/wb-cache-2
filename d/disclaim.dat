5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly {{in one hand}} and a battle axe in the other. Despite <b>disclaim</b> of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the {{condition}} that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to <b>disclaim</b> their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

25|$|Ruskin {{had made}} his debut as a critic of {{architecture}} with The Poetry of Architecture (1839), an essay in the picturesque that he later rejected, The Seven Lamps were still tentative steps for Ruskin's architectural criticism and offered a moral creed for architects. He later went on to <b>disclaim</b> the essay as a 'wretched rant'.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{eventually}} {{admitted to the}} House of Lords in 1958. The Life Peerages Act passed that year permitted the creation of life baronies {{for both men and}} women on a regular basis. Hereditary peeresses were admitted in 1963 under the Peerage Act. The Peerage Act also permitted peers to <b>disclaim</b> hereditary peerages within a year of succeeding to them, or within a year of attaining the age of majority. All eligible Scottish peers were permitted to sit in the House of Lords, and elections for representative peers ceased. Elections for Irish representative peers had already ended in 1922, when most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become the Irish Free State.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We <b>disclaim</b> alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E

50|$|In estate or {{inheritance}} law, {{a disclaimer}} (also called disclaimer of interest) is a written document voluntarily signed by an heir to an estate {{in which the}} said heir does not accept (<b>disclaims)</b> {{the part of the}} estate of a deceased person which the heir is entitled to receive. The <b>disclaimed</b> part of the estate is then inherited not necessarily by a person of the <b>disclaiming</b> heir's choice, but by the next heir in line to receive that part of the estate as if the <b>disclaiming</b> heir were also deceased, either according to the will, beneficiary designation, or the laws of intestacy. Government tax agencies have further rules on such disclaimers. Reasons for such disclaimers may include imminent death of the disclaimant or the fact that the disclaimant already has enough wealth.|$|R

The editorial defended the newspaper's critical stance: [...] "We <b>disclaim</b> all hostile feelings against Mr. Sewell ... we have not decided to thwart but to understand him." [...] The editor welcomed Sewell's detailed address and expressed general satisfaction with Sewell's statements.

500|$|On November 1, 1989, the Court of Appeals {{rejected}} the suit {{on the grounds}} that the owners were covered by the labor exemption from antitrust law. The union's next tactic, in November 1989, was to <b>disclaim</b> any interest in representing NFL players in collective bargaining and to reform itself as a professional organization. Having done that, individual players, led by Freeman McNeil of the New York Jets, brought a new antitrust action, challenging the NFL's so-called [...] "Plan B" [...] free agency, which gave teams a right of first refusal to sign a player, as an unlawful practice under the antitrust acts.|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{discussed}} {{the persecution of}} the Jews in Germany and the emigration of Jews from Europe to Palestine through his lens of Satyagraha. In 1937, Gandhi discussed Zionism with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach. He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that [...] "the Jews should <b>disclaim</b> any intention of realizing their aspiration {{under the protection of}} arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion is ripe for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Further, the Acting State Secretary [...] "was {{definitely}} not authorized" [...] {{and did not}} have [...] "the legal capacity to write the 1953 letter, or to renounce, <b>disclaim,</b> or confirm title of any part of the territories of Johor". Under two treaties of 21 January 1948, the Johor Agreement between the British Crown and the Sultan of Johor and the Federation of Malaya Agreement between the British Crown and nine Malay States including Johor, Johor transferred all its rights, power and jurisdiction on matters relating to defence and external affairs to the United Kingdom. These powers were exercisable by the Federal High Commissioner appointed by the United Kingdom and not by the Johor State Secretary. The Acting State Secretary had improperly taken it upon himself to reply to the Colonial Secretary's letter and had not submitted a copy of it to the Chief Secretary of Johor. There was no evidence that the Chief Secretary or the High Commissioner was aware of its contents.|$|E
