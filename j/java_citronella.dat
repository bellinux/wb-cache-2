40|$|<b>Java</b> <b>citronella</b> (Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt) is {{member of}} the Poaceae family. <b>Java</b> <b>citronella</b> {{volatile}} oil {{has been reported to}} be among the volatile oils, showing repellent, antimycotic, and acaricide activities. It has been known that agronomical factors have a great effect on both {{the quality and quantity of}} essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to determine optimum levels of agronomical factors affecting plant growth and production. Harvest time and drying are very important agronomical factors. This study has been conducted in the Research farm of the " Universidade Federal de Sergipe", Agronomical Engineering Department along 2002 - 2003 on the base of factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with three replications. <b>Java</b> <b>citronella</b> was cultivated in a 60 x 60 cm space. Early, midday, and late harvest at 9 : 00 h, 12 : 00 h, and 15 : 00 h were conducted on four different seasons. Fresh and dried leaves were used on the experiments. In order to study the effects of harvest time and drying, yields of dry and fresh herbage (kg/ha), moisture content (%), volatile oil content (%) and yield (L/ha), and chemical composition of the volatile oil were measured. Seasonal changes had significant effect on yield of fresh herbage, yield and volatile oil content. Maximum volatile oil yields were observed at 9 : 00 during summer, winter, and spring. Volatile oil content was influenced by season and drying, but not influenced by harvest time...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted for 2 years (1993 - 95) at Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Field Station, Bangalore, India {{to evaluate the}} nitrification inhibitors, benzotriazole, o-nitrophenol, m-nitroaniline and dicyandiamide in a perennial aromatic grass, <b>Java</b> <b>citronella.</b> Citronella responded to applications of high doses of nitrogen (300 kg N/ha/year). The interaction between N doses and nitrification inhibitors was significant. Nitrification inhibitors performed better at the highest N dose (450 kg N/ha/year) {{and the increase in}} the essential oil yields was to an extent of 27. 3 to 34. 6 when compared with 'N alone' treatment. The nitrification inhibitors also increased the apparent N recoveries by citronella considerably. The oil content in the herb and its quality were not affected by the treatments. The nitrification inhibitors increased citronella yields and improved N economy...|$|E
40|$|Characterisation and {{catalytic}} ativities {{investigation of}} modified natural zeolite on cyclisation acetylation reaction of (R) -(+) -citronellal was performed. The experimental work involved isolation of (R) -(+) -citronellal from <b>Java</b> <b>Citronella</b> oil (Cymbopogon winterianus) by vacuum fractional distillation, determination of its enantiomer, preparation and characterisation of different catalysts i. e. H-natural zeolite (H-Za), Fe 3 +-natural zeolite (Fe 3 +-Za), and Zn 2 +-natural zeolite (Zn 2 +-Za), followed by examination of catalytic activity and selectivity. Isolated citronellal contained 88. 21 % ee of (R) -(+) -citronellal. The main products of cyclisation-acetylation of (R) -(+) -citronellal was IPA (isopulegyl acetate) and NIPA (neo-isopulegyl acetate). Although the highest yield of IPA and NIPA {{was obtained by}} Fe 3 +-Za catalyst (78. 69 %) at 80 oC and 120 min, the stereoselectivity of Fe 3 +-Za slightly {{lower than that of}} Zn 2 +-Za. Structure elucidation of citronellal and products was carried out by means of GC and GC-MS. Lewis acidity plays the role of acetyl ionic formation from acetic anhydride. The Activity and stereoselectivity of catalysts depended on Lewis acidity and cation distribution on the catalyst surface. © 2014 BCREC UNDIP.

40|$|Aromatic {{plants from}} the Plateau des Cataractes (Congo Basin). Chemotype {{characterization}} of essential oil of Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle acclimatized in Congo-Brazzaville. Description. The essential oils of Cymbopogon nardus (L.) Rendle, Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) Wats and Cymbopogon citratus L. (DC.) Stapf (lemongrass) consist {{of more than}} 80 % of the following constituents: citronellal, geraniol, citral, citronellol, geranyl acetate, and limonene. For the purposes of business transactions, it is therefore important to know the exact chemical composition of the essential oils produced. Objectives. Chemotype evaluation of C. nardus acclimatized on the Plateau des Cataractes. Method. The essential oils of C. nardus were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by chromatography (GC and GC/MS) {{over a period of}} more than ten years. Results. Cymbopogon nardus was found to produce a <b>Java</b> type <b>citronella</b> essential oil (C. winterianus) with the following profile: citronellal (40 - 48 %), geraniol (10 - 22 %), citronellol (10 - 12 %), limonene (2 - 3 %), geranyl acetate (1 - 2 %), linalool (1 %). The difference between these two types of <b>citronella,</b> <b>Java</b> and Ceylon, was based on the relative proportions of their three main constituents: citronellal, geraniol and citronellol. Cymbopogon nardus is known for its high variability, with two varieties and sept subvarieties. Conclusions. The citronella established in West and Central Africa under the name of Cymbopogon nardus (Java type) could be considered a Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, based on the chemical composition of its essential oil...|$|R
30|$|FT-IR {{spectroscopy}} {{analysis of}} non-recyclable paper waste and cow dung {{has been observed}} by Gupta and Garg (2009). The FT-IR spectra confirmed reduction in aliphatic compounds in the final vermicomposted mixtures. The band height reduction at 3100 – 3600  cm− 1 was observed in the vermicomposted samples as compared {{to that in the}} raw waste. Decrease in peak intensities of final vermicomposted samples at 2783 – 2879  cm− 1 in the aliphatic region confirms decomposition of aliphatic compounds. Deka et al. (2011) applied FT-IR spectroscopy in distillation waste biomass of <b>java</b> <b>citronella</b> (Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt.). The authors confirmed that the FT-IR spectra of final vermicomposted mixtures revealed increased nitrogen compounds and decreased aliphatic and aromatic compounds as compared to the pre-vermicomposted waste mixtures which indicate degradation of biowaste during vermicomposting process. In vermicomposted samples, the presence of less intensity of peak for CH 2 and CH 3 at 2915 and 2846  cm− 1 indicates the decrease of aliphatic compounds which indicates the stabilization or decomposition of biowaste material. Ali et al. (2012) applied FT-IR spectroscopy in vegetable waste, tree leaves, saw dust and cow dung mixtures using rotary drum composting process. The results confirmed that the seasonal variation and composting time determines the decrease in aliphatic and polysaccharide components. Lv et al. (2013) applied FT-IR spectra on water extractable organic matter (WEOM) extracted from vermicomposting process of cattle dung. The results indicated a decreasing trend of aliphatic C–H stretching at 2936 – 2958  cm− 1 that confirms lipids and carbohydrate degradation. In general, decrease of aliphatic compounds, N-containing groups, carbohydrates and enrichment of aromatic components in the WEOM confirmed the organics transformation and maturity during the vermicomposting of cattle dung.|$|E
