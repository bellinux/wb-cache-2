40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{performance}} of active sustainable solar still was studied. A conventional <b>greenhouse</b> <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> coupled with a flat-plate solar collector and photovoltaic (PV) system was built and tested. The sun tracking system was designed for the solar collector to track the sun position and to heat up the water flowing through the collector. This helps to further increase the water temperature in solar still basin and increase the daily yield of distilled water. The system consists of a solar still, a flat-plate collector, and a PV module to provide power supply to all the electrical components in the control system. Two-axis tracking was built to control {{the direction of the}} solar collector. The system was tested in Kuching (01 &# 0176; 33 ' N, 110 &# 0176; 25 ' E), (Sarawak, Malaysia) in different weather conditions. The obtained results show that there is a significant growth in the experimental thermal efficiency of the active solar still with sun-tracking (38. 55 %) as compared to the passive one (22. 70 %). Its efficiency is even higher as compared to active the non-sun-tracking solar stills (34. 70 %). This proves that solar collector with sun-tracking can indeed improve {{the performance of}} a solar still. In addition there is a small increase of 3. 98 % in the still efficiency for active solar still with sun-tracking (38. 55 %) as compared to the non-sun-tracking (34. 70 %). Comparisons between theoretical and experimental results are also presented...|$|E

30|$|Further {{attempts}} have been made by researchers to investigate the effect of water depth in double-slope single-basin <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> A digital simulation method has been done for the productivity of a complicated still by Cooper [16], and the influence of more common variables such as water depth, wind velocity, still insulation, double glass cover, cover slope, and daily variability on the productivity has been investigated. Results of the simulation indicate that water depth and thermal insulation have little effect on the productivity at shallow water depth and that a double glass cover and high cover slopes are not justifiable. Garg and Mann [17] have investigated the effect of climatic, operational, and design parameters for single- and double-slope <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> under the Indian arid zone regions and to find the effect of all possible variables on the performance of the single-effect <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> Akash et al. [18] have studied the basin-type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> under local climatic conditions and concluded that lower water depth and salinity of the brine produced higher distillate yields for the double-slope passive <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> The effect of wind speed on daily productivity of some active and passive <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> using computer simulation for different <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> designs has been studied by El-Sebaii [19]. It has been shown that for the active and multi-effective passive stills, daily productivity increases with the increase of wind velocity up to a typical velocity; beyond that, the productivity becomes insignificant for single-effect passive stills. Al-Hinani et al. [20] have studied the effect of climatic, design, and operational parameters such as solar intensity, wind velocity, ambient temperature, glass cover slope angle, feedwater temperature water depth on the basin, and basin material on the distillate output of the basin-type <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> They found that the 23 Â° cover tilt angle, 0.1 -m insulation thickness, and asphalt coating of <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> of the shallow water basin are the optimum parameters for producing higher yields. Al-Hayeka and Badran [21] have found the productivity of freshwater of two different designs of stills, which are asymmetric greenhouse with mirror and symmetric <b>greenhouse</b> <b>solar</b> <b>stills,</b> under the climatic conditions of Jordan. It was inferred that the distilled water output of the asymmetric greenhouse type was 20 % higher than that of the symmetric greenhouse type. Mowla and Karimi [22] have simulated a mathematical model for a solar still; the rate of production of freshwater has been calculated, and experiments have been carried out in Shiraz. It has been found that the experimental and calculated results are in good agreement. The effect of water depth on the transient performance of a double-basin <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> has been investigated by Tiwari and Tiwari [23].|$|R

For comparing the productivity of <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> with and without LHTESS a <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is designed, fabricated. Experiments are conducted in hot and humid climate of Chennai, India. It is found that there is an increase of production of fresh water with decrease in water mass. There is an increase of about 35 % in production of fresh water with LHTESS than that of <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> without LHTESS. Also it was found that during the off shine period the fresh water produced from the still is higher compared to higher water mass.

30|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>solar</b> {{distillation}} <b>stills</b> that have been devised for converting available brackish or waste water into potable water. The horizontal basin-type still is one of these. And because of its low productivity, it is not commonly used. On the other hand, tilted <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> heat up more rapidly, operate at higher mean temperatures, have lower thermal capacity, and produce somewhat more potable water. There are also other types of <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> that have been evolved, such as multistage flash distillation <b>stills</b> and <b>solar</b> concentrator <b>stills.</b> Previous work on <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> by researchers in the open literature {{is divided into two}} sections: experimental and numerical as described hereafter.|$|R

The <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> base was coated with granular activated carbon(GAC) for enhancing the evaporation rate. The solar-pond was used to pre-heat the inlet water supplied to <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> 0. 01 m water depth was maintained in the <b>solar</b> <b>still.</b> Physical modelling of solar-pond was done in matlab to determine the optimum salinity level required for the bottom layer of solar-pond which is the heat storing zone. From the simulated results we found that 50 g/Kg salinity is the optimal value that should be maintained at the bottom layer of the solar-pond...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â The thermal {{performance}} of the stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is affected by design, climatic and operational parameters. The design parameters affecting {{the performance of a}} stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> are depth of water, thickness of glass cover, insulation thickness, condensing cover material, shape of the absorber surface, absorbing material provided over the basin surface, angle of inclination of the still, enhancement of heat transfer etc. The climatic parameters include solar intensity, ambient temperature and wind velocity. The effect of various climatic parameters listed above on the distillate yield of different designs of stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> is presented in this paper. In this work, four number of stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>stills</b> with different designs have been selected for studying the effect of climatic parameters like solar intensity, ambient temperature and wind velocity. The absorber area of each stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> is 0. 5093 m 2. After conducting experiments for the different designs of stepped type <b>solar</b> <b>still,</b> it has been observed that the intensity of solar radiation goes on increasing from the morning hours with maximum occurring at noon and then it goes on decreasing in the afternoon hours. The hourly variation in ambient temperature follows the same trend as that of solar intensity. It has been observed that the distillate yield increases with increase in solar intensity and ambient air temperature. Also it has been observed that as the wind velocity over the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> increases, the distillate yield of the <b>solar</b> <b>still</b> increases continuously...|$|R
