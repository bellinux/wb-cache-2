The Third Class section was moved amidships and expanded, and a refrigerated cargo room was added. The bridge was moved up one deck. Nordnorge was fitted with an <b>echo</b> <b>sounder,</b> an electric logbook and radio telephone.|$|E
25|$|Sound waves travel {{differently}} through fish {{than through}} water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder {{has a different}} density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.|$|E

25|$|The plan {{to salvage}} Pasha Bulker used anchors laid out at sea, which {{the ship was}} to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it {{with the aim of}} {{dragging}} the bow over a rock reef. The carrier would then be pulled seaward in a path between two rocky reefs. A hydrographic survey was conducted to survey and map {{the bottom of the ocean}} through the surf zone using a surf ski single beam <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> and GPS. This gave the salvage team more insight into the direction for refloating the ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|E
40|$|By {{simulating}} {{the sound}} field of a round piston transducer with the Kirchhoff integral theorem and analyzing {{the shape of}} ultrasound beams and propagation characteristics in a metal container wall, this study presents a model for calculating the <b>echo</b> <b>sound</b> pressure by using the Kirchhoff paraxial approximation theory, based on which and according to different ultrasonic impedance between gas and liquid media, a method for detecting the liquid level from outside of sealed containers is proposed. Then, the proposed method is evaluated through two groups of experiments. In the first group, three kinds of liquid media with different ultrasonic impedance are used as detected objects; the <b>echo</b> <b>sound</b> pressure is calculated by using the proposed model under conditions of four sets of different wall thicknesses. The changing characteristics of the <b>echo</b> <b>sound</b> pressure in the entire detection process are analyzed, {{and the effects of}} different ultrasonic impedance of liquids on the <b>echo</b> <b>sound</b> pressure are compared. In the second group, taking water as an example, two transducers with different radii are selected to measure the liquid level under four sets of wall thickness. Combining with sound field characteristics, the influence of different size transducers on the pressure calculation and detection resolution are discussed and analyzed. Finally, the experimental results indicate that measurement uncertainly is better than ± 5 mm, which meets the industrial inspection requirements...|$|R

25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable <b>echo</b> <b>sounder,</b> the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E
