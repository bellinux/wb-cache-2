Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests,</b> where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E

40|$|Software-defect {{detection}} is {{an increasingly}} important research topic in software engineering. To detect defects in a program, static verification and <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> generation are two important proposed techniques. However, both of these techniques face their respective issues. Static verification produces false positives, {{and on the other}} hand, <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> generation is often time consuming. To address the limitations of static verification and <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> generation, we present an automated defect-detection tool, called DyTa, that combines both static verification and <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> generation. DyTa consists of a static phase and a dynamic phase. The static phase detects potential defects with a static checker; the <b>dynamic</b> phase generates <b>test</b> inputs through <b>dynamic</b> symbolic execution to confirm these potential defects. DyTa reduces the number of false positives compared to static verification and performs more efficiently compared to <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> generation...|$|R

2500|$|When the Uhlan gear was {{incorporated}} in the Mark 14 design, the pressure sensing port for the depth mechanism was moved from its position on the cylindrical body to the cone-shaped tail section; the designers {{did not realize that}} move would affect the pressure readings. This repositioning meant that when the torpedo was moving, a hydrodynamic flow effect created a substantially lower pressure at the port than hydrostatic depth pressure. [...] The torpedo's depth control engine therefore thought the torpedo was too shallow depth and responded by trimming the torpedo to run deeper. A laboratory test (such as immersing a non-moving torpedo in a pool of water) would not be subject to the flow-induced pressure change and would show the torpedo trimmed at the desired depth. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> using exercise heads with depth and roll recorders would have shown the depth problem, but the depth measuring port suffered from the same placement problem and gave consistent (though incorrect) measurements. The problem was also exacerbated by higher speeds. The depth problem was finally addressed in the last half of 1943 by relocating the sensor point to the midbody of the torpedo where hydrodynamic effects were minimized.|$|E

Fifty-four children participated in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> procedure, which used a pretest–posttest training design.

The suitability of the procedure was measured by several behavioral outcome scores, the recording of which was made possible by the use of sensor technology.

40|$|Testing {{concurrent}} programs {{remains a}} difficult task due to the non-deterministic nature of concurrent execution. Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the complexity of uncovering potential concurrency bugs. Static analysis tackles the problem by analyzing a concurrent program looking for situations/patterns {{that might lead to}} possible errors during execution. In general, static analysis cannot precisely locate all possible concurrent errors. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> examines and controls a program during its execution also looking for situations/patterns that might lead to possible errors during execution. In general, <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> needs to examine all possible execution paths to detect all errors, which is intractable. Motivated by these observation, a new testing technique is developed that uses a collaboration between static analysis and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> to find the first potential error but using less time and space. In the new collaboration scheme, static analysis and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> interact iteratively throughout the testing process. Static analysis provides coarse-grained flow-information to guide the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> through the relevant search space, while <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> collects concrete runtime-information during the guided exploration. The concrete runtime-information provides feedback to the static analysis to refine its analysis, which is then feed forward to provide more precise guidance of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing.</b> The new collaborative technique is able to uncover the first concurrency-related bug in a program faster using less storage than the state-of-the-art dynamic testing-tool Java PathFinder. The implementation of the collaborative technique consists of a static-analysis module based on Soot and a dynamic-analysis module based on Java PathFinder...|$|R
