40|$|This {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} survey study about didactic and clinical education <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders <b>in</b> higher education. Two previous survey studies (Yaruss, 1999 and Yaruss & Quesal, 2002) indicated {{that there have been}} reductions in didactic and clinical requirements <b>in</b> education <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders following revisions in the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) Certification of Clinical Competence (CCC) standards for speech-language pathology. The current study investigated trends and continuing changes <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders education since ASHA introduced new revised CCC standards in 2014. The study surveyed 282 undergraduate and graduate schools and asked about their didactic and clinical curriculum, as well as their faculty’s interest in and knowledge about the field of fluency disorders. Findings indicate that programs have tried to accommodate the changes in the field by increasing their academic coursework and including more practical sessions and competency-based testing in class. The number of faculty teaching courses and supervising clinical practicum who possess extensive clinical experience has decreased. An increase in clinical requirements <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders was detected, but the number of programs providing insufficient clinical practicum <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders is still high. In order to raise students’ confidence and competence level <b>in</b> <b>fluency</b> disorders, extra efforts beyond graduate work or systemic changes in the field may be necessary...|$|R
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style.

5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase <b>fluency</b> <b>in</b> some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{establish}} normative {{parameters for}} the F-A-S {{form of the}} phonemic verbal <b>fluency</b> test, <b>in</b> a population of Brazilian Portuguese speaking adults with high-level literacy. Methods: The sample comprised 40 male and female volunteers aged 19 to 59 years, and at least 8 years of formal education. Volunteers were first submitted to the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clock Drawing cognitive screening tests, then to the F-A-S Verbal Phonemic <b>Fluency</b> Test; <b>in</b> this test, examinees were given 60 seconds to generate as many words as possible beginning {{with each of the}} three test letters. Results: The means for number of words beginning the letters F, A and S and for total number of words beginning with either letter generated per minute corresponded to 15. 3, 14. 4, 13. 9 and 43. 5, respectively. Conclusion: Reference values obtained from young adults with high levels of literacy submitted to the F-A-S Verbal Phonemic <b>Fluency</b> Test <b>in</b> this study were similar to those reported in the international literature.

5|$|At {{this stage}} in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech {{language}} was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue.

He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his <b>fluency</b> <b>in</b> the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper Národní listy.

However, damage to this particular tract is not robustly associated with verbal fluency decline at this stage of disease...|$|R

5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language.

5|$|Milford Haven {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although {{it is the most}} westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5% of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read and write the language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18% of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40% of people express a similar level of <b>fluency</b> <b>in</b> Welsh. Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline.

Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his <b>fluency</b> <b>in</b> several local languages.|$|E
