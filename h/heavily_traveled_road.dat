5|$|The daily {{traffic of}} Juniata County's {{arterial}} roads ranges from several dozen to several thousand vehicles per day. Pennsylvania Route 75 carries 50 vehicles {{per day in}} the southwestern {{part of the county}} and 7,000 vehicles per day in the northeastern part of the county. Pennsylvania Route 104 carries 2,900 vehicles per day in the county. The most <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>road</b> there, however, is U.S. Route 22/U.S. Route 322, which carries 11,000 to 18,000 vehicles per day. The least-trafficked major rural connector road is State Route 2026, which is used by 350 vehicles per day and the most-trafficked major rural connector road is Pennsylvania Route 35, which gets up to 7100 vehicles per day. Traffic on minor rural collector roads ranges from 100 vehicles per day on Academia Road to over 1000 vehicles per day on several roads. The volume of vehicle traffic in the county has changed little since the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In the Poconos, in Carbon County, The Mansion Hill (SR 209) exiting Jim Thorpe towards Lehighton {{was closed}} {{for most of the}} 14th due to snow slides {{blocking}} the major artery or tractor-trailer trucks becoming stuck and blocking the travel lanes. The road reopened about 2:30 PM on the 14th, however it was shut down again at 3:06 PM due to an accident. This was a main trouble spot as the snow and sleet reportedly drifted on the hill across part of the highway. Drifts were reported to be higher than some vehicles. At 8:20 AM on the 14th, it was decided that drifting was occurring more frequently than road crews could clear, resulting in the <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>road</b> being closed. All schools in the county canceled classes as early as the evening of the 13th. Lansford continued their state of emergency on the 15th, which was issued on the 14th. This means that all non-essential travel should be avoided. One accident occurred when a tractor-trailer jack-knifed on the Mansion House Hill, Route 209, in Jim Thorpe at about 4 AM on the 14th. The Pennsylvania Turnpikes Lehighton interchange was closed because of a tractor-trailer crash on the 14th, and state police closed Interstate 81 late in the afternoon of the 14th, deeming it impassable. Interstate 380 also was closed because of bad road conditions.|$|E
5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>road</b> between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} amount of road building occurred in the area just prior to and after the township's organization. By 1806, Newburgh Street (today's Woodhill Road and E. 93rd Street) had opened on the ridge between the grist mill and Doan's Corners. This area was now well-settled, with numerous farms and orchards alongside {{both sides of the}} road. The Newburgh Road (today's Broadway Avenue below E. 34th Street; {{not to be confused with}} Newburgh Street) and Pittsburgh Street (today's Broadway Avenue above E. 34th Street) were constructed about the same time. The Newburgh Road was the most <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>road</b> between Cleveland and Newburgh, made even more so by the opening of Ontario Street in 1812 (which connected Newburgh Road to Cleveland's Public Square). The Aurora Road (now Miles Avenue and Ohio State Route 43) opened about 1812 as well, although it was abandoned by 1820.|$|E
500|$|In Dominica, high waves {{damaged the}} island's western coastal highway, leaving the most <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>road</b> {{temporarily}} closed.

Damage on the island totaled $21.5million. Rainfall of around [...] reached {{as far south as}} Martinique, where one person was killed. Further south, high waves in Saint Lucia washed away beaches, a seawall, and coastal walkways. At least 40houses were damaged along the coast, which left several families homeless.

50|$|The north-south Interstate 79 and {{the east-west}} Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) both run through Cranberry Township. U.S. Route 19 and Pennsylvania Route 228 are also {{important}} arterial roads in the municipality. All four roads are connected by an interchange, a $44.3 million PennDOT/Pennsylvania Turnpike venture which opened in 2004 to provide direct, non-stop connection between those <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>roads.</b> Access to the northern terminus of Interstate 279, an important artery {{that serves as a}} direct expressway to downtown Pittsburgh from the north, is located 6 miles (10 km) south of the township.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, these roads did not {{directly}} intersect but were linked by a cloverleaf interchange. Delmont became known for this interchange; many local merchants incorporated [...] "Cloverleaf" [...] into their business names as a result. Recently, the [...] "cloverleaf" [...] system was dismantled and a single-point urban interchange was built in its place. This change was made to accommodate a plan to widen Route 22, {{which is one of}} the most <b>heavily</b> <b>traveled</b> <b>roads</b> in Pennsylvania.

50|$|Turning southwest, {{the road}} crossed the Potomac River {{and entered the}} Shenandoah Valley near present-day Martinsburg, West Virginia.

The Shenandoah portion of the road {{is also known as}} the Valley Pike. The Treaty of Lancaster in 1744 had established colonists' rights to settle along the Indian Road. Although traffic on the road increased dramatically after 1744, it was reduced to a trickle during the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) from 1756 to 1763.
