5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque was {{commissioned}} by the Caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah for the newly established capital city of Cairo. Its name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to the name of Fatima Al-Azhar, {{the daughter of the}} Prophet Mohammed. Jawhar al-Siqilli, commander of the Fatimid army started construction of the mosque in 970. It was the first mosque established in the city.

A waqf for the mosque was established in 1009 by Caliph al-Hakim.|$|E

5|$|The Mazurka was {{composed}} in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to Chopin, and contains {{echoes of the}} earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and {{may have had a}} Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{striking}} {{scene has}} been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of The Science of Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to the painting by artist Paul Kidby, who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists. Shelagh Stephenson's play An Experiment with an Air Pump, inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 Margaret Ramsay Award and had its premiere at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in 1998.|$|E

5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other film tie-in games, which often closely follow {{the events of}} their source material, the development team of Escape from Butcher Bay focused on differentiating the game from The Chronicles of Riddick. They sought to explore Riddick's character in a prison break setting, and took inspiration from films such as Escape from Alcatraz. Starbreeze was also inspired by video games such as GoldenEye 007 and the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. The opening sequence, in which Riddick is escorted into Butcher Bay, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to Half-Life, and the game's hand-to-hand combat was inspired by Punch-Out!!. Starbreeze focused solely on developing the game's single-player mode, and did not include multiplayer; the company believed that such a mode would require a design team twice as large and another year of development.|$|E

5|$|The episode <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to {{the silent}} films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes {{of it are}} entirely dialogue-free. Several types of music are used to express what is not being said; music acts as the narrator. During Giles' {{overhead}} presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. Buffy and Riley's love theme is presented {{for the first time}} when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for Buffy regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the Buffy and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, but a bit more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between Buffy and Riley would go.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tribute</b> to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E
