40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the characteristics of}} managed pressure drilling (MPD) technology and impact of wellhead back pressure on the wellbore annulus pressure profile, {{and found that the}} application of this technology provides situation for improvement in the current casing program design. Meanwhile, the equivalent density of drilling fluid in wellbore annulus needs to consider the impact of back pressure. On this basis, casing program design for top-down design approach and multi-pressure system formation in MPD are established. Comparing and analyzing the results of casing program design in MPD and conventional drilling, it can be concluded that for the top-down design method, each layer of casing can reach to a deeper depth. It can also reduce the casing level for the multi-pressure system formation using wellhead back pressure to make the wellbore annulus pressure profiles bend. Thus, it can cleverly pass through the complex formation which needs multi-layer <b>intermediate</b> <b>casings</b> in conventional drilling.

40|$|AbstractThe risk of leakage along {{existing}} wellbores {{associated with}} CO 2 sequestration depends strongly upon the leakage path permeabilities. If enough buildups of surface casing pressure (SCP) {{and rates of}} surface casing vent flow (SCVF) recorded on <b>intermediate</b> wellbore <b>casing</b> strings are available, a frequency distribution of leakage path permeability values can be obtained. Uncertainty about {{the location of the}} leak source results in a range of leakage path permeability values for each measurement of SCP or SCVF. Most permeability values exceed intact cement permeability, consistent with the presence of cracks or other defects in the formation/cement/casing interface. Assuming the gas migration path through leaky wellbores in hydrocarbon reservoirs is analogous to the leakage path for CO 2 plumes, the distribution of inferred permeabilities enables quantitative estimation of CO 2 leakage fluxes...|$|R
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} a helicopter, which met with a Cat-I accident on November 27, 2008, were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that all the four bolts connecting the tail drive shaft (TDS) with the main gearbox (MGB) have sheared off. Fractographic study confirmed that these bolts have failed by fatigue. Examination also discovered {{that three of the}} four bolts used were not as per the design specification. It was found that these bolts were longer than that of the recommended one, and they are actually meant for use with the <b>intermediate</b> gearbox (IGB) <b>casing.</b> There was mix-up of bolts and the wrong ones were used in this particular case. The shank length of the IGB bolts is such that it does not provide enough threads to allow tightening of the assembly joint at the TDS connecting flange. Since the bolts cannot travel beyond the first thread from the shank, the reading on the torque wrench during this assembly would have been a wrong indication of tightness of the joint. In fact, the joint was either loose or did not have required pretension. Because of this, there was slip between the TDS connecting flange and the main rotor brake disc. This had resulted in excessive load on the fourth bolt which appears to have failed first by fatigue. Following this, the unequal load distribution in conjunction with the looseness in the joint was responsible for the fatigue failure of the remaining three bolts. Hence, the primary failure in the system was the failure of the bolts at the TDS connecting flange – main rotor brake disc assembly. The other damages seen on other components/structures of the helicopter are secondary in nature and would have occurred subsequent to the primary failure or during crash onto the ground. It is, therefore, stated that the mix-up of the bolts during assembly of the TDS was responsible for the failure and the accident...|$|R

30|$|Intermediate casings in the build {{sections}} {{are subject}} to severe wear in extended-reach drilling. This paper presents a new method for predicting the depth of a wear groove on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing.</b> According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation of casing wear by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the wear groove depth and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} casing wear groove is crescent-shaped. The change of casing wear groove depth versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting casing wear location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The casing wear groove depth of a planned well is predicted with inversion of the casing wear factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting casing wear in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on casing wear should be taken into account in casing wear prediction.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{a casing}} design model is {{introduced}} to design casing strings for a gas {{well in the}} longwall mining area for production from the Marcellus shale. The stress/strain data are obtained using numerical modeling of ground. The data used in the completion design are obtained by using a query function, which lists the calculated parameters along a vertical line representing the gas well. The stress/strain data obtained from modeling {{are used in the}} background spreadsheet for casing design and are not accessible by users. Also, the horizontal displacement observed from the FEA model needs to be considered in the casing design modeling. For mining geometries other than the one set forth, background stress and strain data need {{to be added to the}} spreadsheet prior to undertaking casing design. There are five types of casing to be used in gas well completion in the longwall mining areas. This system was included in the base casing/completion design model. The casings include: drive pipe, aquifer casing, coal protection casing, <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing,</b> and production casing. The model is built into a spreadsheet and allows an interactive design by changing the input parameters and shows the resulting casing and well completion design parameters. Figure  7 displays the interface of inputs in this model. In the case considered in this study, the coal seam depth is fixed to 200  m (660 – 670 ft). The depth of groundwater can be varied to between 60 and 120  m (200 – 400 ft). Through the input interface in this model, users are also allowed to input safety factors, which are used to quantify the minimum strength of all casings. Then by selecting the “read safety factors” and corresponding buttons, the user can see the results for various casing sizes. Users are able to click the “start over” button to erase all input data and calculated results, and retype other groups of data as needed. For the selection of casing, four tables of casings with various minimum performance properties were put at the right side of the buttons with the name of casings. After the initial setting and data entry, the model automatically selects proper casing size and grade for the aquifer casing, coal protection casing, <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing,</b> and drive pipe. Then, the numbers of available casings will appear in the “Results” column on the left side of the input data for manual selection of feasible casings for the given geometric and ground conditions. As noted before, if the geometry of the longwall panels, including the depth, width of the panel and size of the pillars change, numerical modeling has to be performed to revise the background data on stresses and strain that should be used in the wellbore completion design program.|$|E

Parameters considered in the theoretical method include operating load during drilling and completion and the temperature field, pressure field and the end effect of pressure during gas production. The finite element method for multistring analysis is developed to simulate random contact between casings. The relevant finite element analysis scheme is also presented according to the actual procedures of drilling, completion and gas production. Finally, field cases are presented and analyzed using the proposed methods. These are four offshore wells in the South China Sea. The calculated wellhead growths during gas production are compared with measured values. The {{results show that the}} wellhead subsides during drilling and completion and grows up during gas production. The theoretical and finite element solutions for wellhead growth are in good agreement with measured values and the deviations of calculation are within 10 %. The maximum von Mises stress on the uncemented <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing</b> occurs during the running of the oil tube. The maximum von Mises stress on the uncemented production casing, calculated with the theoretical method occurs at removing the blow-out-preventer (BOP) while that calculated with the finite element method occurs at gas production. Finite element solutions for von Mises stress are recommended and the uncemented casings of four wells satisfy strength requirements.|$|E

Four wells (GT- 2, EE- 1, EE- 2, and EE- 3) penetrated 733 m (2405 ft) of Cenozoic and Paleozoic sediments and Precambrian crystalline rock units to + 4572 m (+ 15, 000 ft). The Cenozoic rocks consist of volcanics (rhyolite, tuff, and pumice) and volcaniclastic sediments. Paleozoic strata include Permian red beds (Abo formation) and the Pennsylvanian Madera and Sandia Formations, which consist of massive limestones and shales. Beneath the Sandia Formation are igneous and metamorphic rocks of Precambrian age. The drilling fluid used for the upper sedimentary formations was a polymeric flocculated bentonite drilling fluid. Severe loss of circulation occurred in the cavernous portions of the Sandia limestones.

30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing</b> which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from casing shoe to top of casing string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|E

Then, a multiphase flow finite element model was established for the fluid-cutting particle system in this drilling condition. This technology was tested in field. Double-casing tubes cementing is adopted in this technology and a jet generator is installed {{at the bottom of}} the inner casing.

40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry uses {{a variety of}} qualitative risk assessment methods for maintaining well integrity, such as well barrier schematics and barrier diagrams. Identifying barriers and using well barrier schematics are helpful tools in qualitative risk assessments. However, {{it is not yet}} clear if these methods can be applied for risk assessments in the geothermal industry. Geothermal wells often produce directly through the casing, instead of through production tubing, making it difficult to identify two independent barrier envelopes in accordance to NORSOK D- 010. High temperatures and corrosion are the most common contributors to failure in geothermal wells. In this study, a hypothetical case of a downhole corrosion problem was assessed by means of conducting a qualitative risk analysis and identifying well barriers in a geothermal well.

40|$|The Yowlumne {{field is}} a giant field in the {{southern}} San Joaquin basin, Kern County, California. It is a deep (13, 000 ft) waterflood operation that produces from the Miocene- aged Stevens Sand. The reservoir is interpreted as a layered, fan-shaped, prograding turbidite complex containing several lobe-shaped sand bodies that represent distinct flow units. A high ultimate recovery factor is expected, yet significant quantities of undrained oil remain at the fan margins. The fan margins are not economic to develop using vertical wells because of thinning pay, deteriorating rock quality, and depth. This project attempts to demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting the northeast distal fan margin {{through the use of}} a high- angle well completed with multiple hydraulic- fracture treatments. A high-angle well offers greater pay exposure than can be achieved with a vertical well. Hydraulic-fracture treatments will establish vertical communication between thin interbedded layers and the wellbore. The equivalent production rate and reserves of three vertical wells are anticipated at a cost of approximately two vertical wells. The near-horizontal well penetrated the Yowlumne sand; a Stevens sand equivalent, in the distal fan margin in the northeast area of the field. The well was drilled in a predominately westerly direction towards the interior of the field, in the direction of improving rock quality. Drilling and completion operations proved to be very challenging, leading to a number of adjustments to original plans. Hole conditions resulted in obtaining less core material than desired and setting <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing</b> 1200 ft too high. The 7 in. production liner stuck 1000 ft off bottom, requiring a 5 in. liner to be run the rest of the way. The cement job on the 5 in. liner resulted in a very poor bond, which precluded one of three hydraulic fracture treatments originally planned for the well. Openhole logs confirmed most expectations going into the project about basic rock properties: the formation was shaly with low porosities, and water saturations were in line with expectations, including the presence of some intervals swept out by the waterflood. High water saturations at the bottom of the well eliminated one of the originally planned hydraulic fracture treatments. Although porosities proved to be low, they were more uniform across the formation than expected. Permeabilities of the various intervals continue to be evaluated, but appear to be better than expected from the porosity log model derived in Budget Period One. The well was perforated in all pay sections behind the 5 in. liner.

40|$|The {{top hole}} section in an {{offshore}} well is conventionally drilled riserless utilizing seawater with high viscosity sweeps for cuttings removal. In recent years, {{the possibility of}} eliminating the pilot hole and setting the surface casing below shallow gas or shallow water flow zones has been investigated. This would allow for setting the surface casing below potential problem zones, {{so that they do}} not cause problems deeper in the well. Furthermore this could provide sufficient formation strength at the casing shoe, which can open for reducing the number of subsequent casing strings. In order to safely penetrate a shallow gas zone without drilling a pilot hole with dynamic kill possibilities, weighted mud must be utilized when using a conventional top hole drilling system. Owing to {{the fact that this is}} done riserless, which results in huge mud losses to seabed, alternative methods should be considered to avoid the "pump and dump" strategy. Drilling the top hole section whilst circulating the drilling fluid back to the rig can be achieved by utilizing the riserless mud recovery (RMR) system or the low riser return system (LRRS). These new "dual-gradient" systems have a significant benefit in terms of avoiding "pump and dump" when drilling the top hole section. Well barrier designs have been proposed which incorporate techniques and solutions to handling shallow gas with regards to barrier requirements, including procedures for handling the problem of gas trapped between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>casing</b> and surface casing (trapped annuli). The LRRS system is primarily intended for dual-gradient drilling with a BOP, but can be modified for use in top hole drilling. However, seeing that this system involves utilizing a riser, this system will not be approved for top hole drilling on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Based on my studies of different techniques of tackling shallow gas in the top hole section, it is found that the RMR system is favorable for eliminating the pilot hole and setting the surface casing below a shallow gas or shallow water flow zone in a safe and time-efficient manner. The riserless return system enables return of fluid and cuttings in a closed system. Since weighted mud is used the risk of shallow gas influx is reduced compared to conventional riserless drilling. Owing to the fact that the return is routed to the platform, shallow gas is a cause of concern. The existing regulations for drilling on the NCS do not allow for elimination of the pilot hole when shallow gas is expected. However, simulations have shown that the system can detect an influx prior to gas reaching the return line, and also handle the influx in a safe manner. This verifies the feasibility of the RMR system related to safety and well control. </p...|$|E
