An {{independent}} counsel determined Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|E

The {{book has}} been described by Politico as a [...] "sensational" [...] work that contains [...] "explosive, but highly dubious, revelations about both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton" [...] with a focus on Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations. Morrow calls himself [...] "a truth seeker and a truth teller. Even if it's the ugly truth."

In 2016, she spoke out, together with Clinton's two other accusers (Paula Jones and <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey),</b> in favor of Donald Trump's campaign.

50|$|As a publisher, Jackson {{has been}} known to embrace {{controversial}} books and tactics. A bestselling children's book published by World Ahead, Help! Mom! There are Liberals Under my Bed penned by Katharine Debrecht, portrayed Hillary Clinton as a cartoon villain, prompting a verbal clash with Clinton's spokesman. He once accused Google of political bias for censoring online ads for a book critical of Bill Clinton, a charge Google denied, and he later paid to send <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey</b> and Juanita Broaddrick to the Bill Clinton Presidential Library along with the book's author. In October 2006, Jackson and Joseph Farah, the founder of WorldNetDaily, announced that World Ahead Publishing would be partnering on the influential WND Books imprint.|$|E
50|$|In January 1998, Tripp {{gave the}} surreptitiously {{recorded}} tapes to then-Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{in exchange for}} immunity from prosecution. Tripp disclosed to Starr that {{she was aware of}} the relationship between Lewinsky and President Clinton, that Lewinsky had executed a false affidavit denying the relationship that was submitted to the federal court in Arkansas in the Jones v. Clinton lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to suborn Tripp's perjury in the Jones v. Clinton suit to conceal the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship as well as Tripp's claim regarding <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey</b> from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.|$|E

5000|$|On October 8, 2016, in {{the wake}} of the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, Trump retweeted Broaddrick's tweets about in which she calls Bill Clinton a [...] "rapist" [...] and calls Hillary Clinton's actions [...] "horrific". [...] On October 9 Broaddrick {{appeared}} in a panel appearance with Trump and Paula Jones and <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey</b> (a fourth woman at the panel, Kathy Shelton, had an unrelated grievance against Hillary Clinton) an hour before the second debate between Trump and Clinton in the general election portion of the United States presidential election debates, 2016. Broaddrick and the others were also in the audience during the debate, as was Bill Clinton, although debate organizers kept them in separate areas. The Trump campaign said it had paid for Broaddrick's travel to the debate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{release of}} the tape led to a renewed {{anticipation}} towards the October 9 debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, {{as it would be}} the first time for each candidate to directly address the controversy. Less than two hours before the debate began, Trump held a surprise press conference in St. Louis with Paula Jones, <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey,</b> and Juanita Broaddrick, who have previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, and Kathy Shelton, a rape victim whose rapist had been represented in the 1970s by Hillary, an appointed public defender. Describing the conference as his [...] "debate prep", Trump described the women as [...] "courageous" [...] and [...] "victims of the Clintons", with each of the women repeating their grievances with the Clintons. At the conference, Trump refused to answer journalists' questions about the Access Hollywood tape. Clinton's campaign dismissed the conference as [...] "an act of desperation" [...] and denounced Trump's [...] "destructive race to the bottom." [...] First Lady Michelle Obama said referring to the controversy, [...] "It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Final Report of the U.S. Office of the Independent Counsel report {{noted that}} [...] "Willey and President Clinton {{are the only}} direct {{witnesses}} to their meeting, and their accounts differ substantially on the crucial facts of what occurred." [...] It also stated [...] "Willey gave false information to the FBI about her sexual relationship with a former boyfriend, and acknowledged having lied about it when the agents confronted her with contradictory evidence. There were also some differences in her Paula Jones and Grand Jury testimony. Although, in both her Grand Jury and Paula Jones testimony she stated she had been harassed. [...] Following Willey's acknowledgment of these lies about her boyfriend, [...] "the Independent Counsel agreed not to prosecute Willey for any offense arising out of the investigation, including false statements in her Jones deposition, so long as she cooperated fully and truthfully with the investigation." [...] According to Independent Counsel Robert Ray's report, [...] "Willey's Paula Jones deposition testimony differed from her grand jury testimony on material aspects of the alleged incident." [...] In short, there was insufficient evidence to prove to a jury {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that President Clinton's testimony regarding <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey</b> was false. Accordingly, the Independent Counsel declined prosecution.|$|E
40|$|The serious {{working women}} I talk to agree. <b>Kathleen</b> <b>Willey</b> {{is the last}} straw. We're mad as hell, {{and no one is}} saying what we are saying to each other. We are outraged and enraged by the entire cast of {{characters}} in the White House scandal, from the apologists to the pundits, but especially all of the supposed president's women headlined in the Clinton sex scandal, those claiming sexual harassment and those consenting adults who invited sexual engagement and then exploited it...|$|E
