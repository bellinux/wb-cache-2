5|$|A <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the myth's end {{focuses on}} Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not {{reconciled}} with his rival, but utterly defeated, {{and sometimes he}} is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the {{referendum}} was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

25|$|<b>Different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Atonement—Protestant Christianity has {{traditionally}} taught that Jesus Christ performed his work of atonement on the Cross, {{and that his}} sacrificial death brought to fulfillment the entire Old Testament sacrificial system, including the Day of Atonement. The idea that the Day of Atonement does not meet its antitype until 18 centuries after Jesus' crucifixion is a deviation from historic Christian theology.|$|E

25|$|Although Nyan Win officially apologized, an October 13 article locally {{published}} in the government-owned Mirror newspaper offered a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the events. It claimed that Nagai had entered the country using a tourist visa instead of proper journalist visa and faulted the cameraman for failing to get a permit to cover the news inside Myanmar. It emphasized that the event occurred {{at the time of}} martial law being imposed and the soldiers could not differentiate between a Burmese citizen and a Japanese because of the resemblance in Asian looks.|$|E
25|$|The {{commitment}} made selecting one {{or another}} ontology can produce a sharply <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the task at hand. Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E
25|$|The seven optical telescopes at Bayfordbury campus allow {{students}} to observe detailed images of objects in space. They can be equipped {{with a variety of}} research-grade CCD cameras, high resolution spectrographs or high frame-rate video cameras. Moreover, the five newest telescopes are also able to be operated remotely, and students and staff can request observations via the internet and have images taken automatically when the weather allows. The 4.5-metre radio telescope and 3-dish 115-metre baseline interferometer allow a completely <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the universe. These are connected to 21cm line receivers, to detect the neutral hydrogen in the galaxy and extragalactic radio sources.|$|E

While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, {{the creators of}} the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they can get the same stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than they do on their print editions.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra telling us of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’. We then come to “The Beginning”, {{which consists of}} a third-person narration focused first on Astrid, then Magnus, then Michael, then finally Eve. Through each character we obtain a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> how Amber came into their lives, and who they believed her to be, when she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank {{which resulted in the}} suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E

500|$|The aliens take a keen {{interest}} examining the human response to this crisis, and compare notes to previous reactions by Klingons and Cardassians. They are members of an advanced species looking to make [...] "first contact". So far, based on 10,000 years of observations, no species has been deemed ready. Seeking a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the crew, they temporarily shift to the bodies of Phlox, T'Pol, and Archer. A difference in opinion between the two aliens starts to form: one seems determined to maintain their non-interference protocol, while the other feels the protocol is outdated and unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins {{expressed}} a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin with her book In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction. Tompkins praised the style {{so many other}} critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions {{had the power to}} change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, were remarkable for their [...] "intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness"; and that Uncle Tom's Cabin offers a [...] "critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, however, {{critics are}} {{reacting}} more positively to Tchaikovsky's tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship. [...] "Tchaikovsky is being viewed {{again as a}} composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence," [...] according to cultural historian and author Joseph Horowitz. Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century. [...] "We have acquired a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Romantic 'excess,'" [...] Horowitz says. [...] "Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all." ...|$|E

Shot in thirteen days, {{the film was}} released on September 2011. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the character-driven film and the portrayal of its lead alongside the city compared to most Hindi films: [...] " [...] a film like this provides a radically <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> India than you can find in the pleasures and excesses of Bollywood".|$|E
500|$|As the {{negotiations}} were taking place, Gordon Brown returned to Downing Street {{and held a}} meeting with Nick Clegg at the Foreign Office for talks. A Downing Street spokesman later confirmed the talks, together with the previous evening's telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, which was described as [...] "an amicable discussion." [...] However, Paddy Ashdown – a previous Liberal Democrat leader – offered a <b>different</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Brown-Clegg conference call, telling the BBC it [...] "was a diatribe, a rant, and that Gordon Brown was threatening in his approach to Nick Clegg." [...] Following {{the success of the}} talks between their two parties, Clegg and Cameron held a second round of face-to-face discussions at Westminster that evening, lasting 45 minutes.|$|E
