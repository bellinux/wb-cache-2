5|$|It is {{difficult}} to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the events of this war contributed {{to changes in the}} use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided {{with the end of the}} period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
25|$|The Fragility of Goodness {{confronts the}} ethical dilemma that {{individuals}} strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external {{factors that may}} deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability {{as a key to}} realizing the human good.|$|E
25|$|Each {{state may}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> {{the use of}} a jury is used. The use of a jury is {{optional}} for civil trials in any Australian state. The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. Sometimes a state law may allow an accused person to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} deformity of {{the joint}} may get worse over time, or may remain static. A dog may have good X-rays and yet be in pain, or may have very poor X-rays and have no apparent pain issues. The hip condition is only one factor to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> dysplasia is causing pain or affecting the quality of life. In mild to moderate dysplasia it is often the secondary effects of abnormal wear and tear or arthritis, rather than dysplasia itself, which is the direct causes of visible problems.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors may}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> {{circular}} migration is impactful upon {{the return of}} the migrant. First, the size of the returning population is important, as large numbers of migrants may form a critical mass necessary for true change to occur. Second, the duration of the absence of the migrants is influential, as too short of an absence brings little change and too long of an absence leads to difficulties in readjustment. Third, {{it is important to consider}} social class, as the elite may have a greater impact than unskilled workers. Fourth, the extent to which the origin and destination areas are different can have an effect, as those who migrate to metropolitan areas will have a greater impact if returning to an urban rather than a rural area. Lastly, the quantity and quality of the skills that the migrant acquires while abroad can determine the impact of migration.|$|E
25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge {{will be the most}} likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{analysis}} from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, {{up to and}} including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> her language had regressed.|$|E
500|$|Because {{communication}} in ancient society was predominantly oral, {{it can be}} difficult to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For Punic, Coptic, and Aramaic or Syriac, a significant amount of epigraphy or literature survives. The Celtic languages were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the orality of Celtic education left scant written records, Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare. The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of Gothic. Multilingualism contributed to the [...] "cultural triangulation" [...] by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of Romanization and Hellenization.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{considered}} their sample of homosexual adults more representative than {{those used in}} previous studies, and argued {{that the fact that}} they examined blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was [...] "relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different theoretical perspective. They argued that their varying outlooks counteracted any bias due to their respective backgrounds. Bell et al. did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, Bell et al. did not report results that could be explained through exposure to books, articles or scientific lectures about homosexuality. They used path analysis, a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. Path analysis required dividing [...] "the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur." [...] The dependent variable Bell et al. wanted to explain, adult sexual preference, went at the final stage.|$|E

500|$|When {{describing}} the public reaction to Frank, historians mention {{the class and}} ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging {{the complexity of the}} case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian John Higham writes that [...] "economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law.... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth." [...] Historian Nancy MacLean writes that some historians have argued that this was an American Dreyfus affair, which she said [...] " [...] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker." [...] Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself [...] "in a position of much latent tension and symbolism." [...] Stating {{that it is impossible to}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that [...] " [...] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women." ...|$|E

Ridley exemplified that having ‘athletic’ genes makes one want to practice a sport, and having ‘intellectual’ genes makes one seek out intellectual activities. [...] "The genes are {{the agents of}} nurture {{and are more likely}} to be affecting appetite more than aptitude". Genes do not make the individual intelligent, the make them more likely to enjoy learning. [...] They encourage individuals to seek out environmental influences that will satisfy their appetites.

2500|$|Finally, since a beam {{of light}} can be {{composed}} of many different wavelengths, to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> a physical color C in Hcolor stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to w), over the interval , of C(w)·s(w), of C(w)·m(w), and of C(w)·l(w). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color C (which is an element in Hcolor) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in R3color). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the [...] "physical" [...] space Hcolor can all result in the same single perceived color in R3color, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.|$|E
