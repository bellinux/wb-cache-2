40|$|The black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> (Figure 1) is a shiny, {{black fly}} similar {{in size and}} {{appearance}} to the house fly. It is currently regaining popularity as a biological control agent for controlling house flies on poultry farms {{without the use of}} pesticides. The fly is native to the U. S., and Central and South America. The current scientific name of the fly is Hydrotaea aenescens, however it is sometimes referred to by its former name, Ophyra aenescens. The purpose of this document is to provide some general information about this fly, its biology and behavior, and how it is being used to control house flies in animal manures. Biology Although the black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> is referred to as a biological control agent for house flies, it is the larvae (or maggots) that are actually the predators. Black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae will kill the larvae of many (but not all) other fly species. When fly larvae that are suitable <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> prey are in a substrate with <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae, it is generally only the <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae that survive to become adults. But black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae do not need to feed on other fly larvae to develop normally; they can develop using only the nutrients in the substrate. For this reason they are called facultative predators. Black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae have the ability to kill up to 20 house fly larvae daily during much of their developmental period. This is a rare example of animals killing more prey than they can eat. When black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae and house fly larvae are together in the same substrate, the <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae will pursue and kill the house fly larvae. When a house fly larva is killed, nearby house fly larvae are attracted. This activity makes it easier for <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> larvae to eliminate their victims. The black <b>dump</b> <b>fly</b> has a life cycle {{similar to that of the}} house fly. Females lay an average of 170 eggs over a period of 7 to 10 days. Under optimum conditions (80 ° F or 26. 7 °C, and 60 % RH), eggs hatch in 18 to 24 hours. There are three larval or maggot stages, followed by the pupal stage where the larva changes to the adult fly. Adults emerge from their pupal case, and mate after about 5 days. About 2 days later, females begin laying their eggs. Time required from egg to adult is approximately 14 days. This cycle may be shorter at warmer temperatures, and longer at cooler temperatures...|$|R

The strategy must include: adequate treatments by incorporating fertilizer and amendments, as composts and modified indigenous volcanic tuff; selecting plant species and agricultural work in accordance with geographical and weather conditions. Our in situ experiment on a lignite <b>fly</b> ash <b>dump</b> was performed in the fall during the seeding period of Festuca arundinacea and Onobrychis viciifolia species to provide the water requirement of plants, and consequently a quick and efficient development of plants, enabling them to resist later in the hot and drought days of summer.

The other plant species did not tolerate the unfertilized fly ash. The fertilizer and modified indigenous volcanic tuff provided establishing conditions for the plant supplying the nutrients. Metal transfer to aerial tissues was reduced compared to control by 29. 5 - 59. 3 % in the case of Cu, Cr, Ni and ranged 50 - 66 % for Pb.

In order to test existing protocols for heavy metals, several intercomparisons were organised within the framework of an EU-INCO project "ANALEACH", in which seven institutes from five countries participated. Two existing reference materials were made available for the project and test batches of two new fly ash reference materials were produced.

Vegetation development at ash dumps is an ecological solution to minimize the environmental threats of ash; however, low content of nutrients, organic matter and moisture pose a challenge for plant growth at the dumps. Bacterial indole acetic acid (IAA) facilitates plant recruitment and growth, more crucially in degraded ecosystems. Bacteria with different levels of IAA determine the plant-bacterial interactions as pathogenesis or symbiosis, therefore, form microbial functional types. Understanding plant-soil feedback and identifying environmental predictors of bacterial IAA producers at ash dump would help in improving biostimulation strategies for vegetation development. Therefore, to evolve a nature-based solution for vegetational restoration of ash dumps, we analyzed the role of geochemical factors, host species and age of dump on the assembly of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of naturally colonizing grasses (Saccharum ravennae and Cynodon dactylon). Analyses showed that the rhizosphere effect on geochemical traits was distinct in the dumps, irrespective of the host plant and age of the dumps. The rhizobacterial communities from the dumps produce relatively high mean IAA levels and harbor a high micro-diversity of IAA producers {{as compared with the}} region as a whole (non-rhizosphere or bulk ash). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the host species and specific nutrients, i. e., NO 3 -N, PO 4 -P, Fe, and Na are the significant predictors of bacterial IAA functional types.

The identification of environmental predictors of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of S. ravennae and C. dactylon has provided basic guidelines to improve the biostimulation strategies to accelerate vegetation restoration at the ash dumps.

Air pollution is one part of it, as toxic gases get free when coal is burned and the dust of the coal that is stored around the plants accesses the lungs while breathing. Data of the Central Pollution Control Board proves that the air in Ennore is unhealthy to breathe. [...] A huge threat to the environment in Ennore is the illegal <b>dumping</b> of <b>fly</b> ash by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO), which is running the North Chennai Thermal Power Plant. Fly ash from the ash pond of the plant in leaking into the Ennore Creek. The Ennore Creek that plays {{a vital role in}} balancing the coastal ecosystem in the area. Fly ash is a by-product when coal gets burned and is toxic; it contains heavy metals such as arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, mercury and selenium. [...] Heavy metals such as selenium bioaccumulate in fish and harm their ability to reproduce. This affects fish resources and in turn, livelihood of fishermen. In some areas the dumped ash has reduced the depth of the creek from 14 feet below sea level to 2 to 4 feet. This reduces the creek´s ability to carry water, which is crucial, especially in times of flooding and in some areas makes it nearly impossible for fishermen to use their boats on the water. In an recent order the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal forces TANGEDCO to remove the illegally <b>dumped</b> <b>fly</b> ash from the Ennore Creek. If TANGEDCO fails to do this within one week the two units from it will be shut down at the next hearing. Additionaly TANGEDCO has to repair leaking pipes {{and come up with a}} plan how to replace the old ones.|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScFly ash is {{the major}} waste {{material}} produced by power plants in the combustion of coal to generate electricity. The main constituents of fly ash are Si, Al, Fe and Ca with smaller amount of S, Mn, Na, K, and traces of many other elements such as Co, Cd, As, Se, Zn, Mo, Pb, B, Cu and Ni. Fly ash is usually disposed either by dry or wet disposal methods. These disposal methods have raised major environmental concerns due to the potential leaching of chemical species from the ash heap by ingress of rainfall and brine used to transport the fly ash to the dam. This study focuses on the changes in chemical composition, morphology and mineral phases due to weathering, of coal fly ash co-disposed with brine over 20 years at Sasol Secunda ash dump in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The design and operation of the Secunda ash dump presupposes that the ash dump may act as a sink for the salts which originated from chemicals used for normal operation in the plants. The majority of these salts come from the brines generated during desalination and raw water regeneration. The {{aim of this study}} is to ascertain if the ash dump could serve as a sustainable salt sink. Samples were drawn along the depth of two drilled cores (S 1 and S 3) from the weathered Secunda ash dump and analysed in conjunction with the fresh (unweathered) Secunda fly ash taken from the fly ash hoppers for comparative analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractive (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry were employed to obtain a detailed morphological, mineralogical and bulk chemical composition of all the samples. Pore water analysis was used to determine the pH, EC and moisture content of fly ash samples. A five step sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to establish the geochemical association of particular elements with various mineral phases. The total acid digestion test was also used to determine the total elemental compositions of the Secunda fly ash samples. The SEM results showed that the fly ashes consist of irregular and numerous spherically shaped particles. Changes (encrustations, etchings and corrosion) in the morphologies of the weathered ash particles were also observed. The XRD results revealed quartz, mullite, lime and calcite as the major mineral phases. Other minerals identified in very minor quantities in the drilled Secunda ash core that were dried prior to analysis were halite, kaolinite, nitratine, bassanite, microline. and hydrophitte. These phases may have formed during sample handling. XRF investigation revealed that the major oxides present in the dumped ash samples were SiO₂, A₂ 2 O₃, CaO, Fe₂O₃, MgO, Na₂O, TiO₂ and the minor elements present were K₂O, P₂O₅, SO₃ and MnO. The sum of the mean values of the % composition of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and Fe₂O₃ was 70. 19 %, and 72. 94 % for the two drilled ash core samples (S 1 and S 3) respectively, and 78. 67 % for the fresh ash which shows the significant alteration of the Si, Al and Fe content in the ash matrix over time. The fly ash is classified as Class F using the ASTM C 618 standards. The loss on ignition (LOI) which is an indication of unburned carbon or organic content was 4. 78 %, 13. 45 % and 8. 32 % for the fresh ash, drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. The high LOI values for the drilled ash cores could indicate high hydrocarbon content in the ash dump because of co-disposal practises where hydrocarbon waste are included in the brine stream for disposal on the ash. While the ash samples from the surface appeared dry, moisture content (MC) analysis showed that there is considerable water entrained in the <b>fly</b> ash <b>dump.</b> The fresh ash MC was 1. 8 % while core S 1 ranged from 41. 4 – 73. 2 %; core S 3 ranged from 21. 7 – 76. 4 %. The variations in the MC values can be attributed to uneven flow paths due to inconsistent placement conditions or variations in ambient weather conditions during placement. The fresh fly ash (n= 3) had a pH of 12. 38 ± 0. 15, EC value of 4. 98 ± 0. 03 mS/cm and TDS value of 2. 68 ± 0. 03 g/L, the pH of the drilled ash core S 1 (n= 35) was 10. 04 ± 0. 50, the EC value was 1. 08 ± 0. 14 mS/cm and the TDS value was 0. 64 ± 0. 08 g/L. Core S 3 (n= 66) had pH of 11. 04 ± 0. 09; EC was 0. 99 ± 0. 03 and TDS was 0. 57 ± 0. 01. The changes in pH values can be attributed to the dissolution and flushing out from the dump basic alkaline oxides like CaO and MgO These variations in pH values shows that the fly ash is acidifying over time and metal mobility can be expected under these conditions. The large decrease of EC in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 compared to the fresh ash indicated a major loss of ionic species over time in the ash dump. The sequential extraction scheme revealed that the elements Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Mn, Na, K, As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn are present in Secunda fresh and weathered fly ash and are partitioned between the water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, iron and manganese, and residual fractions of the coal fly ash. It also showed that the trace elements As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn do not show permanent association with particular mineral phases as a continuous partitioning between different mineral phases was observed in the weathered drilled core. Generally, all the elements had the highest concentration in the residual fraction. But it was evident that the labile phase (water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions) had fairly high concentrations of Si (± 6. 5 %), Al (± 6. 5 %), Ca (± 10 %), Mg (± 5. 5 %), Ba (± 7. 5 %),Sr (± 7. 5 %), Na (± 12 %) and K (± 12 %) for the Secunda drilled ash core (S 1 and S 3) and fresh fly ash samples. This indicates that these species can leach easily upon water ingress and could pose a danger to the environment. Na and K had the highest concentrations leached out in the labile phase in all the ash samples. The amount of Na leached out of the drilled Secunda ash core in the labile phase was 13. 21 % of 18584. 26 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 1; and 9. 59 % of 11600. 17 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 3 while the fresh Secunda fly ash leached out 11. 28 % of 16306. 30 mg/kg of Na in the five geochemical phases. This study provided significant insight into the pore water chemistry, morphology, mineralogy and chemical composition and the elemental distribution pattern of the major and trace elements in the Secunda fly ash and weathered drilled Secunda ashm core S 1 and S 3. Though results from XRF analysis and the sequential extraction scheme shows that Na, K, S, Ca and Mg were slightly captured from the co-disposed brine by the Secunda fly ash, these species were however released in the labile phase. Hence there was no significant retention of these species in the ash dump. The amount of these species retained in the weathered ash were (0. 26 % and 0. 55 %) for Na, (0. 02 % and 0. 34 %) for K, (0. 08 % and 0. 06 %) for S, (0. 94 % and 0. 01 %) for Ca and (0. 37 % and 0. 96 %) for Mg in drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. This poor retention of Na K, S, Ca and Mg which are major components of Sasol Secunda brine in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 clearly shows the unsustainability of the Secunda <b>fly</b> ash <b>dump</b> as a salt sink...|$|R
