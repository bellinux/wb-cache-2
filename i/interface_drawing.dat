Sociograms, depicting social relations as nodes and lines, have played an important part in the reification of social structures since the beginnings of sociometry. This paper brings together two strands of analysis: first, a historical perspective on the development of social network visualization; and, second, exemplary stories of black-boxed technologies that inform not only the depiction, but also the interpretation of social networks.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, fire {{governance}} {{practices in the}} British Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) have undergone fundamental transformation. Rather than just being responded to as and when they occur, the FRS have adopted a range of anticipatory governing strategies to govern fires in anticipation of their occurence. This turn towards anticipatory governance has been facilitated {{in no small part}} by the digital infrastructure now embedded in the FRS. Composed of data, hardware, software, fibre-optic cables along with human analysts and organisational processes, this infrastructure operates to make risk projections on fire which shape and condition strategic decision making. This paper explores the operation of this digital infrastructure through the notion of <b>interface.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on empirical material relating to processes of data sourcing and risk calculation, interfaces account for the sites, moments and experiences in which human and non-human agents relate to one another in making fire risk projections.

40|$|This article reviews {{our present}} {{understanding}} of the metal-solution <b>interface,</b> <b>drawing</b> comparisons {{between it and the}} metal-gas interface. The chief difference between these two systems is the solvent, which has a profound effect on the physics and chemistry of the interface. The solvent is never entirely inert, and if polar, as water is, will adsorb on the metal surface and stabilize ions in solution. However, the presence of ions in solution allows a current to be passed between two electrodes inserted in the solution, and one of these electrodes can be the metal under investigation. This is the field of electrochemistry, and much of our knowledge of the metal-solution interface is derived from electrochemical measurements. Complementary information is gained from many of the techniques used to study the metal-gas interface. The first type of electrochemical system to be considered is one in which the application of a potential across the interface does not lead to charge transfer. Such a system behaves as a capacitance due to the formation of a complex double layer. The effects of various types of adsorption is then described. The deposition of metals on the electrode surface is next considered, and this is followed by a discussion of the reverse metal dissolution reaction. The final section concerns the formation of films on the metal surface, a reaction which has its parallel in metal-gas reactions...|$|E

The analysis is based primarily on the authors' own experiences and has been developed through a deliberate process of reflection. It suggests, first, that it is important to acknowledge the conceptual and symbolic uses and impacts of research - perhaps, particularly in relation to the system-oriented work of HPSR groups. These uses may not be verifiable by specific changes in policy and practice but are important contributions to the policy environment and do filter into policy-makers' understandings and actions. Second, achieving any form of impact on policy is linked to the attention researchers pay to the context in which the research is undertaken, the nature and credibility of the research; and the importance of nesting any single project in a broader programme of engagement with the policy environment that builds trust in the researchers.

40|$|Ball Aerospace and Redstone Engineering {{together}} have designed, built, and {{are currently}} assembling a hybrid cryocooler tailored for cooling infrared imaging {{systems that have}} variable loads. The system is a hybrid of complementary Stirling and Joule-Thomson (JT) cycle cryocoolers. It is based on Ball's efficient two stage Stirling cycle cryocooler, the SB 235 E, which provides {{the bulk of the}} refrigeration. It supplies well in excess of 8 W at 80 K for optics cooling in addition to approximately 2 W at 35 K for intercepting parasitic loads associated with the JT cryostat. The JT system uses a custom "Oxford " style linear compressor equipped with reed valves to circulate neon through a compact cold head. The cold head consists of high efficiency counter flow heat exchangers, heat sinks, and a very special internal thermal storage unit (ITSU) mounted in a rigid support structure. The ITSU, basically a tank for holding liquid neon, provides the system's load leveling capability. During the high load part of the focal plane's operating cycle, the JT compressor speeds up to increase the circulation rate of the coolant to the 35 K <b>interface,</b> <b>drawing</b> down the stored neon in the process. In this way it can provide instantaneous cooling that is several times greater than the precooler's average refrigeration power.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory {{investigation of the}} manufacturing/marketing (hereafter M/M) <b>interface.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the literature and prior empirical work in M/M strategies, we propose a path model for assessing the mediating impact of the M/M interface harmony—the functions ’ ability to work together—on M/M morale and business performance. Using two convenience samples of executives, we empirically test the direct and indirect influence of predisposing factors (antecedents) and performance outcomes (consequences) that are expected theoretically to influence or be influenced by M/M interface harmony. We find that 11 of the 13 hypothesized direct effects are significant at the 0. 012 level or below; and attesting to the mediating influence of the M/M ability to work together, 11 of the 12 indirect effects were significant at the 0. 02 level or below. Increasing {{the emphasis on the}} importance of marketing or manufacturing, or both, improves the ability of both functions to work harmoniously, which in turn impacts M/M morale. Interfunctional harmony appears to have a stronger influence on each function’s morale than the importance attached to that function, ceteris paribus. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study provides insight on the distinctive roles whereby marketing and manufacturing functions influence performance. Marketing acts to improve competitive position and profitability through the mediating influence of M/M interface harmony and improved marketing morale. However, manufacturing morale was not shown to be a significant factor impacting performance. Rather, emphasis on manufacturing impacts competitive position directly, as indicated by the resource-based view of manufacturin...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{primarily}} experimental design, {{this study}} investigated whether discussion boards in online community college philosophy classes can be designed in the Blackboard course management system to lead to higher order thinking. Discussions were designed using one of two teaching techniques: the activation of prior knowledge {{or the use of}} peer review. While these techniques are often identified as components of constructivist pedagogy, the study is grounded theoretically in epistemological holism. The literature calls for deeper research on prior knowledge/peer review and higher order thinking, and the relationship between them. Four eight week classes were studied, using two specific discussions from each class (one on Rene Descartes’ certainty, and the other on Aristotle’s eudemonia), the experimental and control groups switching from one discussion to the next. In the experimental groups, the prior knowledge technique was implemented before the discussions in the form of multiple choice questions and open ended questions; peer review was implemented via the Blackboard peer review <b>interface,</b> <b>drawing</b> from category coding from the literature. Control groups were given standard discussion prompts. Higher order thinking was assessed from multiple choice quiz question responses as well as instructor scoring (found to be reliable) of student discussion board prompts. All quantitative data was analyzed using quantitative analysis software. My primary hypothesis, that there would be more evidence of higher order thinking in experimental groups, was not substantiated by the data. However, considering that the overall level of higher order thinking of students in the study was high, this lack of substantiation {{may have something to do}} with the ceiling effect. Also, there were statistically significant correlations between demographic variables (specifically gender and age) and higher order thinking.

40|$|Border {{theory and}} Boundary theory have {{recently}} been introduced to provide a framework to examine the work-family <b>interface.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on these theories, as well as Role theory and General and Family System theory, I developed and tested a theoretical model of boundary management practices (i. e., boundary flexibility and inter-domain transitions) with the family domain as a focal system. To test the theoretical model, a field survey study with working adults involved in long-term cohabiting relationships was conducted. Structural equation modeling procedures were {{used to test the}} model with an analysis sample of 311 dyads (i. e., couples). The Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) was used to account for interdependence of data in relationship dyads. As expected, boundary flexibility was positively related to inter-domain transitions for both partners in both domains. In turn, the frequency of inter-domain transitions was positively related to experiences of work-family conflict. Also, as expected, a negative feedback loop was observed between work-to-family transitions and family role overload for both partners. Work and family overload were also related to experiences of work-family conflict as well as life stress, as expected. Family-to-work conflict, but not work-to-family conflict, was also related to life stress. A positive reciprocal feedback loop (i. e., dyadic crossover effect) was observed between partner 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of life stress. While the two other predicted crossover effects were not supported, several other unanticipated, and thus exploratory, effects were observed and included in the final empirical model. Past research on the work-family interface has been criticized for its failure to function within a strong theoretical paradigm. Results from the current study demonstrate that Boundary theory is a viable and important theoretical framework {{that can be used to}} examine the work-family interface. Only by developing research studies that adequately represent the complexities working adults face while drawing on strong theoretical frameworks can work-family researchers hope to have a positive influence on organizational changes intended to improve not only an employee 2 ̆ 7 s working environment, but their life as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the concepts of}} uncertainty and surprise as key variables of a socio-ecological system&# 8217;s behavior {{in the context of}} the theory of complexity. Experiences from the past have shown that living with uncertainty is part of our daily life and surprises are only surprising because our perspective of system trajectories is basically linear and non-dynamic. The future of humanity is dependent on the understanding of the system&# 8217;s behavior and needs a change in perspective of linearity to non-linearity and from the planning imperative to a management hedging uncertainty and surprise. In the context of humanity&# 8217;s future, the theory of complexity offers a new perspective on system trajectories and their understanding of surprises and uncertainty. There is a need for a Gestaltwechsel&# 8212;a change in perception&# 8212;which helps to see things differently and fosters the search for new answers to emerging questions at the human-nature <b>interface.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the case study of hazard management the paper will explain the necessity of analysis system&# 8217;s behavior and the taking into account of multi-agent behavior on the micro level which led to emergent behavior on the macro-level of the system. Regional geohazards are explained as the regional impact of an uncontrolled risk based on a state of a natural feature that has a direct impact on a regional population being affected by the appearance of a hazard and its development into damage. By acting in space, time and connectivity, people construct hazardscapes and change risk into regional geohazards. This concept shows relevance for future mitigation and adaptation measures. The theory of complexity can help in engendering the necessary shift in perspective. What is non-linear dynamic thinking as suggested by the theory of complexity? Why is the consideration of the system&# 8217;s behavior crucial and not just the number of system&# 8217;s elements? What is the role of agents in these systems? In addition, there are practical implications too: What does this shift in perspective mean for future hazard management and the future of humanity...|$|E
