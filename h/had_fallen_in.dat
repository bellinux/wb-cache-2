5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> abeyance. As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} was a fair target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released from the Tower of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies. He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two, the Garland and Foresight belonged to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{victories}} {{had been}} short-lived. The Sultan {{had called to}} his aid his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who had dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, later adding a further 25,000 troops. Ibrahim’s intervention proved decisive: the Peloponnese had been reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> 1826; Athens had been taken in 1827. All that Greek nationalists still held was Nafplion, Hydra, Mani and Aegina.|$|E
5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man with whom she <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for {{the hustle and bustle}} and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> the space of 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that {{he had become a}} vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Between 1715 – {{the year}} of Louis's death – and 1723, power {{transferred}} to the Régence; the regent, Philippe d'Orléans, maintained the prison but the absolutist rigour of Louis XIV's system began to weaken somewhat. Although Protestants ceased {{to be kept in}} the Bastille, the political uncertainties and plots of the period kept the prison busy and 1,459 were imprisoned there under the Regency, an average of around 182 a year. During the Cellamare Conspiracy, the alleged enemies of the Regency were imprisoned in the Bastille, including Marguerite De Launay. While in the Bastille, de Launay {{fell in love with a}} fellow prisoner, the Chevalier de Ménil; she also infamously received an invitation of marriage from the Chevalier de Maisonrouge, the governor's deputy, who <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love with her himself.|$|E
5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E

5|$|During the {{pre-production}} {{stages of}} Entre a Mi Mundo, Selena and Pérez <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love—despite their fellow band members warning them about Abraham. Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely {{to avoid a}} negative reaction from Abraham. After finding out about their relationship, Abraham fired Pérez from the group just weeks before the album was due to be released, and threatened to disband the group if Selena went after Pérez. Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her father would have never approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E
5|$|In 1438, {{another of}} John Manners' sons, Robert, {{inherited}} the castle and the estates. The lands <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> value considerably over the preceding years, {{as a result}} of the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother's side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family around the end of the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.|$|E
5|$|In 1656 {{relations}} between Rupert and Charles Louis deteriorated badly. Rupert <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love with Louise von Degenfeld, {{one of his}} sister-in-law's maids of honour. One of Rupert's notes proffering his affections accidentally fell into the possession of Charles Louis' wife Charlotte, who believed it was written to her. Charlotte was keen to engage in an affair with Rupert and became unhappy when she was declined and the mistake explained. Unfortunately, von Degenfeld was uninterested in Rupert, but was engaged in an affair with Charles Louis—this was discovered in due course, leading to the annulment of the marriage. Rupert, for his part, was unhappy that Charles Louis could not endow him with a suitable estate, and the two parted on bad terms in 1657, Rupert refusing to ever return to the Palatinate again and taking up employment under Ferdinand III in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, at 19, {{she married}} Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately {{believed}} {{by family and}} friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At {{the downfall of the}} Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the Crimea with her husband and children, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love with.|$|E
5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> love.|$|E
