50|$|<b>Kokum</b> <b>butter</b> is {{non-greasy}} {{and gets}} {{absorbed into the}} skin once it is applied. It is often used {{as a substitute for}} cocoa butter due to its triglyceride composition. <b>Kokum</b> <b>butter</b> also contains antioxidants and vitamin E. <b>Kokum</b> <b>butter</b> exhibits excellent emollient properties and high oxidative stability, which can assist emulsion integrity. With its relatively higher melt point, it melts slightly at skin temperatures, making it ideal for lipsticks and balms. It is also added in the making of bar soaps and skin lotions. <b>Kokum</b> <b>butter</b> is also used to treat dry lips, chapped hands and soles of the feet.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} {{disagreement}} in the EU about {{the definition of}} chocolate; this dispute covers several ingredients, including the types of fat used, quantity of cocoa, and so on. In 1999, however, the EU at least resolved the fat issue by allowing up to 5% of chocolate's content {{to be one of}} 5 alternatives to cocoa butter: illipe oil, palm oil, sal, shea <b>butter,</b> <b>kokum</b> gurgi, or mango kernel oil.|$|R
50|$|Table-physical-chemical {{properties}} of oilKokum oil contains up to 60-65 percent saturated fatty acid, making it solid at room temperature, so this oil {{is known as}} <b>kokum</b> <b>butter</b> or kokum fat. Its triglyceride composition is uniform and consists of up to 80% of stearic-oleic-stearic (SOS) triglycerides. The butter melts readily on contact with the skin.|$|E
40|$|The work {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the compositional data of vegetable fats used or proposed as alternatives to cocoa butte in chocolate and confectionary products. These fats are mostly mixtures of various vegetable fats often modified) and can consist of palm and palm kernel oil, illipe fat, shea butter, sal fat and <b>kokum</b> <b>butter.</b> In addition, a large variety of other vegetable oils can be used. Their composition according to triglycerides, fatty acids, sterols and other unsaponifiable components is discussed. Moreover we review {{the literature on}} analytical methods suitable for the detection and identification and determination of foreign fats in cocoa butter and chocolate. None of the methods reviewed here, allows the unequivocal quantification or just detection of foreign fats in chocolate. It is proposed to combine a number of techniques with a chemometric approach to develop unique patterns allowing the unequivocal detection and quantification foreign fats without having prior knowledge regarding the kind of fat added.
