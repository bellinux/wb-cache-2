5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

5|$|Over 1,000people {{evacuated}} {{to emergency}} shelters on Grenada, including hundreds in low-lying {{areas in the}} capital city. Some shelters were damaged during the hurricane, forcing the evacuees to <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Overall, the population responded little to the official advisories and recommendations, which potentially contributed to the death toll on the island. More than 1,000residents of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines evacuated to 28emergency shelters. On Barbados, officials closed schools and government buildings and prepared shelters prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. To minimize danger, the island power grid was shut down. Four shelters opened on Saint Lucia, where many people sought safety during the storm.|$|E

5|$|The twelfth-century Renaissance {{resulted}} {{in the emergence of}} some major intellectual figures from Scotland. Probably the most significant was John Duns Scotus (c. 1265–1308), a major influence on late medieval religious thought. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in 1296, English universities were largely closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant. Just over a thousand Scots have been identified as attending continental universities between the twelfth century and 1410. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities, such as Walter Wardlaw (died 1387) and Laurence de Lindores (1372?–1437). This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics but would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. In this period Scottish universities did not teach Greek, focused on metaphysics and put a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Scottish scholars continued to study on the Continent and at English universities which reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the fifteenth}} century, those {{who wished to}} attend {{university}} had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 {{have been identified as}} doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among these the most important intellectual figure was John Duns Scotus, who studied at Oxford, Cambridge and Paris and probably died at Cologne in 1308, becoming a major influence on late Medieval religious thought. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris this included John De Rate and Walter Wardlaw in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores in the early 1500s. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere</b> and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which John Mair was probably the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school, then Cambridge, before moving to Paris, where he matriculated in 1493. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life.|$|E

25|$|Guadalupita (full name Guadalupe Yancuitlapan) is a {{small town}} which has been known for the making of wool {{garments}} for over 200 years.

The most traditional of these textiles are made from local wool, dyed, carded and spun by the craftsperson.

25|$|A {{file system}} can present a file of a {{particular}} type as a volume in its own right, similar to a loop device. The OS refers to this functionality as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and network share filesystems put a reference inside the image file and <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere</b> for the data.|$|E

When Lane joined Eaton to form the new Midnight Express it put the final nail in the coffin of the Fabulous Ones, ending their 5-year run.

25|$|The narrator (Phil Rice) {{states that}} {{increased}} cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules {{regarding the use}} of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to <b>go</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.|$|E
