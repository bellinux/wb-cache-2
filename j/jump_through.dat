5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> a series of seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles {{as a form of}} health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E

25|$|The Florida State Drama Award {{included}} {{a scholarship to}} the Hyde Park Playhouse, a summer stock theater, in Hyde Park, New York. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically-demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met Joanne Woodward, who helped him find an agent, and was cast in Tea and Sympathy at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. After his Broadway debut Look, We've Come Through, he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the cast, driving the bus and appearing on stage. After the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes. His classmates included Frank Gifford, Carol Lawrence, Red Buttons, and Jan Murray. After a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but he soon got a part in a revival of Mister Roberts, in which Charlton Heston played the starring role. After the play closed, the director, John Forsythe, arranged a film audition with Joshua Logan for Reynolds. The film was Sayonara. Reynolds {{was told that he}} could not be in the film because he looked too much like Marlon Brando. Logan advised Reynolds to go to Hollywood, but Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so. He worked in a variety of different jobs, such as waiting tables, washing dishes, driving a delivery truck and as a bouncer at the Roseland Ballroom. While working as a dockworker, Reynolds writes that he was offered $150 to <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> a glass window on a live television show.|$|E

500|$|F.E.A.R.s {{artificial}} intelligence allows computer-controlled characters {{a large degree}} of action. Enemies can duck to travel under crawlspaces, <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> windows, vault over railings, climb ladders, and push over large objects to create cover. Various opponents may act as a team, taking back routes to surprise the player, using suppressive fire or taking cover if under fire. The game's {{artificial intelligence}} is often cited as being highly advanced, using an architecture known as Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) and its efficiency helped the game win GameSpot's [...] "2005 Best AI Award", and earn the #2 ranking on AIGameDev's [...] "Most Influential AI Games".|$|E

500|$|A {{decision}} was made to try again for Olympic recognition was made, but the Federation was irritated because they had never been given clear guidelines for what the IOC was looking for in terms of a sport gaining Olympic recognition. [...] The Federation believed that every time they met the criteria they were given, there was a new hoop for them to <b>jump</b> <b>through.</b> [...] An example of this was a requirement given to the Federation 1992/1993 that the IOC be given technical specs for venue space should the sport be included on the Olympic programme. [...] The Federation continued to work to address these requirements and eventually, in October 1993, netball through IFNA was given provisional Olympic recognition, requiring a two-year probation period. [...] This recognition came with a [...] per year per region for the Federation to develop the sport around the world.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them {{to the day when}} the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E

Many feel that they cannot depart from the restrictions of the national curriculum".|$|E
2500|$|The cast {{features}} 14 {{major roles}} with star billing, {{all of whom}} return from the fourth season. Because the storyline follows two different time periods, the cast is largely broken into two groups. The first storyline follows the {{group of people who}} have left the island: the survivors' leader Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), ex-fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), mentally unstable millionaire Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia), former torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), grieving wife Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), three-year islander Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), former leader of the island's native population, known as the Others. The second follows those who remain on the island as they erratically <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> time, following the island being moved in the fourth-season finale. They are crash survivor and con man James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), former Other and fertility specialist Dr. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), crash survivor and former enforcer Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who survived the explosion of the freighter, and three members of a science team from a freighter offshore, who have joined the crash survivors: medium Miles Straume (Ken Leung), anthropologist Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), and physicist Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). The only main character to be involved in both storylines is John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), who, {{at the end of the}} fourth season, leaves his fellow crash survivors to become the new leader of the Others. However, following the first <b>jump</b> <b>through</b> time, he rejoins the crash survivors and eventually leaves the island and dies, which prompts the other survivors who have left the island to return with his body. The character of Charlotte is written out in the fifth episode of the season, as well as Faraday in the fourteenth and overall one hundredth episode.|$|E
