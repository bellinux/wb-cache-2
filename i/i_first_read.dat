I heard his voice, that's what it sounded like – full of wonderment and confusion about everything. That, to me, was Hugh." [...] Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the [...] finale/ opener [...] "", which he felt was similar to his previous ideas.|$|E
500|$|Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods {{was listed}} in 2012 credits as the film's inspiration, and Emmerich {{said in a}} Time Out interview: [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook. <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods." [...] He and composer-producer Harald Kloser worked closely together, co-writing a spec script (also {{entitled}} 2012) which was marketed to studios in February2008. A number of studios heard a budget projection and story plans from Emmerich and his representatives, a process repeated by the director after Independence Day (1996) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E

500|$|Hurd {{recalled}} {{that she had}} heard of the comic before, and upon reading it, felt that it would be great for film. She stated: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. Then I heard it wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E
500|$|Haynes {{had first}} heard about the film in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting to me when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself.

500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by David Arnold, {{played by the}} Sinfonia of London and conducted by Nicholas Dodd. It was the second motion picture Arnold had composed and the first major motion picture. At the time of production, Arnold had recently started {{to work in a}} local video store in London. Once hired, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it as delays were being created due to film companies trying to get the rights to distribution. According to Arnold [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the script for StarGate, I knew what approach to take, which was to be as big and bold as possible," [...] he kept on saying: [...] "Every time there was an amazing sight, the characters would stand back and say, 'Oh my God!'
