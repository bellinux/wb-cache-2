5|$|The Forge <b>junction</b> at Telford Town Centre {{was awarded}} {{relatively}} late, {{to the company}} Norwest Holst. The <b>junction</b> precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join and exit in both directions. The Forge to Cluddley section, from <b>junction</b> 5 to <b>junction</b> 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park to Forge section, from the M6 to <b>junction</b> 5, opened in November 1983. The motorway cost 65 million pounds to build, which when adjusted for inflation would come to approximately 150 million 2006 GBP.|$|E

5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth <b>Junction</b> Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen <b>Junction</b> Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth <b>Junction</b> and Inverness & Aberdeen <b>Junction</b> merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E

In the conventional thin sections, desmosomes, intermediate <b>junctions</b> (maculae adherentes) and gap <b>junctions</b> were observed, and in the lanthanum-fixed sections, tight <b>junctions</b> (maculae occludentes) were demonstrated as well. In the freeze-fracture replicas, desmosomes, gap <b>junctions,</b> tight <b>junctions</b> and combination forms of gap and tight <b>junctions</b> occurred, but intermediate <b>junctions</b> were not identified. Junctional complexes (zonulae occludentes) were not encountered in any preparations. The gap <b>junctions</b> varied in size and shape; they ranged from irregularly shaped, minute assemblages of particles to large aggregations of a round or elliptic outline. Both the tight <b>junctions</b> and the combination forms of gap and tight <b>junctions</b> also exhibited a variety of shape and dimension, and, depending on {{the form of the}} tight junctional strands, they were classified into three types: type I consisted of a simple line of strands; type II consisted of a closed network of strands; and type III consisted of an open network of strands. The combination forms were more numerous than the typical tight <b>junctions.</b> The possible significance of these <b>junctions</b> is discussed in relation to the function of the parathyroid parenchymal cell...|$|R

40|$|Intercellular <b>junctions</b> in the mesothelium of the visceral (mesentery and omentum), and parietal (diaphragm, pre-aortic, and iliac region) {{peritoneum}} {{were examined}} in rats and mice by using freeze-cleaved preparations. In addition to usual intercellular <b>junctions</b> (cell body <b>junctions),</b> special <b>junctions</b> are found between cell processes and {{the surface of the}} neighboring cell (cell process <b>junctions).</b> Cell body <b>junctions</b> are provided with tight <b>junctions</b> and communicating (gap) <b>junctions.</b> The former consist of one to two junctional strands which show a characteristic staggered arrangement, and focal discontinuities. In cell process <b>junctions,</b> the strands form loops or appear as short, free-ending elements; their polymorphism suggests considerable lability, probably in connection with their assembly and disassembly. The existence of free-ending strands indicates that such structures can be used as attachment devices without being concomitantly involved in the formation of occluding zonules. In both types of <b>junctions,</b> the strands can be resolved into bars, approximately 80 - 100 nm long, frequently provided with terminal enlargements and intercalated particles which occur singly or in small clusters. These particles are morphologically similar to those present in communicating (gap) <b>junctions.</b> The mesothelium is also provided with isolate composite macular <b>junctions.</b> Throughout the mesothelium, the cleavage plane follows the outer contour of junctional strands and particles, suggesting that strand-to-strand interactions in the apposed membranes are weaker than interactions between each strand and underlying cytoplasmic structures. In their general geometry and cleavage characteristics, the mesothelial <b>junctions</b> resemble the <b>junctions</b> found in the venular endothelium...|$|R
