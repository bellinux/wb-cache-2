50|$|In particular, the East Asian crisis (1997-1998) {{is widely}} {{known as a}} {{large-scale}} financial crisis caused by {{the combination of the}} three policies which violate the impossible trinity. The East Asian countries were taking a de facto dollar peg (fixed exchange rate), promoting the free movement of capital (free capital flow) and making independent monetary policy at the same time. First, because of the de facto dollar peg, foreign investors could invest in Asian countries without the risk of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> Second, the free flow of capital kept foreign investment uninhibited. Third, the short-term interest rates of Asian countries were higher than the short-term interest rate of the United States from 1990-1999. For these reasons, many foreign investors invested enormous amounts of money in Asian countries and reaped huge profits. While the Asian countries' trade balance was favorable, the investment was pro-cyclical for the countries. But when the Asian countries' trade balance shifted, investors quickly retrieved their money, triggering the Asian crisis. Eventually countries such as Thailand ran out of dollar reserves and were forced to let their currencies float and devalue. Since many short term debt obligations were denoted in US dollars, debts grew substantially and many businesses had to shut down and declare bankruptcy.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} reasons why a country's {{monetary}} and/or fiscal authority may want {{to intervene in the}} foreign exchange market. Central banks generally agree that the primary objective of foreign exchange market intervention is to manage the volatility and/or influence the level of the exchange rate. Governments prefer to [...] the exchange rate because excessive short-term volatility erodes market confidence and affects both the financial market and the real goods market. When there is inordinate instability, exchange rate uncertainty generates extra costs and reduces profits for firms. As a result, investors are unwilling to make investment in foreign financial assets. Firms are reluctant to engage in international trade. Moreover, the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> would spill over into the financial markets. If the exchange rate volatility increases the risk of holding domestic assets, then prices of these assets would also become more volatile. The increased volatility of financial markets would threaten the stability of the financial system and make monetary policy goals more difficult to attain. Therefore, authorities conduct currency intervention. In addition, when economic conditions change or when the market misinterprets economic signals, authorities use foreign exchange intervention to correct exchange rates, in order to avoid overshooting of either direction. Anna Schwartz contended that the central bank can cause the sudden collapse of speculative excess, and that they can limit growth by constricting the money supply.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is centered on}} the nexus between exchange rate variation and economic growth in Nigeria with emphasis to the purchasing power of the average Nigerians {{and the level of}} international transaction. Exchange rate fluctuations have been of serious concern to the monetary authorities, policy makers and business tycoons of developing countries, Nigeria inclusive because of the relevance of exchange rate in international trade, investment and in determining the level of output growth of a country. Therefore it is vital to examine the degree at which exchange rate fluctuates which had called for a lot of attention in Nigeria. This study examined the Impact of <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Fluctuation</b> on the Nigerian Economic Growth using an annual data of forty-three (43) years covering the period (1970 - 2013). The standard deviation method was employed to capture and estimate the fluctuation inherent in the model as regards the research’s objective. The study employed econometric techniques such as; Multiple Regression Model, Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, Johansen Co-integration test and the Error Correction Model (ECM). Evidence from this study exhibited that there exists a positive but insignificant impact of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> on Nigerian economic growth in both the long run and short run. This result is attributed to the ability of the Nigerian government to effectively regulate some other important macroeconomic variables which can infuriate exchange rate which has thereby helped curtail the effects of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> during the study period. This is an indication that monetary authorities might have initiated policies that helped absorb the influence of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> on economic growth in Nigeria. Therefore, the government should encourage domes-tic production of goods and services for Naira exchange rate appreciation and generally to promote economic growth in Nigeria- moreover to maintain and sustain exchange rate and economic stability. In the same vein, the government should pay more attention to other more volatile macroeconomic variables like oil price and inflation rate in Nigeria.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} exchange rate volatility on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria. The flow and stock market theories of exchange rate determination was adopted considering macroeconomic determinants such as balance of trade, trade openness, and net international investment. Furthermore, the influence of changes in parallel exchange rate, official exchange rate and {{real effective exchange rate}} was modeled on the manufacturing sector output. Vector autoregression techniques and vector error correction mechanism were adopted to explore the macroeconomic determinants of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in Nigeria and to examine the influence of exchange rate volatility on the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. The exchange rate showed an unstable and volatile movement in Nigeria. Official exchange rate significantly impacted on the manufacturing sector of Nigeria and shock to previous manufacturing sector output caused 60. 76 % of the fluctuation in the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Trade balance, trade openness and net international investments did not significantly determine exchange rate in Nigeria. However, own shock accounted for about 95 % of the variation of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the short-run and long-run. Among other macroeconomic variables, net international investment accounted for about 2. 85 % variation of the real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the short-run and in the long-run. Monetary authorities should maintain stability of the exchange rates through proper management so as to encourage local production and government should formulate and implement policies that will develop other sectors of the economy as this will widen the country’s revenue base, reduce our over reliance on oil sector for our foreign exchange earnings and in turn reduce the shocks on our domestic economy...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} shocks {{affecting}} {{participants in the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe asymmetrically is an important concern of both economists and policy makers. The present paper focuses on the likelihood of asymmetric shocks in Europe originating from the impact of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on trade. It identifies two necessary conditions for such asymmetric shocks to occur: <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuations</b> should have different impacts across sectors and countries should have different industrial specialization. Using data of bilateral imports of the EMU members from other countries, this paper estimates the elasticity of trade to <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes for 42 industrial sectors. It finds that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fluctuations</b> do indeed have different impacts across sectors. Examining the pattern of industrial specialization in Europe shows that there are non-negligible dissimilarities among members' industrial structure. The two conditions identified hold in Europe and the occurrence of asymmetric shocks within the euro area can be expected. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.
