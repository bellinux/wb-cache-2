In MPC we have a set of parties owning a set of private <b>inputs.</b> The <b>parties</b> want to compute a function of their inputs, but they do not trust each other, therefore they need a cryptographic protocol to perform the computation in a way that 1) the output is correct and 2) cheating parties will not be able to learn any information about the honest <b>parties</b> <b>inputs.</b> Even though this problem has been formulated and essentially solved almost 30 years ago, practical solutions that can be relevant for real-world applications have been discovered only in the last few years.

We initiate a quantitative investigation of the power of randomness, in the context of communication complexity. We prove general lower bounds on the length of the random <b>input</b> of <b>parties</b> computing a function f, depending on the number of bits communicated and the deterministic communication complexity of f. Four standard models for Communication Complexity are considered: the random <b>input</b> of the <b>parties</b> may be shared or local, and the communication may be one-way or two-way. The bounds are shown to be tight. Namely, we demonstrate functions and protocols for these functions which meet the above bounds up to a constant factor.

However variety in mobile models and systems makes it difficult to develop a general input method for different models. As design pattern usually add reusability and flexibility to software development process, we propose an approach to develop input method for mobile using state design pattern. With the idea of event-based finite state machine, we design a novel event-condition-state pattern framework. We use it develop a thirty <b>party</b> <b>input</b> method system which contains a Windows Mobile system version and a Symbian system version. We utilized common part of the systems with sub pattern model and then rewrote related interfaces to different systems, instead of carrying out two developing activities. With the state design pattern, the whole development process turns to simpler and clearer, saving us much work in design and developing. It also provides convenience for future maintenance and updating as well. Index Terms—software developing, design pattern, mobile developing, mobile input method I...|$|R

The analysis suggests that policy <b>inputs</b> by <b>parties</b> of the right have been significantly more vulnerable to exogenous contagion effects by the FN.

40|$|Abstract. An {{extended}} permutation is {{a function}} f: { 1, [...] .,m} → { 1, [...] ., n}, used to map an n-element vector a to an m-element vector b by bi = af(i). An oblivious extended permutation allows this map-ping to be done while preserving the privacy of a, b and f in a secure multiparty computation protocol. Oblivious extended permutations have several uses, with private function evaluation (PFE) being the theoreti-cally most prominent one. In this paper, we propose a new technique for oblivious evaluation of extended permutations. Our construction {{is at least as}} efficient as the existing techniques, conceptually simpler, and has wider applicability. Our technique allows the party providing the description of f to be ab-sent during the computation phase of the protocol. Moreover, that party does not even have to exist — we show how to compute the private rep-resentation of f from private data that may itself be computed from the <b>inputs</b> of <b>parties.</b> In other words, our oblivious extended permutations can be freely composed with other privacy-preserving operations in a multiparty computation...|$|R

The model, re-ferred {{to as the}} adversarial sketch model, unifies the well-studied sketch and data stream models together with a cryptographic flavor that considers the execution of protocols in “hostile en-vironments”, and provides a framework for studying the complexity of many tasks involving massive data sets. In the adversarial sketch model several parties are interested in computing a joint function {{in the presence of}} an adversary that dynamically chooses their inputs. These inputs are provided to the parties in an on-line manner, and each party incrementally updates a compressed sketch of its <b>input.</b> The <b>parties</b> are not allowed to communicate, they do not share any secret information, and any public information they share is known to the adversary in advance.

The unique context of each case that spurs judicial involvement will often affect a plan more than will universal factors common to all such cases.

40|$|This {{extended}} abstract {{present a}} general theorem {{in the field}} of fault tolerant distributed computing. Following is a simplified description of a special case of this theorem. Loosely speaking, a protocol problem is a multi-argument function f and its solution is a multi-party fault-tolerant protocol having the following two properties: (1) Correctness: The protocol allows each party to obtain the value of the function on arguments scattered among all the parties. Namely, the local <b>input</b> of <b>party</b> P i is x i, and his local output (obtained by execution of the protocol) is f(x 1; x 2; :::; x n). (2) Privacy: Whatever a party (P i) can efficiently compute after participating in the protocol, he can also efficiently compute from his local input (x i) and his local output (i. e. f(x 1; x 2; :::; x n)). In other words, participating in the protocol is equivalent to getting f(x 1; x 2; :::; x n) from a trusted oracle. For example, if f(x 1; x 2; :::; x n) = P n i= 1 x i then [...] ...|$|R

We provide a universal way to obtain Bell inequality violations of general Bell functionals from XOR games for which the quotient ω_o. w. -c^*(G) /ω_o. w. - 2 c(G) is larger than 1. This allows, in particular, to find (unbounded) Bell inequality violations from communication complexity problems in the same spirit as the recent work by Buhrman et al. (2016).
