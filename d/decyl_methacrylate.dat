This thesis concerns the self-assembly process and dynamics in block copolymers with hierarchical order. The {{second and third}} chapters discuss peptide-based poly(γ-benzyl-Lglutamate) -poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) triblock copolymers and side-group liquid crystal polystyrene-poly [2 -(((3 -cholesteryl) -oxy) carbonyl) <b>decyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> ] diblock copolymers. In the first case, the morphology was revealed and the peptide secondary structure was probed {{by a combination of}} scattering and microscopy techniques.

40|$|The {{result of}} {{a study on the}} {{copolymerisation}} of methacrylate (MMA) with varying mol fractions of octyl methacrylate, <b>decyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DMA), lauryl methacrylate (LMA) and stearyl methacrylate (SMA) by free radical polymerisation using benzoyl peroxide as the initiator are presented. It was anticipated that incorporation of alkyl methacrylate (AMA) having a long alkyl side chain in poly(methyl methadrylate) (PMMA) backbone may lead to an improvement in the toughness of the cast sheets. Such copolymers can be used for low temperature applications in defence. The glass transition temperature of the polymers determined using differential scanning calorimetry was found to decrease with increase in length of the alkyl side chain and the comonomer content. A significant increase in percentage elongation and decrease in tensile strength, modulus and per cent transmittance was observed on incorporation of AMA in PMMA backbone. In the copolymers of SMA and MMA, significant opacity was observed. </span...|$|E
40|$|Novel solid-contact {{perchlorate}} sensors {{based on}} cobalt phthalocyanine-C-monocarboxylic acid (I), and cobalt phthalocyanine-C,C,C,C-tetracarboxylic acid (II) as free ionophores and covalently attached to polyacryla- mide (PAA) —ionophores III and IV, respectively were prepared. The all solid-state sensors were {{constructed by the}} application of a thin film of a polymer cocktail containing a phthalocyanine ionophore and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) as a lipophilic cationic additive onto a gold electrode precoated with the conducting polymer poly (3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as an ion and electron transducer. The sensor with 10. 3 % of ionophore (III) covalently attached to plasticizer-free poly (butyl methacrylate-co-do- <b>decyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> (PBDA) exhibited a good selectivity for perchlorate and discriminated many ions, in- cluding F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SCN–,, S 2 – and. The covalent attachment of the ionophore to the polymer resulted in a near-Nernstian anionic slope of – 62. 3 mV/decade whereas a super-Nernstian slope of – 79. 9 mV/ decade was obtained for the free ionophore. The sensor covered a linear concentration range of 5 × 10 – 9 - 1 × 10 – 2 mol?L– 1 with a lower detection limit (LDL) of 1 × 10 – 9 mol?L– 1 and gave a stable response over a pH range of 4 - 10. 5. The all-solid state sensors were utilized for the selective flow injection potentiometric determination of perchlorate in natural water and human urine samples in the nanomolar concentration range...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} a range of novel liquid crystalline pyrazine based compounds as potential neutral ionophores, for use in ion selective electrodes and to investigate the effect of their liquid crystal properties on ionophoric behaviour. The ionophores were initially incorporated into poly (vinyl chloride) matrix membranes and tested for their analytical usefulness as ion-selective electrodes, for the potentiometric response {{of a range of}} monovalent and divalent cations. Two series of electrodes were fabricated, Series A and Series B. Series A incorporated o- nitrophenyl octyl ether as membrane plasticiser, which is used extensively in PVC membrane ion-selective electrodes commercially and for research purposes. The potentiometric results found the ionophore 2 -n-hexyloxy- 5 -(4 -bromophenyl) pyrazine to exhibit a near-Nernstian response for caesium ions over a concentration range of 10 [sup]- 1 - 10 [sup]- 5 M. Selectivity coefficient values suggest this electrode is more responsive towards caesium ions in the presence of interfering ions, but this electrode is not comparable with or better than the current commercially available one which incorporates calix[6] arenehexakis(carboxymethylether) -hexakis(ethylester) as ionophoric material. The Series B set of electrodes incorporated a liquid crystal mixture, known commercially as E 7, as a membrane placticiser. This was also used to generate an ionophoric system in the liquid crystal phase at room temperature. E 7 or any liquid crystal material has not been used as plasticiser or ionophoric material for use in ion-selective electrodes to date. The potentiometric results found the electrode, incorporating the ionophore 2 -n-hexyloxy- 5 -(4 - bromophenyl) pyrazine, to exhibit a near-Nernstian response of 55. 18 mV decade[sup]- 1 over a concentration range 10 [sup]- 1 - 10 [sup]- 5 M. The selectivity of this electrode was much improved in comparison to that from Series A and was comparable with the current commercially available one. By changing the internal reference solution from 10 [sup]- 1 M caesium chloride solution to 10 [sup]- 1 M ammonium chloride solution this electrode can be used as an ammonium sensor in the absence of caesium ions. The influence of the liquid crystal properties of the selected pyrazine ionophore on the potentiometric behaviour, was firstly attempted by immersing the electrode in a heated sample of the test solution. and then allowing the solution to cool to the ionophores liquid crystal monotropic smectic A phase temperature. With the high temperatures involved it was found the PVC membrane blistered. Secondly, with the influence of E 7 exhibiting plasticising properties, and showing a nematic liquid crystal phase at room temperature, it was possible to overwhelm the pyrazine ionophore with E 7 resulting in converting the smectic A phase to a nematic mixture at room temperature. The added advantage of using E 7 is that the nematic phase is easily influenced by the application of an external electric field. This would enable to electronically reorientate the molecular structure and hence see what influence this would have on the performance of the electrode. A number of alternative polymer matrices were investigated to see which allowed the best dispersion of E 7 and the ionophore, as PVC did not show a response to the molecular switching at low voltages. Norland Optical Adhesive 65, a photocurable polymer, and photopolymerised <b>decyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> both provided good matrices for the dispersion of E 7 and the ionophore with switching occurring at low voltages...|$|E
