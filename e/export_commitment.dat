40|$|The gas {{industry}} is perhaps Russia’s least reformed major sector. Prices are regulated, exports are monopolised and {{the domestic market}} is dominated by a state-controlled, vertically integrated monopolist, OAO Gazprom. Gazprom combines commercial and regulatory functions, and maintains tight control over the sector’s infrastructure and over information flows within it. The sector as it is currently constituted is highly unlikely {{to be able to}} sustain sufficient output growth to satisfy both rising <b>export</b> <b>commitments</b> and domestic demand. There is significant potential for accelerating the growth of non-Gazprom production and making gas supply in Russia more competitive, but this will require fundamental reform. The proposals for reform advanced in the paper address two sets of issues. First, there is an urgent need to increase transparency in the sector and transfer many of the regulatory functions now performed by Gazprom to state bodies. Secondly, there is a longer-term need for a considerable degree of unbundling of Gazprom. In particular, it would be desirable to remove control of the sector’s transport infrastructure from the company and to revise the arrangements governing gas exports to non-CIS states, which are currently monopolised by Gazprom. At the same time, recent increases in domestic gas tariffs must continue until internal gas prices rise above full, long-term cost-recovery levels...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{being one}} of Europeâs largest {{pipeline}} natural gas suppliers and the original and still very active supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) worldwide, Algeria has received limited serious attention as an exporter of gas in recent years. One {{reason may be that}} the countryâs key role has somewhat been eclipsed by new developments in both the European gas scene and in the broader global gas arenas. The geo-political aftermath of the 2014 tensions between Russia and Ukraine has turned attention to the European Unionâs increasing dependence on Russian gas. In addition, the start-up of substantial new LNG supplies {{over the next five years}} has emphasised the probability of global gas surplus and its likely impacts. Since the OIES Gas Programmeâs last paper on Algeria in 2011 several developments have taken place which warrant fresh insights on Algeriaâs natural gas sector trends and the outlook for its export potential. While the conclusions of the paper are not optimistic, the causal analysis has parallels in many gas resource-rich countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Sustained government policies of low domestic prices have neither encouraged rationalization of demand nor provided adequate incentives for upstream investment, ultimately resulting in a severe deterioration of national gas balances.

The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how the interplay between certain internal resources and capabilities and their interaction with the external environment contribute to export performance of internationalising firms in the agricultural, handicraft and manufacturing industries in Ghana. The study contributes specifically to the export performance literature that has featured in international business, international entrepreneurship and international marketing. This research employed the resource-based view as the underpinning theory to examine the internal and external characteristics of the firm to identify what determines export success for firms in these industries. The study applied a mixed method approach using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The data for this study consists of 116 questionnaire survey and 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants in the three industries in Ghana. Quantitative data analysis applied PLS-SEM and content analysis was undertaken to develop interview themes for the qualitative study. The study found that product and place (distribution) were the most adapted export marketing mix strategies (out of the 4 Ps that are a fundamental aspect of the marketing literature) for the firms, with promotion and price highlighted as the least adapted strategies. The relationship between international experience, <b>export</b> <b>commitment,</b> export marketing mix strategy (4 Ps), and export performance were supported across the models. <b>Export</b> <b>commitment,</b> place, product and foreign market attractiveness emerged as strong antecedents of export performance in the study. Drawing from resource based view of the firm, the study makes three key contribution to the export performance literature. First, it explains how exports market mix strategy transforms the impact of international experience, <b>export</b> <b>commitment</b> and export promotion programs on export performance. Secondly, it establishes moderating effects of foreign market attractiveness on the association between export marketing mix strategy and export performance.

In this setting we show that: (1) higher efficiency of R&D (like low trade costs) makes trade more easy (given that R&D increases the profitability of exports); (2) firms with higher commitment power in R&D are more competitive (since they have larger incentives to innovate) and as a result these firms also have better access to <b>export</b> markets. <b>commitment</b> power; endogenous asymmetric firms; market access; R&D investment...|$|R

40|$|Improve the firms’ {{effectiveness}} in export markets {{is essential to}} ensure the survival, growth and competitive advantage of exporting firms. Within export markets, firms face a dynamic environment, with a strong competition and rapid technological changes. Through the acquisition and development of internal resources and capabilities, exporting firms can respond more effectively to the competitive and turbulent environment of foreign markets, and thus achieve a superior performance. This is the central subject of this research, which seeks to identify the key resources and capabilities of exporting firms that contribute to increase their {{effectiveness in}} export markets. More specifically, this study: (1) develops a scale to measure innovation capability of exporting firms, identifies its key dimensions and tests the impact of all these dimensions on export venture performance; (2) examines the effect of technological turbulence {{on the development of}} organizational management dynamic capability, and investigates if organizational management dynamic capability contributes to leverage operational capabilities for innovation (i. e., innovativeness, innovation strategy and technological capability) in order to increase export market effectiveness; and (3) analyzes the influence of firms’ <b>export</b> <b>commitment</b> and innovativeness on the development of their marketing capabilities (i. e., pricing, new product development, marketing communication and distribution), and tests the effect of all these factors on export market effectiveness. An online survey was administrated to exporting manufacturing firms operating in Portugal. The results demonstrate that innovation capability of exporting firms is a higher-order construct formed by four dimensions: innovativeness, technological capability, innovation strategy and new product development capability. All four dimensions are positively and significantly related to export venture performance. The findings also demonstrate that technological turbulence has a significant influence on the development of organizational management dynamic capability, which, in turn, has a significant impact on firms’ operational capabilities for innovation, specifically innovativeness, innovation strategy, and technological capability. However, only innovation strategy and technological capability have a significant direct effect on export market effectiveness. Finally, <b>export</b> <b>commitment</b> has a significant influence on the degree of firms’ innovativeness, which, in turn, has {{a significant impact on the}} development of marketing capabilities.
