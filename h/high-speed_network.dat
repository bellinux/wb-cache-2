40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks</b> it is likely {{that a large number of}} packets are dropped in a single loss event on a {{bottleneck}} link and a large portion of the ongoing flows are about to experience packet losses.

We propose in this paper F 2 -TCP, a new loss-based congestion control protocol for <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks,</b> to achieve better fairness and TCP-friendliness.

25|$|In September 2009, Greengauge 21 {{published}} {{a new study}} into High Speed Rail. This was far more extensive than Network Rail's proposal, calling for a full, integrated <b>high-speed</b> <b>network</b> totalling around 1500km. Greengauge's plan calls for two north/south corridors from London, which would broadly parallel the ECML and WCML, together with three east/west corridors between London-Bristol, Sheffield-Manchester and Edinburgh-Glasgow. Both the north/south lines would consist of new-built high-speed lines, while the east/west corridors would run on existing lines upgraded to allow 200km/h running. One of the central parts of the Greengauge 21 proposal is to have it linked directly with High Speed 1, to allow through running to the Channel Tunnel, thus enabling trains to run direct from regional cities to Europe.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that TCP connections that go through multiple congested links (MCL) have a smaller transmission rate than the other connections. Such TCP behavior {{is a result of}} two components (i) the cumulative packet losses that a flow experiences at each router along its path; (ii) the longer round trip times (RTTs) suffered by such flows due to non-negligible queueing delays at congested routers. This double "bias" against connections with MCLs has been shown to approximate the so-called minimum potential delay fairness principle in the current Internet. Despite the recent proliferation of new congestion control proposals for TCP in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks,</b> it is still unclear what kind of fairness principle could be achieved with such newly proposed congestion control protocols in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks</b> with large-delays. Studies already show that some high-speed TCP variants may cause surprisingly severe RTT unfairness in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks</b> with DropTail routers. This paper studies the problem of unfairness in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks</b> with some well-known high-speed TCP variants in presence of multiple congested links and highlights the severity of such unfairness when DropTail queue management is adopted. Through a simple synchronized loss model analysis, we show how synchronized losses with DropTail in <b>high-speed</b> <b>networks</b> could lead to severe RTT unfairness and drop probability (DP) unfairness; while random marking AQM schemes, which break the packet loss synchrony mitigate such unfairness dramatically by ensuring that the packet loss probability of a flow is the sum of the loss probabilities on the congested routers it crosses. Extensive simulations are carried out and the results support our findings. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
