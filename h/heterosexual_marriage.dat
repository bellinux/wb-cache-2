5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Conservative Christian {{groups such}} as Family First New Zealand have {{questioned}} the low uptake of civil unions. LGBT organisations claim that this criticism is unfounded as there are fewer divorces after incompatible civil unions than with <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages,</b> particularly amongst Christians in the Southern US, who have displayed a higher than average divorce rate. This suggests that LGBT community members and heterosexuals who enter civil unions give more prior deliberation than those who enter <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R

25|$|LGBT {{members of}} the church are {{expected}} to keep the law of chastity. If they do, they can “go forward as do all other {{members of the}} church.” If they desire to enter into a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage,</b> they should first learn to deal with their homosexual feelings; otherwise, they must remain celibate. Gay or lesbian sex, in any form, whether the participants are married or not, may be grounds for excommunication.|$|E
40|$|Ada Leverson's The Little Ottley trilogy, which {{contains}} her novels Love's Shadows, Tenterhooks, and Love At Second Sight, exemplifies the transitions between Victorian/Edwardian gender ideologies and more modern ideologies. Rather than completely breaking with the past, Leverson engages with aspects {{of past and}} current gender ideologies to bridge these ideologies with developing, more modern gender ideologies. In Love's Shadows and Tenterhooks, Leverson exemplifies female sacrifice, {{a key element in}} Victorian gender logic, via three triangles of desire. In each triangle, a female must sacrifice to uphold 'happy endings,' including <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages</b> and male homosocial relationships. Furthermore, <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages</b> are maintained at the expense of female homosocial relationships whereas <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages</b> encourage male homosocial relationships. In Love At Second Sight, Leverson rewards her heroine by allowing her to become a modern, empowered woman, but only after the heroine repeatedly and successfully upholds her role as a proper, sacrificing Victorian/Edwardian woman...|$|R

25|$|Any type {{of sexual}} {{activity}} outside a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> is forbidden.

Transsexuals still report societal intolerance as in other societies around the world.|$|E
25|$|On 22 December 2014, a {{proposed}} {{amendment to the}} Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage,</b> effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children.|$|E
25|$|In various societies, many {{individuals}} exhibit homoerotic behaviour during certain stages of their life, notably during adolescence, and generally before their <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage,</b> possibly because that same-sex alliances {{are more important}} in one’s early life than later, when the concern for sexual reproduction comes into play, and individuals who engage in homoerotic acts obtain benefits applicable to their reproductive lives. Before that period of their life, same-sex alliances are important in aiding survival, and among the Q'eqchi' of Belize, significantly more children survive past six months for men with same-sex alliance due {{to the increase in}} productivity of agricultural labour.|$|E

50|$|Interpretation {{of these}} texts within Christian {{tradition}} vary. While much of scripture has served to promote chastity, celibacy, and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages</b> and denounce actions such as premarital sexual behavior and homosexuality, some denominations and groups including {{but not limited}} to Feminist, Queer, and Black Theologians have used these texts (and others) to further sex-positivity within a Christian context.|$|R
25|$|The rules let to the advise from {{lawyers to}} {{postpone}} transitioning {{in order to}} gain permanent residence based on marriage when the couples would be a same-sex couple after transitioning even when they have a valid <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage.</b> In 2012, this approach was challenged by a same-sex couple who got married in Texas in 2010 where they are considered a heterosexual couple under the ruling in Littleton v. Prange. Their petition was originally rejected by immigration, but in January 2013, in a non precedential decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the case back to USCIS with instructions to apply the rules set forth in In re Lovo-Lara, and determine whether the couple had a valid marriage under the laws of the State of Texas. The case was held up by USCIS until the US supreme court struck down Section 3 of DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of the FMA {{have claimed}} that life for those in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> are not {{materially}} affected by a constitutional marriage definition or legalization of same-sex marriage. They stated that the FMA was totally unnecessary because federal and state laws, combined {{with the state of}} the relevant constitutional doctrines at the time, already made court-ordered nationwide same-sex marriage unlikely for the foreseeable future. It was claimed therefore, that such an amendment was a solution in search of a problem. It was claimed that neither federal nor state courts were likely to order same-sex marriage under the traditional interpretation of the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause. Nor, for the foreseeable future, it was claimed, were courts likely to mandate same-sex marriage under substantive federal constitutional doctrines, such as the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. However, in light of the legalisation of same-sex marriage in several states since 2012, this claim is no longer true.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 after a {{landslide}} {{victory over the}} Conservative Party. Under the title of New Labour, he promised economic and social reform and brought Labour closer to {{the centre of the}} political spectrum. Early policies of the Blair government included the minimum wage and the introduction of university tuition fees. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown also gave the Bank of England the power to set the base rate of interest autonomously. The traditional tendency of governments to manipulate interest rates around the time of general elections for political gain is thought to have been deleterious to the UK economy and helped reinforce a cyclical pattern of boom and bust. Brown's decision was popular with the City, which the Labour Party had been courting since the early 1990s. Blair presided over the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century and his premiership saw large investment into social aspects, in particular health and education, areas particularly under-invested during the Conservative government of the 1980s and early 1990s. The Human Rights Act was introduced in 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act came into force in 2000. Most hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords in 1999 and the Civil Partnership Act of 2005 allowed homosexual couples the right to register their partnership with the same rights and responsibilities comparable to <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E

500|$|Using the {{theories}} of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay [...] "'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in Emma" [...] argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in Emma were a form of [...] "surveillance" [...] that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading {{her that she had}} to engage in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love.|$|E
500|$|The Socialist Party (PSOE) {{manifesto}} for the 2004 {{general election}} included {{the pledge of}} amending the Civil Code to legalize same-sex marriage, granting it the same status as <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> in order to [...] "ensure full social and legal equality for lesbians and gays". After the socialists' victory in the election, the new Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, promised at his inauguration address to bring this change forward: [...] "The moment has finally arrived to end {{once and for all}} the intolerable discrimination which many Spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences. (...) As a result, we will modify the Civil Code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects over inheritance, labor rights and social security protection". On 30 June 2004, then Minister of Justice Juan Fernando López Aguilar announced that the Congress of Deputies had provisionally approved a government plan for legislation to extend the right of marriage to same-sex couples. López Aguilar also announced two propositions, introduced by the regional Convergence and Union party of Catalonia: one introduced legal status for both opposite- and same-sex common-law unions (parejas de hecho, [...] "de facto unions"), while the other permitted transgender people to legally change their name and sex designation without the requirement of surgery. The bill regarding same-sex marriage was approved by the Cabinet on 1 October 2004, submitted to Parliament on 31 December, and passed by the Congress of Deputies on 21 April 2005. However, it was rejected on 22 June 2005 by the Senate, where the opposition People's Party held a plurality of the seats. The bill was returned to the lower house, which holds the power to override the Senate, and final approval was given to the bill on 30 June 2005 with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes, 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and 4 abstentions.|$|E

25|$|In many jurisdictions where {{same-sex}} couples can access civil unions or registered partnerships, these are often intended as parallel institutions {{to that of}} <b>heterosexual</b> monogamous <b>marriage.</b> Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, {{as in the case}} of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with more than one person. Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriages.</b> As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.|$|R

2500|$|A {{subset of}} heteronormativity {{is the concept}} of heteronormative temporality. This {{ideology}} states that the ultimate life goal for society is <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage.</b> Societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure. Heteronormative temporality promotes abstinence only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative, and teach their children accordingly. According to [...] Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around abstinence only practices in the United States, but this differs {{in other parts of the}} world. Similarly, George Washington University Professor Abby Wilkerson discusses the ways in which the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> in order to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of the {{constitutional}} amendment argued that exclusively <b>heterosexual</b> <b>marriage</b> was [...] "an essential institution of society", that leaving the constitution unchanged would [...] "result in public schools teaching our kids that gay marriage is okay", and that gay people [...] "do {{not have the right}} to redefine marriage for everyone else".|$|E
