A partial autopsy showed that the cancer had metastasized throughout <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body.</b> As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E

As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video show {{more of the same}} effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts walking out of the frame before the camera moves upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{one year}} later, on July 5, 1968, the {{partially}} decomposed, mutilated {{body of a}} 20-year-old art student named Joan Elspeth Schell was found by construction workers on an Ann Arbor roadside. She had been raped, then stabbed 25 times with a knife estimated to have measured four inches in length. Several of these wounds had punctured her lungs, liver and carotid artery, with one additional wound inflicted behind her left ear fracturing her skull. In addition, her throat had been slashed, and her miniskirt then tied around her neck. Although Schell {{had been dead for}} several days, <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> lower <b>body</b> was in a remarkably preserved condition, whereas her head, shoulders and breasts were in an advanced state of decomposition, leading the pathologist to conclude her body had been stored in a naturally cool environment, but with the upper third of her body exposed to natural heat.|$|R
500|$|Music critics {{received}} [...] "Cocoon" [...] {{with positive}} reviews, calling {{it one of}} the album's best moments. The song experienced moderate commercial success in record charts in the United Kingdom, Australia, and France, but reached the top 10 in Spain. The accompanying music video for [...] "Cocoon" [...] was directed by Eiko Ishioka and was shot in New York City. It premiered at Raindance Film Festival in October 2001, and was made available online through the singer's official website in February 2002, closer to the song's release as a single. It depicts Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> bleached nude <b>body.</b> The video was considered inappropriate and was banned from prime-time MTV following her music video for [...] "Pagan Poetry". Björk promoted the song by performing on the Vespertine World Tour and several TV and radio shows.|$|R

The three help to defend the {{resident}} merfolk city from pox-infected pirates; in return, the merfolk summon sea creatures to assist Guybrush in locating La Esponja Grande. Elaine stays behind to monitor LeChuck's actions. As Guybrush follows the creatures on the Screaming Narwhal, Morgan again boards the ship; de Singe had informed <b>her</b> that Guybrush's <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> was needed. Distracted by their duel, neither can react in time when the Screaming Narwhal is swallowed whole by a giant manatee. Inside the manatee, Guybrush and LeFlay discover the crazed DeCava and his crew; Guybrush heals the manatee's injuries, and escapes with DeCava to the location of La Esponja Grande (which turns out to be much smaller than advertised). After retrieving La Esponja Grande, Morgan knocks Guybrush unconscious and sets sail for Flotsam Island with her bounty.|$|R
25|$|Experiments with P. h. humanus (body lice) {{emphasize}} the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with {{six or more}} males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> was tinged with red—a condition attributed to rupture of the alimentary canal during the sexual act.

500|$|An {{extremely}} strong mutant telepath who {{can also}} change <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> into hard diamond form which grants her superhuman strength, stamina, psionic immunity, and durability, {{at the cost}} of using her telepathic abilities. She {{is a member of the}} Hellfire Club. Prior to Jones' casting, Alice Eve was the subject of what Variety called [...] "widespread Internet reports" [...] that Eve [...] "was set to play Emma Frost, although no deal was in place." [...] Jones accepted the role to get something different from her job in the TV series Mad Men. While discovering that like the show First Class was set in the 1960s, the actress considered that: [...] "'s so, so far from Betty and from Mad Men, and it takes place in that time but it doesn’t feel like a period movie." [...] The actress described the revealing costumes of the character as [...] "insane," [...] saying, [...] "She's got quite the bod, which is very intimidating". The actress stated that she did only a limited exercise routine to keep in shape, as [...] "I'm a petite person, so I didn't want to go into a strict workout and eating regime." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} her third {{trimester}} {{was involved in a}} motor vehicle accident, and died; the non-viable fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact [...] The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators {{came to the conclusion that}} the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body,</b> the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E

[...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but <b>her</b> <b>entire</b> <b>body</b> rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others.
