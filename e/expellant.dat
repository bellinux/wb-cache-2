25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the <b>expellant</b> is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the <b>expellant</b> gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, dry chemical (classes ABC and B.C.), and dry powder (class D) types {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the HC in the electron collection mode is called the plasma contacting (or ignited) operating mode. The “ignited mode” is so termed because it indicates that multi-ampere current levels {{can be achieved by}} using the voltage drop at the plasma contactor. This accelerates space plasma electrons which ionize neutral <b>expellant</b> flow from the contactor. If electron collection currents are high and/or ambient electron densities are low, the sheath at which electron current collection is sustained simply expands or shrinks until the required current is collected.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{alternative}} to magnetic confinement is inertial confinement fusion (ICF), {{such as that}} proposed by Project Daedalus. A small pellet of fusion fuel (with a diameter {{of a couple of}} millimeters) would be ignited by an electron beam or a laser. To produce direct thrust, a magnetic field would form the pusher plate. In principle, the Helium-3-Deuterium reaction or an aneutronic fusion reaction could be used to maximize the energy in charged particles and to minimize radiation, but it is highly questionable whether it is technically feasible to use these reactions. Both the detailed design studies in the 1970s, the Orion drive and Project Daedalus, used inertial confinement. In the 1980s, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA studied an ICF-powered [...] "Vehicle for Interplanetary Transport Applications" [...] (VISTA). The conical VISTA spacecraft could deliver a 100-tonne payload to Mars orbit and return to Earth in 130 days, or to Jupiter orbit and back in 403 days. 41 tonnes of deuterium/tritium (D-T) fusion fuel would be required, plus 4,124 tonnes of hydrogen <b>expellant.</b> The exhaust velocity would be 157 km/s.|$|E

40|$|The author made {{comparative}} {{studies of the}} effects of different kinds of oil, insecticide, and disinfectant on the development of mosquito larvae or chrysalises. He found from the experiments that the effects of oil increase in proportion to the thickness of the oil sheet on the water, that the effects of insecticide or disinfectant depend upon the concentration of the medical solution, and that, if subjected to insecticide and disinfectant, the chrysalis has stronger resistance than the larva, but that, on the contrary, the chrysalis has the weaker resistance when exposed to oil. He further established the fact that the light and the heavy oils, which were hitherto generally used, are relatively cheap and moreover the most effective <b>expellants</b> among the many tested. He showed also that {{it is very difficult to}} exterminate with oil the innumerable developed larvae and chrysalises in drains in summer, but that oil is very effective in destroying those larvae which pass the winter. Therefore he maintained that the extermination of larvae and chrysalises is to be carried on in winter. Next he experimented concerning the effects on mosquito development of the following eight species of water plants: 1) Potamogeton oxyphyllus, Miq. 2) Potamogeton crispus, L. 3) Hydrilla verticillata, Casp. var. Roxburghii, Casp. 4) Trapa natans, L. var. bispinosa, Makino. 5) Lemna paucicostata, Hegelm. 6) Spirendera polyrhiza, Schleid. 7) Hydrocharis asiatika, Miq. 8) Potamogeton Polygonifoius, pourr. The experiments clearly indicate that these species have a marked effect on the development of the mosquito. In his research as to the cause of this effect, the water plants in the dark room had no effect on the development of the larva; it began to decay, and no further work could be undertaken. This single experiment, in connection with other works, would indicate that the larvicidal action of the water plants is associated with the excessive production of oxygen caused by photosynthetic activity...|$|R
40|$|A hollow cathode-based plasma {{contactor}} is baselined on International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) for spacecraft charge control. The plasma contactor system {{consists of}} a hollow cathode assembly (HCA), a power electronics unit (PEU), and an <b>expellant</b> management unit (EMU). The plasma contactor has recently been required to operate in a cyclic mode to conserve xenon <b>expellant</b> and extend system life. Originally, a DC cathode heater converter was baselined for a continuous operation mode because only a few ignitions of the hollow cathode were expected. However, for cyclic operation, a DC heater supply can potentially result in hollow cathode heater component failure due to the DC electrostatic field. This can prevent the heater from attaining the proper cathode tip temperature for reliable ignition of the hollow cathode. To mitigate this problem, an AC cathode heater supply was therefore designed, fabricated, and installed into a modified PEU. The PEU was tested using resistive loads and then integrated with an engineering model hollow cathode to demonstrate stable steady-state operation. Integration {{issues such as the}} effect of line and load impedance on the output of the AC cathode heater supply and the characterization of the temperature profile of the heater under AC excitation were investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{electron}} collection and emission {{characteristics of a}} simple hollow cathode contactor, an extended anode hollow cathode contactor supplied by JSC, and a ring cusp magnetic field contactor are presented {{and the effects of}} discharge power and argon or xenon <b>expellant</b> flowrate on these characteristics are examined. All of the contactors are shown to exhibit good electron emission performance over a wide range of discharge power and <b>expellant</b> type and flowrate. Good electron performance is shown to be more difficult to achieve. Results suggest that the extended anode and ring cusp contactors should perform satisfactorily to electron emission currents beyond 1000 mA and {{electron collection}} currents beyond 500 mA. All contactors performed better on xenon than argon. A general theory of plasma contactor operation in both the electron collection and electron emission modes, which describes the current-limiting effects of space-charge phenomena is given. This current-limiting and collecting phenomenon is shown to be a function of driving potential differences and emitting and collecting surface radius ratio for the case of a spherical geometry. Discharge power did not appear to influence the electron collection current substantially in the experiments so it is suggested in light of the model that the contactors are generally not limited by their ion production capabilities under conditions at which they were tested...|$|E

40|$|The role {{earthworms}} play in {{soil fertility}} is under increasing scientific scrutiny, {{especially in light}} of the fact that farmers are seeking to reduce soil tillage. However, there are many discrepancies in earthworm sampling methods. The aim of this study is to compare the efficiency of three chemical expellants (formaldehyde, commercial ‘hot’ mustard and allyl isothiocyanate, abbreviated AITC), with two sampling methods: (i) a simple method that consisted in spreading an <b>expellant</b> solution on the soil and retrieving earthworms that emerged at the soil surface, and (ii) a combined method that consisted in applying a chemical to expel earthworms and then hand-sorting the remaining earthworms from the block of soil. Sampling efficiency was measured in terms of earthworm density and biomass, for endogeic and anecic earthworms. With the simple method, a higher density of earthworms was sampled using formaldehyde and AITC than with mustard. Formaldehyde, AITC and mustard expelled not significantly different biomasses of 47. 7, 31. 9 and 20. 5 g m− 2, respectively, on average over the three plots. The combined method did not yield a significantly different density or biomass with the different chemicals. Formaldehyde is toxic and commercial ‘hot’ mustard is difficult to standardise and inefficient when used without hand-sorting. Accounting for the accuracy of the sampling methods as well as the toxicity of the chemicals to users and soil organisms, AITC appears to be a reliable and promising chemical <b>expellant</b> whether or not in combination with hand-sorting. Its use would be a step towards standardizing earthworm sampling methods...|$|E

A theory is presented of the interaction between the contactor plasma and the background plasma. The conditions for formation of a double layer between the two plasmas are derived.

Expellant-less neutralizers can improve the viability of very low-power colloid thrusters, field emission electric propulsion devices, ion engines, Hall thrusters, and gridded vacuum arc thrusters.

The experimental data obtained are typically examined in the frequency domain (i. e. amplitudes of the noise fluctuations versus frequency).

40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, plasma contactors {{are observed}} to collect ampere-level electron currents with low impedance. In order {{to extend the}} laboratory experience to the low-earth-orbit environment, a model of plasma contactors is being developed. Laboratory results {{are being used to}} support and validate the model development. The important physical processes observed in the laboratory are that the source plasma is separated from the background plasma by a double layer and that ionization of the <b>expellant</b> gas by the collected electrons creates the bulk of the ions that leave the source plasma. The model, which uses Poisson's equation with a physical charge density that includes the ion and electron components of both the source and the ambient plasmas, reproduces this phenomenon for typical experimental parameters. The calculations, in agreement with the laboratory results, show little convergence of the accelerated electrons. The angular momentum of the incoming electrons dramatically reduces the peak electron density. These electrons ionize enough gas to generate the source plasma. Calculations show that the increase in ionization rate with potential produces a steep rise in collected current with increasing potential as seen in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|A {{hollow cathode}} plasma {{contactor}} has been baselined as a charge control device for the Space Station (SS) to prevent deleterious interactions of coated structural components with the ambient plasma. NASA LeRC Work Package 4 initiated {{the development of}} a plasma contactor system comprised of a Power Electronics Unit (PEU), an <b>Expellant</b> Management Unit (EMU), a command and data interface, and a Plasma Contactor Unit (PCU). A breadboard PEU was designed and fabricated. The breadboard PEU contains a cathode heater and discharge power supply, which were required to operate the PCU, a control and auxiliary power converter, an EMU interface, a command and telemetry interface, and a controller. The cathode heater and discharge supplies utilized a push-pull topology with a switching frequency of 20 kHz and pulse-width-modulated (PWM) control. A pulse ignition circuit derived from that used in arcjet power processors was incorporated in the discharge supply for discharge ignition. An 8088 based microcontroller was utilized in the breadboard model to provide a flexible platform for controller development with a simple command/data interface incorporating a direct connection to SS Mulitplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM) analog and digital I/O cards.

40|$|International audienceEarthworms are target organisms {{both for}} {{scientists}} studying the biological component of soils and for farmers concerned with monitoring {{the quality of}} their soils. Different expellants are used to extract earthworms from the soil but differences in chemical properties and efficiency between commercial mustard and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) solutions remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to compare (i) the concentration of irritating product (allyl isothiocyanate AITC) in two <b>expellant</b> solutions (diluted mustard or AITC solution) and (ii) their efficiency in extracting earthworms from the soil. AITC concentration was analyzed according to a new method, based on AITC solvent extraction and HPLC quantification, in one commercial mustard brand to assess its variability within and between batches of jars. According to mustard spiking with AITC standard solution, extraction recovery was estimated as 98 ± 2 %. Earthworm field data were collected in spring 2012 in 22 cultivated fields located in east Île-de-France, comparing pure AITC to commercial mustard solutions. Species diversity, abundance and biomass of earthworms per plot were measured. We showed that AITC concentration in commercial mustard varied according to the use by date but not according to the batch. We thus recommend using the freshest mustard available from the same batch. Moreover, AITC solution was found to be about four times more concentrated in AITC than the commercial mustard solution.

40|$|Avec les remerciements pour Nathalie Cheviron et Virginie GrondinAlternative {{cropping}} {{systems have been}} proposed to enhance sustainability of agriculture, but their mid and long-term effects on soil biodiversity should be studied more carefully. Earthworms, having important agro-ecological functions, are regarded as indicators of soil biological health. Species composition, abundance, and biomasses of earthworms were measured in autumn 2005 – 2007 (period 1) and 2011 – 2013 (period 2) in a trial initiated in 1997 near Paris, France. A conventional, an organic and a direct seeded living mulch-based {{cropping systems}} were compared. Earthworms were sampled in a wheat crop by combining {{the application of a}} chemical <b>expellant</b> and hand-sorting. In period 1, earthworm abundance did not usually differ in the three cropping systems, but sometimes it was higher in the conventional system. Mean total abundance was 122, 121 and 149 individuals m− 2 in period 1 and 408, 386 and 216 in period 2 in the organic, living mulch and conventional systems respectively. While earthworm abundance and biomass increased slightly in the conventional system between the two periods, they at least tripled in the other two systems. This was mainly due to the species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodealonga in the living mulch cropping system, and to A. caliginosa,Lumbricus castaneus, Lumbricus terrestris and A. longa in the organic system. After at least 14 years, organic and living mulch cropping systems contained between 1. 5 and 2. 3 times more earthworms than the conventional system. Considering the inter-annual variations in earthworm communities due to climatic conditions and cultural practices, earthworm communities should be assessed over several years before conclusions can be drawn. Moreover, since changes in cultural practices may {{take a long time to}} affect earthworm communities, mid and long-term trials are needed to assess the effects of cropping systems on soil biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{well-known}} role of earthworms in the functioning {{and health of}} soils and whole ecosystems, feasible and reliable studies of their abundance and diversity in agricultural lands are essential for the effective design of best agricultural practices. However, previous work {{has shown that the}} extraction efficiency of different methods proposed seems to depend on species and size of earthworms and presumably on soil type, which makes creating an earthworm inventory difficult. In the present study, we compare the efficiency of five earthworm extraction methods combining hand-sorting with chemical expellants (hand-sorting, formalin, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), formalin + hand-sorting and AITC + hand-sorting) over a wide range of soil properties (depth, texture and water regime) in cultivated and semi-natural habitats found in a Mediterranean region (CW-Spain). Sampling efficacy was measured in terms of number of earthworms extracted, taking into account different species, ecological groups, development stages, size of individuals, and soil properties. We found 20 species, only 6 endogeic and 1 anecic species being abundant. The anecic Aporrectodea trapezoides responded reasonably to chemical expellants, as did certain soil surface dwelling endogeic species (Microscolex phosphoreus and Microscolex dubius), with above 50 % of specimens of these species sampled after chemical application. For other endogeic species, such as Allolobophora molleri and Aporrectodea rosea, chemical expellants gave poor results (< 15 % and 5 % of specimens, respectively), and combined methods produced similar results to hand-sorting alone. Hand-sorting appears necessary for sampling the total earthworm community in particular for endogeic species, but when only species richness is of interest, the application of a chemical <b>expellant</b> can be a time-efficient method. Response to different methods was irrespective of the earthworm size within species, but depended on the maturity stage of the specimens, habitat type and soil properties, making difficult the adoption of a simple sampling protocol for large surveys in highly fragmented Mediterranean earthworm communities...|$|E
