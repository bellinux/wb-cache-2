40|$|Plasma in a bag" {{stands for}} a new {{low-cost}} technique for coating the inside of closed plastic bags by means of atmospheric pressure plasma. The technique allows the deposition of homogeneous, long-term stable functional layers on the inner surfaces of cell culture bags. The area density of functional amino groups was determined by chemical derivatization in combination with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. A prototype of an equipment was built for the automated and reproducible deposition of coatings under standard laboratory conditions maintaining the sterility of the bag. High yields of adherent grown human mesenchymal stem cells can be achieved even after long periods of storage of the bag before use. With suitable variation of the <b>film-forming</b> <b>agent</b> different functionalities can be obtained on the surface.

40|$|Welan gum {{is a kind}} {{of novel}} {{microbial}} polysaccharide, which is widely produced during the process of microbial growth and metabolism in different external conditions. Welan gum can be used as the thickener, suspending agent, emulsifier, stabilizer, lubricant, <b>film-forming</b> <b>agent</b> and adhesive usage in agriculture. In recent years, finding optimal experimental conditions to maximize the production is paid growing attentions. In this work, a hybrid computational method is proposed to optimize experimental conditions for producing Welan gum with data collected from experiments records. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to model the relationship between Welan gum production and experimental conditions, and then adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA, for short) is applied to search optimized experimental conditions. As results, a mathematic model of predicting production of Welan gum from experimental conditions is obtained, which achieves accuracy rate 88. 36 %.

40|$|According to the {{practice}} of making concrete products, which steaming was realized in thermoshaping machines, concretes of such products are notable for their defective structure. An unevenness of the thermal field in the concrete when warming-up it by contact method causes migration of free moisture, as a result, there is a process of hydraulic and thermal conductivity on which the moisture transfer {{under the influence of the}} pressure gradient in hardening concrete superimposes. Recently study on the removal of this defect by covering with film-forming materials the products’ surfaces free at worming from the formwork. In this paper specimen K- 9 of a water-soluble polymer representing waste products of nitrogen is considered. Results of natural experiments devoted to exploring the influence of <b>film-forming</b> <b>agent</b> on durability of cement concrete products with their subsequent operation under the impact of rigorous climate are shown.

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} the systematic design {{and development of}} low-damage drilling fluid to protect the low-permeability gas reservoir of the Sulige block in the Ordos Basin, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Based on investigation of the geological characteristics and the potential formation damage of the Permian formation of the reservoir, waterblocking due to invasion of drilling or completion fluids was identified {{one of the most}} severe causes of damage to gas well deliverability. By adopting the phase trap prevention method, ideal packing theory, and film-forming technology, a low-damage drilling fluid, sodium formate brine containing efficient waterblocking preventing surfactants, optimized temporary bridging <b>agents</b> (TBAs), and <b>film-forming</b> <b>agents</b> has been developed. The performance of the new drilling fluid was evaluated by using a variety of techniques. The results show that the fluid has good rheological properties, good strong shale-swelling inhibition, good temporary plugging effect, ultra-low filtration, and good lubricity. It can efficiently minimize waterblocking and can be used to drill horizontal wells with minimal intervention of the reservoir in the Sulige Gas Field.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the hair damage due to hair straightening process, post-treatment is recommended {{to protect the}} damaged hair from further depreciation and breakage. However, few reported quantitatively {{about the effectiveness of}} post-treatment after hair straightening process. Therefore, the aim of this paper will investigate the effectiveness of post-treatment methods for chemically straightened hairs. The effectiveness will be evaluated through different analytical methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry, tensile strength test and urea bisulphite solubility test for the properties related to morphological structure, hair colour change, tensile strength as well as chemical damage respectively. From the findings of the instrumental results, it was obvious that the application of post-treatments would improve the lustre of the damaged hair by giving higher value in lightness when compared with the raw hair control sample. Furthermore, the strength property of the post-treated hair increased when compared with the chemically straightened hair.

40|$|Background. Xyloglucan, a <b>film-forming</b> <b>agent,</b> {{improves}} {{intestinal mucosa}} resistance to pathologic damage. The efficacy, safety, {{and time of}} onset of the antidiarrheal effect of xyloglucan were assessed in children with acute gastroenteritis receiving oral rehydration solution (ORS). Methods. This randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, clinical trial included children (3 months– 12 years) with acute gastroenteritis of infectious origin. Children were randomized to xyloglucan and ORS, or ORS only, for 5 days. Diarrheal symptoms, including stool number/characteristics, and safety were assessed at baseline and after 2 and 5 days and by fulfillment of a parent diary card. Results. Thirty-six patients (58. 33 % girls) were included (n= 18 /group). Patients receiving xyloglucan and ORS had better symptom evolution than ORS-only recipients, with a faster onset of action. At 6 hours, xyloglucan produced a significantly greater {{decrease in the number}} of type 7 stools (0. 11 versus 0. 44; P= 0. 027). At days 3 and 5, xyloglucan also produced a significantly greater reduction in types 6 and 7 stools compared with ORS alone. Xyloglucan plus ORS was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions. Xyloglucan is an efficacious and safe option for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children, with a rapid onset of action in reducing diarrheal symptoms.

40|$|Commercial {{antimycotic}} nail lacquers {{are commonly}} based on water-insoluble resins. The {{present study was}} aimed at evaluating a novel. experimental nail lacquer (P- 3051, Polichem SA, Lugano, Switzerland) based on the water-soluble <b>film-forming</b> <b>agent</b> hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH). The in vitro permeation of ciclopirox (CPX) from P- 3051 and from a commercial, water-insoluble lacquer based on a vinyl resin (Penlac(TM) Aven is Pharma), was investigated using thin membranes obtained from bovine hooves, an accepted model for human nails. Similar CPX permeation fluxes at steady state through the membranes, but significantly different lag times were observed for P- 3051 and Penlac(TM), when these were tested as dry films. The formulations thus appeared to influence only the time required by CPX to saturate the membrane, and not the final drug concentration gradient in the membrane. Permeation experiments performed on the same membranes and on hairless mouse skin with P- 3051 and with a similar, HPCH-free vehicle (ERV), both tested in liquid form, disproved the possibility that HPCH might act as a permeation enhancer for CPX in either substrate. The possible reasons for the greater efficiency of the HPCH vehicle in terms of CPX transfer from the vehicle itself to the keratin membrane are discussed. This effect might be tentatively attributed to a particular affinity of HPCH for the membrane, resulting in intimate contact and strong adhesion of the HPCH lacquer to the keratin substrate...|$|E

Mouth dissolving dosage forms are gaining popularity in recent times, as these dosage forms requires no water for administration. Rofecoxib, a NSAID widely used {{in the management of}} osteoarthritis and dental pain. Being water insoluble drug, the onset of absorption and pharmacological action depends mainly on its dissolution. The aim of the present work was to formulate and evaluate mouth-dissolving film containing Rofecoxib. Films were formulated using HPMC- 15 cps and polyvinyl alcohol as two different <b>film-forming</b> <b>agents.</b> Rofecoxib was dispersed in the polymer solution. Films were prepared by casting method and found to satisfy the mouth dissolving time and other film parameters. Film instantly get wet by saliva, rapidly hydrates, adheres to tongue and rapidly disintegrates and dissolves to release the drug for the oral mucosal absorption or allow for gastrointestinal absorption to be achieved when swallowed. The formulated films exhibited acceptable film endurance. Time required for the film to dissolve and release the drug was found to be 30 seconds and 1 minute respectively. It can be concluded from the study that the mouth dissolving film can be a potential novel drug dosage form for poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|R

The novel film former, lycoat NG 73 (granular hydroxypropyl starch), along with different <b>film-forming</b> <b>agents</b> (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and polyvinyl alcohol), in addition to three film modifiers; namely, maltodextrin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 90 and lycoat RS 780 (pregelatinized hydroxypropyl starch) were evaluated. Eight formulae were prepared by the solvent-casting method; and were evaluated for their in vitro dissolution characteristics, in vitro disintegration time, and their physico-mechanical properties. The promising orodispersible film based on lycoat NG 73 (F 1); showing the greatest drug dissolution, satisfactory in vitro disintegration time and physico-mechanical properties that are suitable for orodispersible films, was evaluated for its bioavailability compared with a reference marketed product (Stablon® tablets) in rabbits.

However, a successful cultivation {{of this type of}} cells is only possible under very specific conditions. Of great importance, for instance, are the absence of contaminants such as foreign microbiological organisms, i. e., sterility, and the chemical functionalization of the ground on which the cells are grown. As cultivation of these cells makes high demands, a new procedure for cell cultivation has been developed in which closed plastic bags are used. For adherent cell growth chemical functional groups have to be introduced on the inner surface of the plastic bag. This can be achieved by a new, atmospheric-pressure plasma-based method presented in this paper. The method which was developed jointly by the Fraunhofer IST and the Helmholtz HZI can be implemented in automated equipment as is also shown in this contribution. Plasma process gases used include helium or helium-based gas mixtures (He + N + H) and vapors of suitable <b>film-forming</b> <b>agents</b> or precursors such as APTMS, DACH, and TMOS in helium. The effect of plasma treatment is investigated by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy as well as surface tension determination based on contact angle measurements and XPS. Plasma treatment in nominally pure helium increases the surface tension of the polymer foil due to the presence of oxygen traces in the gas and oxygen diffusing through the gas-permeable foil, respectively, reacting with surface radical centers formed during contact with the discharge. Primary amino groups are obtained on the inner surface by treatment in mixtures with nitrogen and hydrogen albeit their amount is comparably small due to diffusion of oxygen through the gas-permeable bag, interfering with the plasma-amination process.
