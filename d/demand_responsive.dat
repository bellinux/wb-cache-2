The service was funded and coordinated by Nexus, the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive. The service replaced the smaller scale U-Call which replaced the yet smaller Western Links. The service carried the tag line [...] "Phone up and go" [...] which {{was included in}} the LinkUp livery. [...] The service was closed in 2011 due to the relatively high subsidy per journey, with funding moved to conventional bus routes following a public consultation.

This is expressed through parameter ω_i^t, where low values of ω_i^t correspond to elastic <b>demand</b> (very <b>responsive</b> to price), whereas higher values of ω_i^t correspond to inelastic <b>demand</b> (less <b>responsive</b> to price). The dependence of ω_i^t on i and t captures the fact that different users, at different times, value consumption differently.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The active demand-side {{response}} in electricity market would produce benefits {{not only for}} individual consumers {{but also for the}} market as a whole. This paper proposes a method i. e. price <b>responsive</b> <b>demand</b> shift bidding of distribution companies to reduce congestion and peak locational marginal prices in the pool-based dayahead electricity markets. The market dispatch problem is formulated as to maximize the social welfare of market participants subject to operational security constraints. This bidding mechanism is able to shift the price <b>responsive</b> <b>demand</b> from the periods of high price to the periods of low price in day-ahead electricity markets. The comparison of the price <b>responsive</b> <b>demand</b> shifting bids with conventional price taking bids is presented by solving hourly market dispatch problems on an IEEE 30 -bus system for 24 -h scheduling period. The effects of the proportion of demand-side participation on the price taking and price responsive consumer are also illustrated.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{renewables}} is significantly {{affected by the}}ir penetration, concentration and location. Value is further affected by the responsiveness of demand which will {{reduce the need for}} back up power through non-renewable sources. By increasing the penetration of renewables in power systems, demand side participation become more important. Demand Side Management (DSM) programs have been studied {{for a long time and}} among all DSM programs <b>Responsive</b> <b>Demand</b> seems to be the most applicable type of DSM for a system with significant intermittent generation. It mitigates issues such as required reserve, network congestions and higher/lower voltage profiles and thus results in less operation cost although little attention has been made to quantify the benefits of <b>responsive</b> <b>demand.</b> In this paper, the value of wind generation without <b>responsive</b> <b>demand</b> is quantified first, by introducing responsiveness in the demand side, the reduction in operation cost is calculated and the additional benefits are quantified. The quantification was evaluated on the IEEE 30 busbar system through Security Constraint Unit Commitment (SCUC) and the results indicate the benefits of <b>responsive</b> <b>demand</b> on operational and environmental characteristics in power system...|$|R

Staged Server Design might be the answer to the problem of supporting millions of users <b>demanding</b> <b>responsive</b> and always available services. This architecture tries to substitute the thread-based model, commonly used in network applications, by dividing computation into stages. This paper covers this new software architecture presenting in detail two different approaches both based on staged computation: SEDA (staged event-driven architecture) [10] and StagedServer[7]. We describe the design of both solutions and their implementations. And we also present different applications to show how they perform. The results show that both solutions exhibit higher performance than traditional service designs. Based on these two solutions, we finally include two case studies: Staged DBMSs and Adaptive overload control; that demonstrate how to take advantage of staged server principles...|$|R

Based on this review of RTP program experience, we identify key trends related to: utilities motivations for implementing RTP, evolution of RTP tariff design, program participation, participant price response, and program outlook. We draw from these findings to discuss implications for policymakers that are currently considering voluntary RTP as a strategy for developing price <b>responsive</b> <b>demand...</b>|$|R
