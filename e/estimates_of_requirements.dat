40|$|Simultaneously {{satisfying}} multiple interacting {{and possibly}} conflicting software requirements is challenging.

The optimum alternative is decided by using a heuristic method, which may need to consult with domain experts.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of dose-response evidence relevant for estimating vitamin B 12 requirements of healthy adults and elderly people, considering different indicators of health: vitamin B 12 body stores, cognitive function, bone health, and biomarkers of vitamin B 12 status. Vitamin B 12 intakes needed to compensate daily losses may range from 3. 8 to 20. 7 μg/day depending on the assumptions used. The current evidence-base on cognitive function and bone health is too limited to estimate vitamin B 12 requirements. Evidence from controlled trials and observational studies on vitamin B 12 intake and biomarkers of vitamin B 12 status provided estimates of average requirements between 0. 07 and 4. 1 μg/day, {{depending on the type of}} data and selected cut-off value indicating adequate vitamin B 12 status.

40|$|Aims: To (i) {{identify}} {{current practice}} of dietitians in determining energy and protein requirements {{for patients with}} Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD); and (ii) explore the magnitude and implications of the variability in estimates with reference to typical patients at each stage of PAD. Methods: An invitation to complete an online 26 -item questionnaire was distributed electronically by the Dietitians Association of Australia to all members. Each method used by participants for estimation of energy and protein requirements across the stages of PAD {{was applied to the}} relevant typical patient and the range of estimates reported. Results: Twenty-two dietitians completed the questionnaire and reported caseloads inclusive of all stages of PAD and with relatively equal frequency. For estimation of energy requirements, the Schofield equations in addition to 120 - 125 kJ/kg and 125 - 145 kJ/kg were most frequently used. When applied to the typical patient, the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> varied by over 5000 kJ/day within each stage of PAD. For estimation of protein requirements it was common to apply the RDI (0. 8 - 1 g/kg/day) or account for minor surgery or sepsis (up to 1. 5 g/kg/day) for patients with rest pain or tissue loss. The estimates of protein requirements varied by up to 55 g/day depending on the method used. Conclusions: There was significant variation in energy and protein estimates both within and across the stages of PAD, which is possibly due to the little evidence available to inform dietitians on how to best treat patients with PAD. Further work is required to acquire a solid evidence base and subsequently communicate this for translation into practice. "...|$|E

40|$|In August 1965, {{a report}} {{entitled}} "World Uranium and Thorium Resources" {{was published by}} the European Nuclear Energy Agency, {{on the basis of}} an examination carried out by the ENEA Study Group on the Long-Term Role of Nuclear Energy in Western Europe. It was foreseen at the time of publication that the results of this examination would need to be updated at intervals, and in December 1967 a second report, "Uranium Resources, Revised Estimates" was published. In order to enlarge the geographical coverage of the study, and to receive the advice of experts from uranium-producing countries outside the OECD area, this revision was made jointly with the International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna. During 1968 a joint ENEA/IAEA Working Party prepared a first report on "Uranium Production and Short Term Demand", in an attempt to relate information on uranium production supplied by the members of the Working Party, with a prediction of the probable demand over the next ten years. The report was published in January 1969. In September 1970 a report on "Uranium Resources, Production and Demand" was published jointly by ENEA and the IAEA. This report contained an updating of the uranium resources position since 1967 which was again carried out by the joint ENEA/IAEA Working Party on Uranium Resources. In addition, the Secretariat had prepared estimates of uranium and separative work requirements which were annexed to the report. The present report is essentially similar to the previous one, in that it contains updated information on uranium resources, production and demand. Part II on Uranium Resources and Production was prepared in the framework of the joint NEA*/IAEA Working Party on Uranium Resources, {{as was the case in}} the three foregoing reports* The <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> for natural and enriched uranium, contained in Part III of the Report, have been prepared by a "Working Party on Uranium Demand", with an international membership set up for this purpose in spring 1972 by the NEA Study Group on the Long-Term Role of Nuclear Energy. As a result of this approach the estimates for uranium and separative work demand are based on corporately agreed input data, and the scope of the demand calculations has been extended considerably through access to relevant computer programs in several participating countries. 141 pages, graphiques, tableau...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of local {{resources for the}} construction and operation of a lunar base can significantly {{reduce the cost of}} transporting materials and supplies from Earth. The feasibility of processing lunar regolith to form construction materials and structural components is investigated. A preliminary review of potential processing methods such as sintering, hot-pressing, liquification, and cast basalt techniques, was completed. The processing method proposed is a variation on the cast basalt technique. It involves liquification of the regolith at 1200 - 1300 C, casting the liquid into a form, and controlled cooling. While the process temperature is higher than that for sintering or hot-pressing (1000 - 1100 C), this method is expected to yield a true engineering material with low variability in properties, high strength, and the potential to form large structural components. A scenario for this processing method was integrated with a design for a representative lunar base structure and potential construction techniques. The lunar shelter design is for a modular, segmented, pressurized, hemispherical dome which could serve as habitation and laboratory space. Based on this design, <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> for power, processing equipment, and construction equipment were made. This proposed combination of material processing method, structural design, and support requirements will help to establish the feasibility of lunar base construction using indigenous materials. Future work will refine the steps of the processing method. Specific areas where more information is needed are: furnace characteristics in vacuum; heat transfer during liquification; viscosity, pouring and forming behavior of molten regolith; design of high temperature forms; heat transfer during cooling; recrystallization of basalt; and refinement of estimates of elastic moduli, compressive and tensile strength, thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity. The preliminary design of the lunar shelter showed us that joining is a critical technology needed for building a structure from large segments. The problem of joining is important to the design of any structure that is not completely prefabricated. It is especially important when the structure is subjected to tensile loading by an internal pressure. For a lunar shelter constructed from large segments the joints between these large segments must be strong, and they must permit automated construction. With a cast basalt building material which is brittle, there is the additional problem of connecting the joint with the material and avoiding stress concentration that would cause failure. Thus, a well-defined project which we intend to pursue during this coming year is the design of joints for cast basalt structural elements...|$|E

One group of turkeys was fed to 3 wk using nutritionally adequate diets and fed test diets from 3 to 6 wk; another group of turkeys was fed to 6 wk using nutritionally adequate diets and fed test diets from 6 to 9 wk. Test diets were composed of peanut meal, soybean meal, corn, and grain sorghum as intact protein sources and were supplemented with amino acids. Peak performance of turkeys fed the test diets was equivalent to that of turkeys fed conventional corn-soybean meal diets for-mulated to meet NRC (1994) standards. <b>Estimates</b> <b>of</b> Thr <b>requirements</b> for weight gain were 0. 92 and 0. 86 % for 3 to 6 and 6 to 9 wk, respectively.
