A family therapy or systemic therapy approach is not concerned with diagnoses but seeks to understand the problem in terms of relationships and communication patterns. The systemic tradition is suspicious of the objectivity of medical assessment, sees the individual's account as a subjective narrative, and sees diagnosis as a socially constructed phenomenon. From a solution focused perspective, the assessment deliberately avoids <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> and seeks to elicit strengths and solutions.|$|E

Milk samples from 10 herds with Staph. aureus GTB herd problems (PH cases) were compared with samples from 19 herds with at least one Staph. aureus isolate of non-B genotype (CH cases). All samples were bacteriologically analysed and Staph. aureus genotyping carried out using a ribosomal spacer-PCR. Cow and quarter prevalences of Staph. aureus, CNS and Streptococcus spp. differed significantly between PH and CH groups. PH cases were highly associated with decreased cow prevalences of CNS and Streptococcus spp. These altered prevalences also contributed significantly to the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> herds without resorting to genotyping.

50|$|Human-in-the-loop or HITL {{is defined}} as a model that {{requires}} human interaction. HITL is associated with modeling and simulation (M&S) in the live, virtual, and constructive taxonomy.

In this type of simulation a human is always part of the simulation and consequently influences the outcome in such a way that is difficult if not impossible to reproduce exactly. HITL also readily allows for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> and requirements that may not be easily identified by other means of simulation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{describes}} the adaptation of a rating scale <b>of</b> interpersonal psychotherapy <b>problem</b> areas to include a fifth problem area appropriate to bipolar disorder and an interrater agreement study in identifying interpersonal problem areas and selecting a primary treatment focus if patients were to engage in treatment. METHOD: Five research interpersonal psychotherapists assessed nine audiotapes of a single interview with five bipolar and four unipolar patients in which the interpersonal inventory and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> areas were undertaken. RESULTS: Raters agreed on presence and absence <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> areas in seven tapes. Kappas for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> areas were 1. 00 (grief), 0. 77 (role dispute), 0. 61 (role transition), 0. 57 (interpersonal deficits) and 1. 00 (loss of healthy self). Kappa for agreement on a primary clinical focus if patients were to engage in interpersonal psychotherapy treatment was 0. 64. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation of the original scale to include an area pertinent to bipolar disorder proved to be applicable and relevant for use with this population. The results show substantial interrater agreement in identifying problem areas and potential treatment focus...|$|R

30|$|Other {{studies have}} focused on {{investigating}} the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> design <b>problems</b> from the perspective of developers as well [47, 48]. Sousa et al. [47] conducted a qualitative study to investigate how developers identify design problems in practice. In their study, the authors observed the actions that developers apply to identify design problems. They noticed that some actions were applied to locate program elements to analyze, while other actions were applied to confirm if the location contains or not a design problem. They also observed that developers often search for multiple symptoms <b>of</b> design <b>problems,</b> such as code smells, during the identification. In a subsequent study, Sousa et al. [48] proposed a theory to describe how the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> design <b>problems</b> happens in practice. Their theory explains factors that influence developers during the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> design <b>problems.</b> For instance, the relation among symptoms is a recurring factor that developers take into account. Despite investigating the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> design <b>problems</b> from the perspective of developers, these studies focused on observing developers identifying design problems. Conversely, they did not investigate whether developers can indeed find more design problems when they focus on inspecting stinky program location. Also, they did not provide any evaluation on the requirements for a tool that supports the analysis of stinky code.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess whether}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>problems</b> by {{preventive}} child healthcare professionals (CHPs) in children aged 5 - 6 years has improved {{after a series}} of nationwide interventions. Study design: We analyzed data about 8440 children aged 5 - 6 years who were assessed during routine well-child visits by CHPs (response rates, 85 %- 90 %). Of these children, 4339 were assessed before the interventions. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and CHPs reported on psychosocial problems that they identified in children. The agreement between <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>problems</b> by CHPs and parent-reported problems on the CBCL were assessed before and after the nationwide interventions. Results: CHPs identified psychosocial problems in 22 %- 28 % <b>of</b> all children. <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>problems</b> by CHPs was much more likely in children with an elevated CBCL total problems score than in others (OR: 4. 65, 95 % CI: 3. 28 - 6. 58). The quality <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> by CHPs did not improve after the interventions, the OR for improvement was 0. 81 (95 % CI: 0. 57 - 1. 15). Conclusions: The quality <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> <b>identification</b> by CHPs has not improved. CHPs still miss many cases with parent-reported problems on the CBCL. Additional efforts are needed to improve early <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> psychosocial <b>problems.</b> © Copyright 2012 Mosby Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
