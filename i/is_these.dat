5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It <b>is</b> <b>these</b> ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality <b>is,</b> <b>these</b> critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It <b>is</b> <b>these</b> interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it <b>is</b> <b>these</b> that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E
5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It <b>is</b> <b>these</b> photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It <b>is</b> <b>these</b> capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E

5|$|World War I caused {{problems}} for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when {{the war was over}} there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it <b>is</b> <b>these</b> dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it <b>is</b> <b>these</b> mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current <b>is.</b> <b>These</b> currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{was without}} a {{ceremonial}} home until 1881 when arrangements {{were made to}} display banners, helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, {{in the absence of}} stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick's Hall, in Dublin Castle. On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners {{of the members of the}} Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it <b>is</b> <b>these</b> banners which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on St Patrick's Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974), he lies in state in the hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It <b>is</b> <b>these</b> scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.|$|E
