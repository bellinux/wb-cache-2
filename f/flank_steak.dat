The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. <b>Flank</b> <b>steak</b> was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E
25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, <b>flank</b> <b>steak,</b> charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of provolone cheese cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (<b>flank</b> <b>steak),</b> lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E

500|$|A steak (...) is a meat {{generally}} sliced {{across the}} muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, {{in which the}} meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the skirt steak that is cut from the plate, the <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> that is cut from the abdominal muscles, and the Silverfinger steak that is cut from the loin and includes three rib bones. When the word [...] "steak" [...] is used without qualification, it generally refers to a beefsteak. In a larger sense, there are also fish steaks, ground meat steaks, pork steak and many more varieties of steaks.|$|E
5000|$|In {{parts of}} central Canada, a ground meat patty wrapped in flank or round steak {{is known as}} a London broil. Some butchers will wrap the <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> around a {{concoction}} of seasoned and ground or tenderized <b>flank</b> <b>steak.</b> Others sell a pork sausage patty wrapped in flank or top round steak labelled as London broil. Another variant, popular in Southern Ontario, is a London broil [...] "loaf", wherein the tenderized <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> exterior is wrapped around minced and spiced veal as the filler. In some regions, bacon will be added between the <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> and the veal grind.|$|E
5000|$|Outside skirt steak: A steak {{made from}} the diaphragm. Very flavorful, but also rather tough. It {{is a part of}} the plate (situated at the cow's abdomen), the steak is long, thick and tender. Skirt steaks are not to be {{confused}} with <b>flank</b> <b>steaks</b> because they are near the sirloin and shank. Skirt steaks are used in many international cuisines: Mexican cuisine use this steak for fajitas and arrachera. In the United Kingdom it is often used as filling for Cornish pasties as well as vegetables such as carrot and potato. In Chinese cuisine it is used for stir-fries, in Spanish cuisine the steak is made for churrasco and Italian cuisine use skirt steak for making bolognese sauce as well as with tomatoes.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> is a beef steak {{cut from}} the {{abdominal}} muscles or lower chest of the cow.

50|$|The flank is used {{mostly for}} grinding, {{except for the}} long and flat <b>flank</b> <b>steak,</b> best known for use in London broil, and the inside skirt steak, also used for fajitas. Flank steaks were {{once one of the}} most {{affordable}} steaks, because they are substantially tougher than the more desirable loin and rib steaks. Many modern recipes for <b>flank</b> <b>steak</b> use marinades or moist cooking methods, such as braising, to improve the tenderness and flavor. This, combined with a new interest in these cuts' natural leanness, has increased the price of the <b>flank</b> <b>steak.</b>|$|E
