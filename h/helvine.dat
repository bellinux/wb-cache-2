40|$|SUMMARY. m plot of seventy-five new {{analyses}} {{of members of}} the <b>helvine</b> group and fifty-seven analyses from the literature indicates complete miscibility between the Fe and Zn members (danalite and <b>helvine)</b> and between the Fe and Mn members (danalite and genthelvite). The new analyses in-clude essentially pure <b>helvine</b> and genthelvite (for both of which X-ray data are presented) and the nearest approach to pure danalite (86 at. % Fe). Two new localities for genthelvite, the rarest member, are reported. IN the <b>helvine</b> group, R 4 Bea(SiO 4) 3 S (R = Mn, Fe 2 +, Zn), the member with Mn preponderant, <b>helvine,</b> is commoner than the Fe 2 + member, danalite, and the Zn member, genthelvite, is by far the rarest; only twelve {{analyses of}} genthelvite were found in the literature (six being incomplete analyses), and the largest and finest crystals described had not been analysed...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A zinc-rich <b>helvine</b> (genthelvite) {{has been}} found with bertrandite in miarolitic {{cavities}} in adamellite at Coire an Lochain in the Cairngorm Mountains. The genthelvite occurs as green or brown tetrahedral crystals of sp. gr 3 - 58 i 0 - 01. It is isotropic, n 1. 742 =t= 0 - 003, a 8 - 133 t 0 " 005 /~. Bertrandite crystals are pale brown with sp. gr. 2. 60 ~ 0 - 01; biaxial negative with 2 V 75 ~ and a 1. 590, fl 1. 603, 1. 613, all ~= 0 ' 003. ENTHELVITE [Zn 4 (BeaSia 01 ~) S] and bertrandite [B%(OH) 2 Si 207] have been collected by the writer from the cliffs of Coire an Loch-ain, 1 ~ miles WSW. of Cairn Gorm. In view of the extreme rarity of crystals of genthelvite, {{and the fact that}} the only previous records of both minerals in the British Isles are from Cornwall, it is felt that the occurrence is worth reporting. Beryl is not uncommon in the Cairn-gorm granite pluton and small crystals of blue-green beryl have been found in Coire an Lochain, but not in association with genthelvite or bertrandite. Genthelvite Previous discoveries. Three crystals of genthelvite, the zinc-rich end-member of the <b>helvine</b> group, all from cavities in pegmatite, have been discovered in E 1 Paso County, Colorado. The original specimen was described by Genth (1892), the others by Glass and Adams (1953), and Scott (1957). A notable amount of genthelvite, not as visible crystals, has been recorded by von Knorring and Dyson (1959) from an albite vein and nearby pegmatite in the Jos-Bukuru complex of Northern Nigeria. Eskova (1957) has described irregular segregations and Vasil'ev (1961) xenomorphs from pegmatites in the Kola Peninsula. Tetrahedra of genthelvite have been recorded by Oftedal and Saebo (1963) from three localities in Norway. One is an old specimen the locality of which is uncertain; the others are from nepheline-syenite p gmatites. The only previous occurrence in Great Britain, in an unusual paragenesis...|$|E
