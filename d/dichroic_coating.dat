5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E
25|$|A further {{development}} of the tungsten-halogen bulb has a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> that passes visible light and reflects infrared radiation. The glass in such a bulb may be spherical or tubular. The reflected infrared radiation strikes the filament located at {{the centre of the}} glass envelope, heating the filament to a greater degree than can be achieved through resistive heating alone. The superheated filament emits more light without an increase in power consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Glass gobos [...] {{are made}} from clear glass with a partial mirror coating to block the light and produce [...] "black" [...] areas in the {{projected}} image. This eliminates any need for bridging and accommodates more intricate images. Glass gobos can also include colored areas (much like stained glass windows), whether by multiple layers of dichroic glass (one for each color) glued on an aluminium or chrome coated black and white gobo, or by newer technologies that vary {{the thickness of the}} <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> (and therefore the color) in a controlled way on a single piece of glassâ€”which makes it possible to turn a color photo into a glass gobo. Glass gobos generally offer the highest image fidelity, but are the most fragile. Glass gobos are typically created with laser ablation or photo etching.|$|E
40|$|Tungsten halogen {{projection}} lamps have integral ellipsoidal reflector, and hexagonal shaped plastic Fresnel lenses. Reflector is <b>dichroic</b> <b>coated</b> {{to reduce}} infrared content of reflected radiation. Array of lamps and lenses produces uniform collimated beam having near AM 2 spectrum and intensity {{that can be}} used for testing flat plate solar collectors...|$|R
40|$|A {{low cost}} air mass 2 solar {{simulator}} for testing flat-plate solar collectors {{was developed and}} operated at Lewis. Total cost was less than $ 10, 800 /sq m ($ 1000 /sq ft). It consists of an array of 143 tungsten-halogen 300 -watt lamps, each having integral <b>dichroic</b> <b>coated</b> reflectors. A second array of 143 respective hexagonal-shaped plastic Fresnel lenses are located approximately 1 focal length from the lamps. The simulator will produce a uniform collimated beam covering an area of 1. 2 by 1. 2 m(4 by 4 ft). Design features, construction details, and component costs are given, as well as measured results on a 12 -lamp prototype...|$|R
50|$|Instead of a {{metallic}} <b>coating,</b> a <b>dichroic</b> optical <b>coating</b> may be used. Depending on its characteristics, {{the ratio of}} reflection to transmission will vary {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the incident light. Dichroic mirrors are used in some ellipsoidal reflector spotlights to split off unwanted infrared (heat) radiation, and as output couplers in laser construction.|$|R
5000|$|Dichroic {{glass is}} now {{available}} to artists through <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> manufacturers. Glass artists often refer to dichroic glass as [...] "dichro".|$|E
50|$|Images can {{be formed}} by {{removing}} the <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> from parts of the glass, creating everything from abstract patterns to letters, animals, or faces. The standard method for precision removal of the coating involves a laser.|$|E
50|$|Some lamps use an {{aluminum}} coating as a reflector. Others use selective <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> that reflects visible light and allows infrared radiation to pass through. This type reduces heating of illuminated objects since less infrared radiation {{is present in}} the light beam. However, dichroic lamps must only be used in compatible fixtures that can dissipate the heat.|$|E
40|$|We present high-precision JHK {{photometry}} {{with the}} 3. 8 m UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) of 83 standard stars, 28 from the widely used preliminary list {{known as the}} "UKIRT Faint Standards" (Casali & Hawarden, 1992), referred to here as the Fundamental List, and 55 additional stars {{referred to as the}} Extended List. The stars have 9. 4 <K< 15. 0 and most should be readily observable with imaging array detectors in normal operating modes on telescopes of up to 10 m aperture. Many are accessible from the southern hemisphere. Arcsec-accuracy positions (J 2000, Epoch ~ 1998) are given, together with optical photometry and spectral types from the literature, where available, or inferred from the J-K colour. Finding charts are provided for stars with proper motions exceeding 0. 3 "/yr. On 30 nights between late 1994 and early 1998 the stars from the Fundamental List, which were used as standards for the whole programme, were observed on an average of 10 nights each, and those from the Extended List 6 nights. The average internal standard error of the mean results for K is 0. 005 mag; for J-H it is 0. 003 mag for the Fundamental List stars and 0. 006 mag for the Extended List; for H-K the average is 0. 004 mag. The results are on the natural system of the IRCAM 3 imager, which used a 256 x 256 InSb detector array with "standard" JHK filters, behind gold-coated fore-optics and a gold- or silver-dielectric <b>coated</b> <b>dichroic.</b> We give colour transformations onto the CIT, Arcetri and LCO/Palomar NICMOS systems, and preliminary transformations onto the system defined by the new Mauna Kea Observatory filter set.

50|$|With {{very few}} exceptions, Strong has {{maintained}} a consistent design on Super Trouper models since the first xenon-type models were introduced in the late 1970s. Initially the reflector unit was composed of electroformed nickel with a rhodium plating. Today, Super Trouper follow spots are shipped from the factory with a similarly-designed nickel reflector, though a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> has supplanted the rhodium coating.|$|E

5000|$|The typical {{configuration}} for a red dot sight is a tilted {{spherical mirror}} reflector {{with a red}} light-emitting diode (LED) at its off axis focus. The mirror has a partially silvered multilayer dielectric <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> designed to reflect just the red spectrum allowing it to pass through most other light. The LED used is usually deep red 670 nanometre wavelength since they are very bright, are high contrast against a green scene, and work well with a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> since they are near {{one end of the}} visible spectrum. The size of the dot generated by the LED is controlled by an aperture hole in front of it made from metal or coated glass. The LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight. There is no need for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle. And the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours. Using a [...] "dot" [...] shaped reticle also greatly simplifies the sight since the small diameter image does not require a sophisticated optical reflector to focus it. More complex reticle patterns such as cross hairs or concentric circles can be used but need more complex aberration free optics.|$|E
5000|$|Since the reticle is a {{transmission}} hologram, illuminated by a laser shining through hologram presenting a reconstructed image, {{there is no}} need for the sight [...] "window" [...] to be partially blocked by a semi-silvered or dielectric <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> needed to reflect an image in standard reflex sights. The optical window in a holographic weapon sight looks like a piece of clear glass with an illuminated reticle in the middle. The aiming reticle can be an infinitely small dot whose perceived size is given by the acuity of the eye. For someone with 20/20 vision, it is about 1 minute of arc.|$|E

This eliminates any need for bridging, since the glass itself is the support, and allows more intricate images to be produced. Glass gobos can also include colored areas (much like stained glass windows), whether by multiple layers of dichroic glass (one for each color) glued on an aluminium or chrome coated black and white gobo, or by newer technologies that allow {{the thickness of the}} <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> (and therefore the color) to be varied in a controlled way on a single piece of glass, making it possible to turn a color photo into a glass gobo.

40|$|The APEX {{airborne}} {{imaging spectrometer}} {{has been shown}} to exhibit spectral shifts during in-flight conditions, linked to changes in the nitrogen gas density within the APEX optical subunit. These shifts lead to features in the recorded spectra caused by the <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> used as a beam splitter between VNIR and SWIR channels. Consequently dichroic features are no longer compensated for by the radiometric calibration coefficients obtained under laboratory conditions. This paper presents results of a numerical simulation that can model the impact of spectral shifts on radiometry. As a consequence the APEX sensor model has been upgraded and according correction functions have been implemented in the APEX level 1 processor to compensate for shift dependent changes in radiometry due to the <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|E
3000|$|We {{solved the}} {{mathematical}} model {{described in the}} previous section to design three different TIR collimators. The collimators were designed for two different LEDs, which we refer to as LED 16 and LED 02. Both of them are Luxeon Rebel IES white LEDs without a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating,</b> and have a larger than usual CoA variation. The intensity and chromaticity-coordinates of the LEDs were measured, and the measured data were interpolated. The interpolation polynomials have been used to approximate [...]...|$|E
30|$|A lot of {{research}} has been done to reduce this color variation. Introduction of bubbles in the phosphor layer causes scattering of light, reducing the color variation [3]. Another common method is the application of a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> on the LED [4]. However, these methods reduce the efficiency of the LED and increase the production costs. Wang et al. [5] proposed a modification of the optics on the LED to improve the color uniformity. In the case of a spot light, the LED is combined with a collimator. A collimator is an optical component that reduces the angular width of the light emitted by the LED. A common technique is to add a microstructure on top of the collimator. However, this microstructure introduces extra costs in the production process of the collimator, makes the collimator look unattractive and broadens the light beam.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptual {{design for a}} spectrometer designed specifically for characterizing transiting exoplanets with space-borne infrared telescopes. The design adopting cross-dispersion {{is intended to be}} simple, compact, highly stable, and has capability of simultaneous coverage over a wide wavelength region with high throughput. Typical wavelength coverage and spectral resolving power is 1 - 13 micron with a spectral resolving power of ~ a few hundred, respectively. The baseline design consists of two detectors, two prisms with a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> and microstructured grating surfaces, and three mirrors. Moving parts are not adopted. The effect of defocusing is evaluated for the case of a simple shift of the detector, and anisotropic defocusing to maintain the spectral resolving power. Variations in the design and its application to planned missions are also discussed. Comment: 22 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of well-calibrated radiometric measurements from imaging spectrometer data requires careful consideration of all influencing factors, {{as well as}} an instrument calibration based on a detailed sensor model. Deviations of ambient parameters (i. e., pressure, humidity, temperature) from standard laboratory conditions during airborne operations can lead to biases that should be accounted for and properly compensated by using dedicated instrument models. This study introduces a model for the airborne imaging spectrometer airborne prism experiment (APEX), describing the impact of spectral shifts as well as polarization effects on the radiometric system response due to changing ambient parameters. Key issues are related to changing properties of the <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> applied to the dispersing elements within the optical path. We present a model based on discrete numerical simulations. With the improved modeling approach, we predict radiometric biases with an root mean square error (RMSE) below 1 %, leading to a substantial improvement of radiometric stability and predictability of system behavior...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{efficiency}} {{increases in}} photovoltaic power conversion {{are due to}} improved absorption over the broad spectrum of the sun. Semiconductors have an efficiency peak at a specific wavelength associated with the material band gap. The current trend towards high-efficiency photovoltaics involves multi-junction cells where several semiconductors are grown {{on top of one}} another creating a layered device with a broad spectral response. Fabrication is a difficult and expensive process that results in small area solar cells. An alternative approach uses dielectric mirrors to optically separate the incident light by reflecting one spectral band while transmitting another. Spectral splitting is simulated within a 10 x non-imaging concentrator. The optical system may be concatenated into large arrays and incorporates two separated ray paths exiting at a common plane. Optimized photovoltaic cells can be interleaved on a single circuit board, improving packaging and thermal management compared to orthogonal arrangements. The entire concentrator can be molded from glass or acrylic and requires a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> as the only reflector. Average collection efficiencies above 84 % are realized within 40 Â°x 16 Â° angular acceptance...|$|E
40|$|Shifts {{of center}} {{wavelengths}} (CWLs) and related changes of full-widths at half-maximums (FWHMs) occur during in-flight data acquisitions of push-broom imaging spectrometers {{such as the}} airborne prism experiment (APEX). Combined with the spectrally changing properties of the <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> {{that acts as a}} beam splitter between the visible and near infrared (VNIR) as well as the short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, these shifts affect both the spectral and radiometric accuracies of the spectrometer data, and hence the accuracy of higher level products. In this paper, two independent standards, i. e., atmospheric absorption features as well as features of the standard reference material filter built in the APEX in-flight characterization facility, are used in a complementary way to improve in-flight spectral calibration. The CWL shift and FWHM change for each detector element are simultaneously detected by using spectrum-matching and surface fitting techniques under constraints from pregenerated shift realizations. Subsequently, the APEX spectroradiometric response model is improved in the aspect of spectral resolution by using performance parameters of optics and detector modules. The radiometric gain and offset for each detector element are corrected according to the detected CWLs and FWHMs, as well as the improved APEX response model. Compared with the spectral and radiometric parameters acquired during laboratory calibration, the detected CWLs and FWHMs promote the accuracy of the atmospheric feature positions in the SWIR channel by 10 nm, whereas the corrected gains and offsets reduce the radiance deviation in the spectral regions 375 - 550 nm and 950 - 1080 nm both by 70 % on average...|$|E
40|$|Hybridizing, in general, is the {{approach}} of combining multiple technologies, materials, or designs such to mitigate the drawbacks and enhance the benefits. The result of this combination {{can be referred to}} as a hybrid. The projects described in this work concern a number of these hybrids. The collection of projects are limited to optical applications, but are otherwise enormously different. There is perhaps no better way to illustrate this breadth than their characteristic length-scale. That is, the general size of the elements being hybridized. Ten orders of magnitude lie between the smallest system described and largest systems. At the several-nanometer scale, a single component of a composite optical material. Diamond possesses a unique combination of refractive and dispersive optical properties, making it an attractive optical material. Unfortunately, the lowest cost diamond available possesses large amounts of impurities and color. In an attempt to remove the visible color from commercially available detonation-origin nanodiamond powders we developed a facile three-step cleaning process. This process and the resulting qualities of the nanodiamond are discussed. At tens to hundreds of nanometers scale, we have worked to optimize a complete composite material system; a combination of Polystyrene-b-poly (2 -vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P 2 VP), a block co-polymer with self-assembly properties, and controlled size iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticles. The applications in mind are magnetic field sensors, used in medical testing and physical experiments, and fiber optic isolators, used extensively in telecommunications networks. These composites exhibited commercially significant Verdet constants in room temperature Faraday rotation measurements, and possess processing benefits over the current state-of-the-art magneto-optically active materials. Several behaviors with respect to wavelength, particle loading, and primary particle size are discussed. At the micron to centimeter scale, we have designed and characterized a high-speed fiber-optic switch for telecommunications networks capable of reconfiguring 100 times faster than currently available technologies with comparable port counts. The switch is an unconventional hybrid of the micron-scale optics of single-mode fiber modes, and the centimeter scale of free-space holography. Built primarily using off-the-shelf components and a commercially available digital micro-mirror device (DMD), the switch is protocol and bit-rate agnostic, robust against random mirror failure, and provides the basic building block for a fully reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer (ROADM). Finally, at the scale of several meters, we address a system that hybridizes two established methods for harvesting solar energy. Sunlight can be captured as electricity using photovoltaics (PV), as well as heat, often called concentrated solar power (CSP). Each approach has benefits and drawbacks which will be discussed. A system possessing the peak efficiency of PV, with the deployable storage of CSP, would most effectively meet demand around the clock. In order to combine these technologies, we have developed an approach for designing a <b>dichroic</b> <b>coating</b> to optimize performance of such a system utilizing multi-junction photovoltaic cells while diverting unused light to heat collection. Through careful design substantial improvement to system efficiencies are shown to be possible...|$|E
