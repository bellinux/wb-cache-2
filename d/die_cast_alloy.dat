The size and arrangement of microstructural constituents and pores are characterized quantitatively using image analyzing techniques. The nearest neighbor distribution of the intermetallic particles is determined. The area fraction of porosity in rheo-cast AM 50 is about half that found in the high pressure <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>alloy.</b> In rheo-cast material, the distribution of p phase (Mg 17 Al 12) is relatively uniform throughout the cast. In contrast, the beta phase particles tend to form macroscopic agglomerates in high pressure die cast material. The externally solidified grains in the rheo-cast material exhibit a smaller aluminum gradient than in the high pressure <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>alloy.</b> This indicates that the solidification of the rheo-cast material is closer to equilibrium...|$|E

The analysis of tensile behavior shows that the squeeze cast A 380 exhibits a high tensile toughness (8. 5 MJ·m- 3) and resilience (179. 3 kJ·m- 3) compared with the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>alloy</b> (toughness: 1. 4 MJ·m- 3, resilience: 140. 6 kJ·m- 3), despite that, during the onset of plastic deformation, the strain-hardening rate of the die cast specimen is higher than that of the squeeze cast specimens. The microstructure analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that both the squeeze and die cast specimens contain the primary α-Al, Al 2 Cu, Al 5 FeSi phase and the eutectic Si phase. But, the Al 2 Cu phase present in the squeeze cast alloy is relatively large in size and quantity.

The Gurson model was extended to simulate shear failure by using an additional failure criterion for the region between pure shear and uniaxial tension. To verify the damage models component tests under crash relevant loadings were performed and simulated with the damage parameters which were obtained by modelling the tension and shear tests on small scale specimens. The Gurson model and the Johnson-Cook model were compared with regard to the applicability of the damage parameters for different stress triaxialities.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to develop a material composition that can be processed by rapid prototyping (RP) in order to produce tooling for the die casting process. Where these rapidly produced tools will be superior to traditional tooling production methods by offering {{one or more of the}} following advantages: reduced tooling cost, shortened tooling creation time, reduced man-hours for tool creation, increased tool life, and shortened die casting cycle time. ^ By utilizing RP 2 ̆ 7 s additive build process and vast material selection, there was a prospect that die cast tooling may be produced quicker and with superior material properties. To this end, the material properties that influence die life and cycle time were determined, and a list of materials that fulfill these “optimal” properties were highlighted. Physical testing was conducted in order to grade the processability of each of the material systems and to optimize the manufacturing process for the downselected material system. ^ Sample specimens were produced and microscopy techniques were utilized to determine a number of physical properties of the material system. Additionally, a benchmark geometry was selected and die casting dies were produced from traditional tool materials (H 13 steel) and techniques (machining) and from the newly developed materials and RP techniques (selective laser sintering (SLS) and laser engineered net shaping (LENS)). Once the tools were created, a <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>alloy</b> was selected and a preset number of parts were shot into each tool. ^ During tool creation, the manufacturing time and cost was closely monitored and an economic model was developed to compare traditional tooling to RP tooling. This model allows one to determine, in the early design stages, when it is advantageous to implement RP tooling and when traditional tooling would be best. ^ The results of the physical testing and economic analysis has shown that RP tooling is able to achieve a number of the research objectives, namely, reduce tooling cost, shorten tooling creation time, and reduce the man-hours needed for tool creation. Though identifying the appropriate time to use RP tooling appears to be the most important aspect in achieving successful implementation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{characteristics of}} various aluminum alloys, aluminum composites and some surface treated aluminum are evaluated in lubricant/refrigerant mixtures. All of these evaluations {{are based upon}} a specimen testing program using a high pressure tribometer (HPT). This research program mainly consists of two parts. The {{first part of this}} study is mainly focused on materials screening of various aluminum alloys/steel contact pairs lubricated by polyolesterlR 134 a and PAGIR 134 a lubricant/refrigerant (LIR) mixtures. In this study, various aluminum alloys are tested under the same environmental and operating conditions in order to compare their wear resistance. The results show that the lowest wear is obtained with the 390 <b>Die</b> <b>Cast</b> <b>alloy.</b> This alloy has the largest amount of silicon content and the highest bulk hardness. The results also show that, in general, the amount of wear decreases as the amount of silicon content in AI-Si alloys increases. Better wear resistance is also achieved if the amount of copper and bismuth are increased. Conventional anodizing does not improve the wear resistance of the 356 aluminum alloy under concentrated contacts. Hard anodizing and a SiC-AI composite provide very good wear resistance. However, they cause increased wear on the counterface by abrasion due to the rough, hard, surfaces generated by hard anodizing processes and the hard SiC particles. From the wear results obtained, the Ester/R 134 a mixtures consistently provide better protection of the aluminum alloys compared to the PAG/R 134 a mixtures. If sufficient amounts of R 134 a exists in the LlR mixture, extensive surface fatigue on 356 aluminum is observed. In the second part, two AI-Si alloys (356 -T 61 and 390 -T 61), widely used in critical components of refrigerant compressors, are examined fortheir friction and wear behavior in different LIR mixtures. The LIR mixtures tested include ester and PAG lubricants with R 134 a, mineral and alkylbenzene lubricants with R 22, R 407 C and R 410 A, as well as an ester lubricant with both R 407 C and R 41 OA. Based on the wear data obtained, the capped P AG seems to be a better lubricant for 356 alloy than the uncapped PAG. However, the lubricity of the PAG's is about the same with the 390 alloy. When the ester lubricant is used, the wear on each alloy is about the same in R 134 a, R 407 C, R 410 A and air environments. There is no significant difference in lubricity of mineral and alkylbenzene lubricants when used with R 22 and its possible substitutes R 407 C and R 410 A.

Third, various exploratory studies were conducted to determine the feasibility of novel friction stir welding techniques for joining of dissimilar materials, porosity reduction, creation of in-situ metal-matrix composites for local reinforcement, and welding of <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> <b>alloys.</b> These findings will be systematically presented and discussed...|$|R
