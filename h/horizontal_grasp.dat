In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. [...] "John thought about the calculator" [...] or [...] "Jane remembered the thumbtack"). After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. <b>horizontal</b> <b>grasp</b> for calculator sentences). Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition. These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed. The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also {{highlights the importance of}} the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word. A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al., described in detail elsewhere, demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two pendulums, one with each hand, either in-phase (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees). Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement. [...] This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense. Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers ("He is swinging the bat"), or actions that could not be performed ("The barn is housing the goat"). Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs ("He is swinging the hope"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task. The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions. This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement, and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{manner in}} which the <b>horizontal</b> bar is <b>grasped</b> by a gymnast is called the grip (not to be {{confused}} with the suede leather grips that are worn on the hands). Each grip is commonly used for a particular set of skills. When gymnasts compete on the horizontal bar they are often required by the Code of Points to use specific grips.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} how environmental design shapes perceptual-motor exploration, when meta-stable regions of performance are created. Here, we examined how creating meta-stable regions of performance could destabilize pre-existing skills, favoring greater exploration of performance environments, exemplified {{in this study}} by climbing surfaces. In this investigation we manipulated hold orientations on an indoor climbing wall to examine how nine climbers explored, learned, and transferred various trunk-rolling motion patterns and hand grasping movements. The learning protocol consisted of four sessions, in which climbers randomly ascended three different routes, as fluently as possible. All three routes were 10. 3 m in height and composed of 20 hand-holds at the same locations on an artificial climbing wall; only hold orientations were altered: (i) a horizontal-edge route was designed to afford <b>horizontal</b> hold <b>grasping,</b> (ii) a vertical-edge route afforded vertical hold grasping, and (iii), a double-edge route was designed to afford both horizontal and vertical hold grasping. As a meta-stable condition of performance invite an individual to both exploit his pre-existing behavioral repertoire (i. e., <b>horizontal</b> hold <b>grasping</b> pattern and trunk face to the wall) and explore new behaviors (i. e., vertical hold grasping and trunk side to the wall), {{it was hypothesized that}} the double-edge route characterized a meta-stable region of performance. Data were collected from inertial measurement units located on the neck and hip of each climber, allowing us to compute rolling motion referenced to the artificial climbing wall. Information on ascent duration, the number of exploratory and performatory movements for locating hand-holds, and hip path was also observed in video footage from a frontal camera worn by participants. Climbing fluency was assessed by calculating geometric index of entropy. Results showed that the meta-stable condition of performance may have afforded utilization of more adaptive climbing behaviors (expressed in higher values for range and variability of trunk rolling motion and greater number of exploratory movements). Findings indicated how climbers learn to explore and, subsequently, use effective exploratory search strategies that can facilitate transfer of learning to performance in novel climbing environments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to propose a method for {{full-body}} movement pattern recognition in climbing, by computing the 3 D unitary vector of the four limbs and pelvis during performance. One climber with an intermediate skill level traversed two easy routes of similar rates of difficulty (5 c difficulty on French scale), 10 m in height under top-rope conditions. The first route was simply designed to allow <b>horizontal</b> edge-hold <b>grasping,</b> while the second route was designed with more complexity to allow both horizontal and vertical edge-hold grasping. Five inertial measurement units (IMUs) were attached to the pelvis, both feet and forearms to analyse the 3 D unitary vector of each limb and pelvis. Cluster analysis was performed to detect the number of clusters that emerged from coordination of the four limbs and pelvis during climbing performance. Analysis revealed 22 clusters with 11 clusters unique across the two routes. Six clusters were unique to the simple hold design route and five clusters emerged only in the complex hold design route. We conclude that clustering supported identification of full-body orientations during traversal, representing a level of analysis that can provide useful information for performance monitoring in climbing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{recent studies}} of human motor learning, {{subjects}} learned to move the arm while grasping a robotic device that applied novel patterns of forces to the hand. Here, we examined the generality of force field learning. We tested the idea that contextual cues asso-ciated with grasping a novel object promote the acqui-sition and use of a distinct internal model, associated with that object. Subjects learned to produce point-to-point arm movements to targets in a <b>horizontal</b> plane while <b>grasping</b> a robotic linkage that applied either a velocity-dependent counter-clockwise or clockwise force field to the hand. Following adaptation, subjects {{let go of the}} robot and were asked to generate the same movements in free space. Small but reliable after-effects were observed during the first eight movements in free space, however, these after-effects were significantly smaller than those observed for control subjects who moved the robot in a null field. No reduction in reten-tion was observed when subjects subsequently returned to the force field after moving in free space. In contrast, controls who reached with the robot in a NF showed much poorer retention when returning to a force field. These findings are consistent with the idea that contex-tual cues associated with grasping a novel object may promote the acquisition of a distinct internal model of the dynamics of the object, separate from internal models used to control limb dynamics alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the human anterior intraparietal area and the dorsal premotor cortex to arbitrary visuo-motor mapping during grasping were tested. Trained right-handed subjects reached for and pincer-grasped a cube with the right hand {{in the absence of}} visual feedback after the cube location had been displayed for 200 ms. During the reaching movements, the colour of the cube changed and visual feedback about the change of colour was provided for 100 ms at 500 ms after movement onset (at the time of peak grasp aperture). Depending on colour, subjects were instructed to either pincer-grasp the cube in a <b>horizontal</b> or vertical <b>grasp</b> position with the latter necessitating wrist rotation (experiment 1) or to pincer-grasp and transport the cube to either a left or right target position (experiment 2). Within two consecutive 200 ms time windows (TMS 1 and 2) starting 500 ms and 700 ms after movement onset, respectively, double pulses of supra-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (inter-stimulus interval: 100 ms) were delivered over (i) the left primary motor cortex (90 degrees vertically angulated coil position, control stimulation), (ii) the left dorsal premotor cortex or (ii) the left anterior intraparietal area. Compared to control stimulation, stimulation of the anterior intraparietal area, but not of the dorsal premotor cortex, at TMS 1 delayed the times to wrist rotation (experiment 1) and hand transport (experiment 2). Compared to control stimulation, stimulation of the dorsal premotor cortex, but not of the anterior intraparietal area, at TMS 2 delayed both wrist rotation (experiment 1) and hand transport (experiment 2). We contend that the anterior intraparietal area and the dorsal premotor cortex are both involved albeit at different phases during the mapping of arbitrary visual cues with goal directed grasp and transport movements. These data add to the current understanding of how human cortical areas work in concert during manual activities...|$|R
