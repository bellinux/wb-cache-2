500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may not get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} films were highly praised {{due to their}} [...] tone. However, when {{director}} Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt [...] "Singer's sensitivity to [...] made the first two X-Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups." [...] James Berardinelli felt, [...] "X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as taut or satisfying as X-Men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original X-Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, {{there seems to be}} a single vision." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker praised [...] "the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work", but called Ratner's film [...] "a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes." [...] Singer's third film in the series, X-Men: Days of Future Past was also highly praised. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that [...] "Singer keeps things moving along briskly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me.

500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E
2500|$|New Line {{president}} Toby Emmerich {{said that}} the success of the video games combined with Tancharoen's vision means, [...] "You don't have to squint too hard to see how it might make a good movie", while Tancharoen says discussions have only concerned an R-rating, with darker, more brutal martial arts. After discussions at the 2011 Comic-Con with Uziel and Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon, Tancharoen said to expect an origin story in the style of Rebirth and Legacy as opposed to the traditional Mortal Kombat mythology. He said, [...] "I've always been a fan of properties like Batman where you can expand the universe in different directions. Mortal Kombat is big <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can allow for multiple different kinds of storytelling." [...] But as for its continuity with the web series, he said [...] "you won't have to have seen all ten episodes previously - or have played the video game - to understand the movie."

2500|$|In 1580, certain Jacobites of Bakhdida {{began to}} build {{relations}} with Rome through the monastery of Mar Bihnam, {{but it was not}} until the 18th century that these Jacobites began to join the Vatican and became known as Syrian Catholics. Recently, the Dominicans celebrated 250 years of their presence in the north of Iraq. There was much unrest between the new Catholics and the original Jacobite Christians. It is reported that when Catholic bishop Essa Mahfoodh went to see the Jacobite Patriarch Elias II Hindi al-Mosulli (1837–1847) in order to secure the division of properties between the two groups, he was received with insulting remarks. The patriarch told the Catholic bishop: [...] "French (Papists), isn't it <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> divided my people in Mardin? Have you now come to Mosul to do the same thing here?" [...] Backed by the French, the bishop went to Mohammad Pasha, the Turkish governor, and presented his complaint to him. In 1837 the properties (churches and monasteries), manuscripts, and furniture were divided in a special manner between the two Assyrian denominations.|$|E

2500|$|Warcraft III was {{met with}} {{universal}} acclaim, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. While GamePro noted that [...] "WarCraft III doesn’t revolutionize the RTS genre", they still praised Blizzard for delivering a title with [...] "a well-executed story, drum-tight game-play and a long shelf life as a multi-player title." [...] GameSpot noted that as with StarCraft, the ability to experience the action from all sides [...] "is of great appeal." [...] The reviewer also noted that Warcraft III made {{the early stages of}} the game more interesting and less formulaic; in most RTS games, he noted, [...] "the initial build-up period in such games is merely a race to get to the best units first." [...] Most reviewers noted that Blizzard had finally fleshed out the storyline of the first two Warcraft titles, giving each side its own motivations and differences beyond cosmetics.

2500|$|Philbert Ortiz Dy of ClickTheCity.com {{rated the}} film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "all in all, Dukot {{is a pretty}} {{engaging}} film. From scene to scene, it manages to maintain a certain tone and build up the tension. But it’s all in service of a narrative that doesn’t have any thematic follow-through. The film builds so much moral ambiguity, and there’s so much left to dissect as the film raises the volume on the music and jumps to its conclusion. This is a sharp piece of filmmaking, but what it ends up saying through its abandonment of its complexity is questionable at best." [...] Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "Dukot {{might not be as}} thrilling or as meaty as the themes it tackles, but it is a well-made suspense thriller that doesn’t come often in Philippine cinemas. It lacks power in its narrative even though it hints some every now and then, but the shots are tastefully done and the story is decent <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get to feel the tense of the situation and what the characters are going through emotionally. Well, some of it." [...] Rey de la Cruz Jr. of FHM Philippines rated the film 7.5 out of 10 describing the film as [...] "a well-directed suspense thriller about a real-life kidnapping. Nice to see an actor like Enrique Gil finally show off his acting skills." [...] Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a less positive review wrote that [...] "the film’s failure really lies in its misdirected ambitions. It only provokes partially, quickly retreating from its hefty provocations just when the opportunity to get darker and more vicious opens up. Again, it’s all interesting in premise. Everything else is just too safe." [...] Kevin Tan of Film Police Reviews rated the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that [...] "Dukot can be commended on injecting fresh ideas into the local mainstream industry, and it shows Soriano’s maturity in his craft. However, the script lacks the guts to deliver a story as dark and gritty as its visuals. Dukot holds back on depicting hostility and violence that could have rendered audiences more upset and unsettled about today’s reality the moment they exit theaters." ...|$|E
