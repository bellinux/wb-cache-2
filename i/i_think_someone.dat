2500|$|During the album's {{listening}} {{party on}} August 20, 2012 at Germano Studios in Manhattan, New York, Two Elevens executive producer Breyon Prescott revealed {{that there would}} be fifteen songs on the final track listing. Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to {{what the rest of the}} album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in my wildest dreams did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)." [...] During the course of the song, Norwood mentions herself several times, over the [...] "thawacking percussion" [...] and production.|$|E

5000|$|Michel Petrucciani {{came from}} an Italo-French family (his {{grandfather}} was from Naples) with a musical background. His father Tony played guitar, his brother Louis played bass, and his brother Philippe also plays the guitar. Michel was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, which is a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. It is also often linked to pulmonary ailments. The disease caused his bones to fracture over 100 times before he reached adolescence and kept him in pain throughout his entire life. [...] "I have pain all the time. I'm used to having hurt arms," [...] he said. In Michel's early career, his father and brother occasionally carried him {{because he could not}} walk far on his own unaided. In certain respects he considered his disability an advantage, as he got rid of distractions like sports that other boys tended to become involved in. And he hints that his disability was helpful in other parts of his life. He said: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> upstairs saved me from being ordinary." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Wildest Dreams" [...] is a mid-tempo R&B song {{written by}} Sean Garrett, Justin Henderson and Christoper Whitacre, with {{production}} helmed {{by the latter}} two under the production company moniker Tha Bizness. Described by Norwood as a [...] "90s 2012 record", [...] "Wildest Dream" [...] contains strong themes about love. Speaking on the song's content Norwood said, [...] "It's about love. It's about {{falling in love with}} someone and it's almost like it's too good to be true. It's a mid-tempo." [...] The song focuses on falling in love and it feeling better than one could have imagined. MTV Buzzworthy described the song as a throwback to [...] "classic R&B" [...] with a [...] "laidback" [...] tone. Steven J. Horrowitz from Rolling Stone described the base of the song was described as [...] "thawacking percussion" [...] and melodic production. [...] "I reconnected with Ryanbecause I had met him before, we kinda fell in love. Basically the song is just about me feeling like, [...] "Wow. I can't believe this is really happening." [...] He loves me for every personality I have. He loves me for every flaw. He accepts me as who I am and he can see me for who I am. He's dope for that. I see him too. So, never in my wildest dreams..." [...] — Norwood talking to Rap-Up about the song. The title of the song is built around the recurring lines: [...] "And now I'm receiving abundance of love/ And I get it/ But never could imagine it/ Never in my wildest dreams, no, no, no/ Did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> could care about me, oh/ Not just the way you love me". A introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] includes the lyrics [...] "Never in my wildest dreams did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)." [...] During the course of the song, Norwood mentions herself several times, with lines like [...] "It's hard to hold back tears whenever you hold me close, I think about the years and been saying this is all I want, Just wanted someone real to love me for me, me, just Brandy." [...] MTV Buzzworthy compared the songs to Norwood's previous singles [...] "Full Moon" [...] (2002) and [...] "Right Here (Departed)" [...] (2008). Norwood said that the song was inspired by her newfound love with music executive Ryan Press.|$|E

The band's lead singer, Bassingthwaighte, states [...] "this song {{seems to me to be}} saying 'You have issues but you can get over it', so I prefer to be realistic than stylistic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> know when I sing it."

During her {{time away from the}} spotlight, Walker also provided backing vocals for Jennifer Hudson and Fergie. She explained that [...] "I wasn't really thinking about coming back with another album because I thought, 'You know what? I'm not really trying to do the artist thing anymore. I love to sing but let me just work alongside people." [...] She explained her hiatus from the music industry by saying [...] "If you're an artist doing something else you feel like people aren't really trying to buy into it because these artists have flooded the market so much. It just makes you wonder, 'Why should I bother? No one's going to be interested in what I'm trying to do. I was locked into that industry.

[...] She has also spoke about her character's softer side stating: [...] "She's like a bulldozer, she just storms in and goes nuts, and she's a real maneater. But {{at the same time}} what I love is that they let me show her vulnerability. If you're a big two-dimensional comedy character, it's good fun {{for a couple of weeks}} but then that's it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> who's as brash and brazen as her needs to show a flip-side, there's a reason why she acts the way she does and we get to see that too." [...] The official E4 publicity describes her as 'the bubbly tart with a heart’ and states that she spells out trouble for the males and causes a ruckus for the females. During an interview on loose Women Waugh spoke about her character stating: [...] "I play the maneater of the village that tries to get them all but it doesn't really work." ...|$|E

It might be in a very raw form to start with, but as we go, we constantly make rough mixes. You could probably go from the first one through about 12 or 20 mixes and hear what the change will be.

Over 60% of the dialogue in the picture is out of Hemingway's book... We treated it as something Holy... We showed the script to him and he made some changes.

After greeting the audience, David introduces [...] "The Remote" [...] by pretending to be holding a remote control. He explains that The Remote can control the action on-screen. He demonstrates by pressing various buttons, which control Shane's actions. For example, [...] "Fast Forward" [...] causes Shane to move and speak fast, [...] "Pause" [...] causes him to freeze, [...] "Rewind", which causes anyone to move and speak backwards, [...] "Mute", which causes Shane to speak without any sound. In many episodes, David discovers a previously unknown [...] "Wild-card Button," [...] such as [...] "Humongous" [...] (and its opposite, the [...] "Minute" [...] button). This button causes some strange and/or undesired effect. He presses unknown buttons on the remote after saying [...] "Hmm" [...] or [...] "Ooh, I wonder what this button does." [...] David then offers The Remote to the viewer and [...] "hands it over" [...] by reaching off-screen downward. The brothers direct the viewer to [...] "press the Play button." [...] At this point, a strange and/or undesired effect happens ("Uh-oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone</b> pressed the _____ button").

Vincent went on to say how viewers will [...] "have to keep watching" [...] {{to find out if the}} wedding will commence.

[...] Duttine spoke to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, insisting that Tim should not become aggressive when he discovers Sally and Kevin's kiss: [...] "I don't really want to see Tim become aggressive or become a player either. I just think that he's a decent bloke who likes his creature comforts and a simple life." [...] Duttine continued to talk about the fallout of the revelation: [...] "I think Tim will be heartbroken when he finds out the truth. It's definitely not going to be plain sailing. As for whether Tim will punch Kevin, I don't think Tim's the fighting type." [...] Duttine and Dynevor later discussed their thoughts on going live with Katie Fitzpatrick from the Manchester Evening News, with Duttine admitting that going live is one of [...] "the scariest thing you’ve ever done because you don’t want to be the first one to mess up Coronation Street after years and years."

Smart ass. I looked up the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>someone's</b> yanking your chain." [...] And I had to look it up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler".

In discussing his notion of the artist's relationship to politics and power however, Michals feels ultimately that aspirations are useless:I feel the political aspirations are impotent.

If one is to act politically, one simply puts down the camera and goes out and does something. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>someone</b> like Heartfield who ridiculed the Nazis.
