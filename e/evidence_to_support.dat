It might be the same place where the present village, Kunauli (earlier known as Kunal Gram) {{at the bank of}} Kosi river on the Indo-Nepal Border is situated.

40|$|By mapping {{nucleotide}} sequences onto a "DNA walk", we uncovered remarkably long-range {{power law}} correlations [Nature 356 (1992) 168] that imply a new scale invariant property of DNA. We found such long-range correlations in intron-containing genes and in non-transcribed regulatory DNA sequences, {{but not in}} cDNA sequences or intron-less genes. In this paper, we present more explicit <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> our findings...|$|R

His grandfather, Andrea Polo {{of the parish}} of San Felice, had three sons, Maffeo, yet another Marco, and the traveller's father Niccolò. This genealogy, described by Ramusio, is not universally accepted {{as there is no}} additional <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> it.|$|E

However, McCullough and Williams {{found no evidence}} of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B.Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> such a relation.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined {{that there was no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E

While there is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems {{had no effect on}} aging.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> this.|$|E
5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> this.|$|E

The purpose of the expedition was <b>to</b> look for <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> The Book of Mormon; collectors gathered field notes, photos, botany samples, and correspondences.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a lack of {{substantial}} archaeological or literary <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the defence-in-depth theory. J.C. Mann points out that there is no evidence, either in the Notitia Dignitatum or in the archaeological record, that units along the Rhine or Danube were stationed in the border hinterlands. On the contrary, virtually all forts identified as built or occupied in the 4th century on the Danube lay on, very near or even beyond the river, strikingly similar to the 2nd-century distribution.|$|E

It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
