50|$|The {{access control}} domain deals with {{implementation}} of access controls across all electronic forms of information processing systems like operating systems, applications, networks or mobile platforms.

The policy should aim to control the assimilation, authorization, and dissemination of information in a controlled manner. The typical organizational objectives of the access control policy are to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for user registration and de-registration, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to grant the correct level of access privilege, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control password use, password change and password removal, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for managements review of access rights, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for unattended equipment, maintain a clear desk policy, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control network service access, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> control method for authentication of remote users, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for configuration ports, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to segregate networks, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to use precise routing controls, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control system utilities and to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to secure communications over mobile computing devices.|$|R
