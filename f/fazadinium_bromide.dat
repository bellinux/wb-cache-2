40|$|The neuromuscular {{blocking}} {{characteristics and}} plasma concentration decay of <b>fazadinium</b> <b>bromide,</b> a short acting, non-depolarizing muscular relaxant, were simultaneously observed under standardised conditions in 6 healthy, anaesthetized, adult patients. The results {{were analyzed by}} a new pharmacodynamic model, which takes into account certain relationships describing the binding of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and the postsynaptic receptor occupation ratio. According to the simulations performed, the pharmacodynamic parameters determined: KB-apparent value of equilibrium constant of fazadinium - receptors exchange (mean ± SEM) 0. 404 + 0. 045 μmol/l, {{and the value of}} postsynaptic occupation ratio for 50 % paralysis of 0. 89 ± 0. 004 were in agreement with values reported in the literature for mammalian neuromuscular junctions in vitro. The apparent validity of the pharmacodynamic model and its value in simulating dose/effect relationships of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are discussed and illustrated. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.
