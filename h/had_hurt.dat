5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not like}} the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E

5|$|As {{their plans}} to emigrate step up a gear, Lewis forges a plan to steal money from Peter Barlow's (Chris Gascoyne) betting shop by cashing fraudulently franked betting slips. His scam is successful, and he cheats on Audrey when he kisses Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride). Lewis flees the UK; he made his last {{appearance}} on 13 August 2010. Just over a year later, it was announced Havers would reprise his role as Lewis and return to Coronation Street in February 2012.

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E

5|$|Before Charles's restoration, the Navigation Acts of 1650 <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> Dutch trade {{by giving}} English vessels a monopoly, and {{had started the}} First Dutch War (1652–1654). To lay {{foundations}} for a new beginning, envoys of the States General appeared in November 1660 with the Dutch Gift. The Second Dutch War (1665–1667) was started by English attempts to muscle in on Dutch possessions in Africa and North America. The conflict began well for the English, with the capture of New Amsterdam (renamed New York in honour of Charles's brother James, Duke of York) and a victory at the Battle of Lowestoft, but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack on England (the Raid on the Medway) when they sailed up the River Thames to where {{a major part of}} the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, Royal Charles, which was taken back to the Netherlands as a trophy. The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Breda.|$|E
5|$|Bradman then {{returned}} {{in the next}} match against Surrey at The Oval in London, winning the toss and electing to bat. The last time Australia had played at the ground was the Fifth Test in 1938, when England declared at a world record score of 7/903; Bradman <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> his ankle, {{and was unable to}} bat as Australia fell to the largest defeat in Test history. This match was a far different experience for the Australians. Barnes and Morris put on 136 before Bradman came in to join Barnes; together they added another 207 before Barnes fell for 176. Bradman started slowly and was heckled by the crowd for taking 80 minutes to reach 50, but accelerated and went on to score 146 before being dismissed at 3/403, with Australia proceeding to be all out for 632. He had attacked the medium pacers with his pull shot, but had some difficulties reading the left arm wrist spin of Australian expatriate John McMahon, nearly being caught behind the wicket on multiple occasions. Australia then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E

25|$|The American Revolution {{stimulated the}} {{domestic}} market for wheat and iron ore, and flour milling increased in Baltimore. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade during the War of 1812 <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered the city's economic growth.

25|$|During the offseason, Nicklaus {{addressed}} {{two problems}} which <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout {{noticed that he}} had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed {{with the help of}} Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.|$|E

25|$|The Ram defense held Dallas to only 85 rushing yards; Dallas' {{defense was}} equally stingy, {{allowing}} 120 rushing yards but the Rams needed 49 attempts to achieve this. Constant Ram pressure caused Staubach {{to have one}} of his worst playoff games ever as he was 15 of 37 for 150 yards; he was sacked 4 times and threw 3 interceptions. In addition, Staubach, who <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> the Rams the year before with his scrambling runs, gained only 8 yards rushing. Ram QB Pat Haden couldn't do much better vs. Dallas' tough defense; he was 10 for 21 for 152 yards and also threw 3 interceptions.|$|E
25|$|The new Chien-Cheng Circle {{was opened}} in the evening of October 4, 2003, housing 20 food booths and a {{performing}} arts center {{at the top of}} the building. To promote the opening, the city government gave away 700 food-tasting coupons worth NT$100 each and organized a tour led by Chuang Yung-ming (莊永明), vice-chairman of the municipal research department and professor at the Taipei Medical University. Although the new building was intended to revitalize the market, food vendors had complained that the modern building did not reflect the market's history and lacked a traditional, cultural feeling. They also said that a lack of promotion and assistance from the city government <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> business.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E

25|$|Kawauchi {{improved}} his half marathon best to 1:02:40 at the Kagawa Marugame Half Marathon in February 2011, finishing inside the top ten. He {{set his sights}} on a top eight finish at the Tokyo Marathon later that month but exceeded his own expectations by running a time of 2:08:37 hours and taking third place. As the best Japanese performer, he earned selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. In June he entered the Okinoshima Ultramarathon and led the 50km race right up to the last 600 metres, at which point he collapsed due to heat stroke and failed to finish the race. At the World Championship Marathon held in Daegu he finished in 18th place – a performance which helped the Japanese team including Hiroyuki Horibata and Kentaro Nakamoto to a silver medal in the 2011 World Marathon Cup. He competed extensively {{towards the end of the}} year and his form held well: he managed fourth at the Osaka Marathon, then took third at the Fukuoka Marathon. The latter was an Olympic qualifying race and he was the first placed Japanese. The Japan Association of Athletics Federations played down his selection choices, saying his time of 2:09:57 was not fast enough, but Kawauchi upturned tradition by saying the race was a warm-up for the second qualifier in Tokyo – Japanese runners rarely enter both selection races due to their proximity in the running calendar. Only two weeks later Kawauchi entered the Hofu Marathon and was runner-up behind Mongolia's Serod Bat-Ochir. He remarked that the fatigue from the previous race <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> his chances of winning the race.|$|E
25|$|England were {{dismissed}} just before tea, so the interval was taken early and Ian Redpath and Ian Chappell {{came out to}} open as Rick McCoster was still dazed from his injury, having fielded {{for only a few}} overs in the morning before he had to retire again. Chappell was caught by David Lloyd close to the ground off Willis, but there no immediate appeal as Lloyd <b>had</b> <b>hurt</b> his bruised fingers and left to have then tended when the Australian captain was given out. This brought in his brother Greg Chappell at 15/1 and he added 108 runs with Redpath {{by the end of the}} day, with 100 runs coming in 110 minutes. Resuming on 123/1 Redpath and Chappell took their partnership to 220 runs, a record for Australia against England in Australia, beating the 216 made by Bill Woodfull and Hunter Hendry back in 1928–29. These came slowly at first as Edrich set defensive filed and Arnold and Willis bowled accurately for the first 90 minutes. However, when they were replaced by Underwood, Titmus and Greig, Chappell increased the run-rate and when Willis returned the Queensland captain took 13 runs off one over. He made his first century of the series, 1,000 run of the season and was dropped on 136 by Underwood at deep fine-leg with The Hill braying behind him. He was out for 144 trying to hit Arnold for six and skying the ball to Lloyd at mid-wicket. Chappell had now made 122, 51, 58, 71, 62, 2, 61, 44, 84 and 144 against the tourists in the season, including the Queensland vs MCC match and the One Day International. Walters came in and tried to impress his fans with another Perth-like run feast, but tried to hit Underwood across the line and was bowled for 5. With the sluggish Redpath now setting the pace and England trying to delay the declaration the game drifted, but the opener was out for 105 in 344 minutes when he uncharacteristically hit out at Underwood (2/65) and was caught by the substitute Chris Old. A few runs late Marsh was nearly run out and hurried off to the pavilion as Australia declared at 289/4, leaving England 400 runs to win in 500 minutes.|$|E
