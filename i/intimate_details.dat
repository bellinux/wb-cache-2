Aside from deduced self-portraits in Cănuţă om sucit and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu ("Uncle Iancu"), building on his colloquial name and {{his status as a}} regular client of the beer gardens. He introduces several of his Momente şi schiţe characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with <b>intimate</b> <b>details.</b> Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache's wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.|$|E
25|$|Émile Zola {{was born}} in Paris in 1840, {{the son of an}} Italian engineer. He was raised by his mother in Aix-en-Provence, then {{returned}} to Paris in 1858 with his friend Paul Cézanne to attempt a literary career. He worked as a mailing clerk for the publisher Hachette and began attracting literary attention in 1865 with his novels in the new style of naturalism. He described in <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> the workings of Paris department stores, markets, apartment buildings and other institutions, and the lives of the Parisians. By 1877, he had become famous and wealthy from his writing. He took {{a central role in the}} Dreyfus affair, helping win justice for Alfred Dreyfus, a French artillery officer of Alsatian Jewish background, who had falsely been accused of treason.|$|E
25|$|Although {{admired by}} his contemporaries, {{he was also}} criticized for using his highly {{efficient}} secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens. His services opened private letters sent through the mail, which was a frequent practice in Europe at the time, and spied on families. Sartine was thus aware {{of all sorts of}} scandals in the city, notably sexual scandals, and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> about courtiers, clerics, and private citizens, which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from the boredom of court life. Furthermore, his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators, dissenters, anticlerical propagandists, and other people perceived as trouble makers, who were imprisoned without trial through the lettres de cachet. Some sources say that there were never more political prisoners at the Bastille and at the fortress of Vincennes than under his tenure.|$|E

25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because she could hear him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E

[...] Burr and Eustis exchanged {{letters on the}} most intimate subjects, recommending potential romantic partners {{to each other and}} sharing a taste for well-educated women. [...] Eustis aided Burr on one occasion by helping him find accommodations for a young woman whose mother had been involved in an adulterous relationship with Alexander Hamilton; she was placed in a Boston-area boarding school. [...] Eustis may have also been the subject of a teenage crush by Burr's daughter Theodosia, who shared <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> of her life with him (including medical conditions emanating from a difficult pregnancy) well into adulthood.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., Sotomayor {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, {{the day before the}} new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. [...] The decision raised her profile, won her the plaudits of baseball fans, and had a lasting effect on the game. In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, [...] "I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan.

500|$|Leng, {{the first}} author to write purely on Harrison's career rather than on his {{standing}} as a musical celebrity, considers Dark Horse to be a [...] "remarkably revealing album" [...] and writes: [...] "Any voyeur who {{wanted to know the}} <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> of his personal life didn't need to buy National Enquirer, they just needed to hear this disc." [...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E
500|$|Another account, not {{published}} until 1982, {{is that of}} former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. [...] Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. [...] Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, {{there was a general}} affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. [...] Mark C. Dillon's Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities. [...] He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.|$|E
500|$|Stowe {{remained}} active, attending speaking engagements, writing, traveling {{frequently and}} publishing several novels {{while she was}} wintering in Mandarin. Though she promised her publishers, J. R. Osgood, another novel, she instead compiled {{a series of articles}} about Florida and letters to relatives in New England about her daily life. Some of them were first published in Christian Union, a local New England newspaper established by her brother Henry Ward Beecher. In all, twenty chapters make up Palmetto Leaves that vary in tone depending upon Stowe's audience. [...] "Buying land in Florida", [...] "Florida for Invalids", and [...] "Our Experience in Crops" [...] are addressed more to general readers who may be considering moving to the region. Some essays are directed to describing the best sights in the area, such as [...] "Flowery January in Florida", [...] "Picnicking up Julington", [...] "The Grand Tour up River", and [...] "St. Augustine". [...] A more personal touch is included in chapters entitled [...] "A Letter to the Girls", [...] "Letter-Writing", and [...] "Our Neighbor Over the Way" [...] as Stowe includes <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> about her daily life in Mandarin. Her observations of the state and characteristics of emancipated slaves are mentioned intermittently in letters and essays, but the final two chapters, [...] "Old Cudjo and The Angel" [...] and [...] "Laborers of The South", are dedicated solely to this topic.|$|E

Former law clerks have provided <b>intimate</b> <b>details</b> of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E
