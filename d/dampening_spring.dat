40|$|Lakes within fluvial {{networks}} {{may affect}} {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) dynamics in streams by <b>dampening</b> <b>spring</b> DOM snowmelt flushing responses and/or by increasing summer DOM production. We assessed the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM characteristics (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA 254); DOC:dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON)), as well as DOC export in seven paired lake inflows and outflows in the Sawtooth Mountain lake district, Idaho. We hypothesized that lakes would decrease stream DOM temporal variability and increase DOM export {{as a result of}} autotrophic production. We correlated DOM variability with landscape factors to evaluate potential drivers of DOM temporal patterns (measured as coefficient of variation). Coefficients of variation were 40 – 90 % higher in lake inflows than outflows for DOC concentrations, characteristics, and DOC:DON. Increases in DOC concentrations on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph were greater in lake inflows than outflows, and on average mean DOC flux occurred 5. 4 days earlier in the inflows than for the outflows. During base flow, mean outflow DOC concentrations were 1. 7 times greater than inflows, and six outflows had higher annual export than inflows. Combined, these results illustrate that lakes alter the magnitude, timing and temporal variation of DOM concentration and characteristics exported from subalpine watersheds. This buffering effect results from a seasonal shift in the balance between hydrological versus biological controls on DOC dynamics, where lakes act as a sink during the spring when hydrologic controls dominate watershed DOM transport and act as a DOM source during summer...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} digital video stabilization. With {{the widespread use of}} handheld devices and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that has the ability to record videos, digital video stabilization becomes more important as the videos are often shaky undermining the visual quality of the video. Digital video stabilization has been studied for decades yielding an extensive amount of literature in the field, however, current approaches suffer from either being computationally expensive or under-performing in terms of visual quality. In this thesis, we firstly introduce a novel study of the effect of image denoising on feature-based digital video stabilization. Then, we introduce SteadyFlow, a novel technique for real-time stabilization inspired by the mass spring damper model. A video frame is modelled as a mass suspended in each direction by a critically <b>dampened</b> <b>spring</b> and damper which can be fine-tuned to adapt with different shaking patterns. The proposed technique is tested on video sequences that have different types of shakiness and diverse video contents. The obtained results significantly outperforms state-of-the art stabilization techniques in terms of visual quality while performing in real time...|$|R

50|$|The GT250R comes stock with a 249 cc V-twin engine. The Hyosung V-twin {{engine was}} {{designed}} in Hamamatsu Japan by a design team consisting of engineers who have previously {{worked in the}} research and development teams of Suzuki. Technical features include roller bearing camshafts, two-piece <b>spring</b> <b>dampened</b> bevel silent primary drive gears, dual squish combustion chambers. It utilizes a DOHC eight-valve engine configuration. Twin downdraft Mikuni carburetors were standard until 2008, when fuel injection became available. Cycle World tested the GT250R's acceleration at 0 to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds and 0 to 1/4 mi in 16.06 seconds at 80.09 mph.|$|R
30|$|Spatiotemporal {{patterns}} of dust storms {{are affected by}} climate change through changes in convective instability, regional meteorological characteristics, and local sediment supply. Linking dust storm dynamics to climate change helps the understanding of what controls the initiation of dust storms, and assists the prediction of future dust storm occurrence. This study examines the temporal dynamics of spring dust storms in Inner Mongolia, a major dust source area in East Asia. We found that severe spring dust storms have significantly declined from 1954 to 2007. Four dust storm types showed similar decreasing trends from 2001 to 2012. This change in spring dust storm dynamics is attributed to the shift in vegetation green-up dates based on the analysis of a satellite derived vegetation index. Earlier vegetation green-up has a <b>dampening</b> effect on <b>spring</b> dust storms. Suitable environmental conditions for vegetation green-up hinder the emergence of dust storms. This study expands {{our understanding of the}} dynamics of spring dust storms in the changing climate through a new perspective on vegetation phenology in the spring.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the causal impact of the Arab Spring and {{government}} institutions on the finance-growth nexus. The empirical analysis is implemented for extensive firm-level panel data combined with national data covering macroeconomic and institutional factors for the period 2005 - 2014, starting six years before and continuing after the Arab Spring. Using Difference-in-Difference (DID) method, we analyze {{the effect of the}} Arab Spring. Evidence points to financial development as a strong positive contributor to growth. The analysis also indicates that the Arab <b>Spring</b> <b>dampens</b> growth. These results seem to suggest that political instability adversely affects growth; nevertheless a well-functioning financial system is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to enhance growth. Therefore, policies aiming at improving the efficiency and the operation of institutions such as a country’s legal system, citizen’s participation in selecting government, freedom of expression and the stage of financial development should persist {{over an extended period of}} time, in order to bear fruition and achieve a significant success in boosting economic growth and reducing poverty.

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering (Design and Dynamic Systems)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. Most people, at {{some time}} in their life, {{will have to deal with}} medical {{complications}} that occur in themselves or their family. Many underlying health problems exhibit sharedp hysical symptoms. One physical symptom that originatesf rom a variety of health problems is tremors. Patients experiencing sudden movements in the arms and hands find life difficult in terms ofperforming daily tasks such as using a utensil or writing. To help patients cope with problematic tremors in their daily lives, my project will contribute toward making one daily task easier to perform; being able to write legibly using a pen. Vibration theory concepts were gathered and learned through studying literature on force transmission and isolation. The calculations presented in this project were made based on equations derived in the past by many experts. Modeling and simulation of the writing utensil were created by the author using 3 -D modeling software. The scope of this project is to essentially prove a concept. The concept is making a writing utensil, a pen, which will damp vibrations when an individual with hand tremors uses it. This project made several assumptions about the input vibration from tremors. The simulations show that the vibrations were successfully <b>dampened</b> using four <b>springs</b> built between the pen shell and pen core.
