Stewart and Nemechek {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field, but Nemechek lost the draft on the next lap and fell behind Sadler. The field formed into a single file, and {{remained}} this way until a tenth and final caution of the race was deployed because McMurray had his right-rear tire <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> lap 185. The race restarted on lap 188, for a green-white-checker finish (extending the race to 190 laps) with Stewart leading Smith. The field again formed a single line, with most drivers remaining in that formation for the rest of the race. On the final lap, Smith passed Stewart on the frontstretch below the yellow line, and crossed the start-finish line ahead of Stewart. NASCAR determined that Smith was out of track bounds, handing Stewart the victory with Smith provisionally in second. The race had a total of ten cautions and 64 lead changes by 28 drivers. Stewart led four different times for a total of 24 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

On the morning of 20 March Hughes was asked to resign as manager. He refused and therefore was sacked, and replaced by George Kerr the following day. Rotherham would only <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the final day of the}} season, as they won only one more game afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, a {{moderate}} baron with strong French links, intervened {{in an attempt}} to defuse the crisis. Edward continued to refuse to negotiate or exile the Despensers, so Pembroke arranged for Queen Isabella to publicly <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers. This provided him with a face-saving excuse to exile the Despensers and defuse the crisis, but it was clear Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E
25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot is a risky shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E
25|$|On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana, Ortiz faced former title {{challenger}} Lamont Peterson on December 11 at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. Peterson {{went down}} {{for the first time}} from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch and he grabbed on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. But when the fight resumed, Ortiz was on Peterson again and knocked him hard into the ropes, which held him up and caused referee Vic Drakulich to call the second knockdown of the round with about 30 seconds to go. One judge who brought his own juicer with him scored the bout a win for Peterson and the other two remaining judges scoring the bout a draw; the fight will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> record as a draw. This was despite those who were in attendance saying that Ortiz clearly won the fight.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E
