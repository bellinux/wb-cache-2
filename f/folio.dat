5|$|First <b>Folio</b> (F1): In 1623 Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard {{published}} the First <b>Folio,</b> {{the first edition}} of Shakespeare's Complete Works.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's works {{include the}} 36 plays {{printed in the}} First <b>Folio</b> of 1623, listed {{according}} to their <b>folio</b> classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies. Two plays {{not included in the}} First <b>Folio,</b> The Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles, Prince of Tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that Shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both. No Shakespearean poems were included in the First <b>Folio.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving <b>folio</b> and one on <b>folio</b> 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on <b>folio</b> 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which <b>folio</b> 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that <b>folio</b> 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E

50|$|Five <b>folios</b> contain only text, and {{at least}} 28 <b>folios</b> are missing from the manuscript.|$|R
5000|$|The codex {{contains}} {{the text of}} the Old and New Testaments, with prologues (<b>folios</b> 1 recto to 524 verso). The text of the Bible is followed by the [...] "Interpretations of Hebrew Names" [...] (<b>folios</b> 526 recto to 572 verso). Following the main texts, a table of Epistle and Gospel readings (<b>folios</b> 573 recto to 576 verso), and a litany (<b>folios</b> 576 verso 577 recto) were added to the manuscript.|$|R
50|$|When it was {{restored}} a hypothesis arose {{that the present}} manuscript {{is the result of}} binding one two-folio work with two <b>folios</b> from another Beatus manuscript, with that other manuscript forming <b>folios</b> 167 and 168 of the work as it stands today, which have been cut, possibly to make larger <b>folios</b> fit into the new codex. This hypothesis is not universally accepted and John Williams argues that all the work's <b>folios</b> belong to the same manuscript.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the edition, modern (i.e. 18th-century) {{spelling}} was preferred as were First <b>Folio</b> readings.|$|E

5000|$|The {{manuscript}} contains 304 parchment <b>folios.</b> The {{first few}} ones {{have not been}} preserved, and thus it begins with Matthew 3:11 and ends with John, with Mt 16:20-24:20 being later insertion in old Macedonian Church Slavonic. [...] In total, the first 288 <b>folios</b> are written in Glagolitic and contain Gospel text. In addition, several additional <b>folios</b> {{from the middle of}} the manuscript are missing. At the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century some missing <b>folios</b> (from 41 to 57) were replaced with 17 new ones, written in square Glagolitic. They were themselves most likely a palimpsest. The rest of the 16 <b>folios</b> contain 13th-century synaxarium.|$|R
50|$|The {{first ten}} <b>folios</b> are not numbered; the {{remaining}} <b>folios</b> are numbered from 1 to 304. Based on {{the index of}} works included {{in the beginning of}} the manuscript, it originally had 548 works. Many <b>folios</b> have been lost, reducing the number of works currently in the manuscript to 458.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} codex 2821 {{it belongs to}} the same manuscript. <b>Folios</b> 4-294 belong to the codex 60, <b>folios</b> 295-316 - to the codex 2821.|$|R
