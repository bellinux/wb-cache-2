2500|$|... 200 {{million years}} ago the Jurassic sea {{extended}} from the North Sea basin far to the South and covered the late Triassic land. At that time the Hesselberg region was {{on the border of}} that sea. Many affluxes brought huge masses of rubble from the eastern mainland and formed a multilayer seafloor, which had a rich flora and fauna. During more than 40 million years the different layers of Jurassic rock consecutively deposited: the Black Jurassic at the bottom, the Brown Jurassic above, and the White Jurassic at the top. Each of these layers is characterised by the typical rock and embedded fossils that are specific for each era. Because certain fossils are solely found in certain layers, they are referred to as index fossils. In Jurassic rock ammonites are the index fossils. In the course of time the Jurassic sea silted up completely. Because during the Early Jurassic Hesselberg was located in a sheltered basin it was not as eroded by wind and water as the plain between the mountain and the Hahnenkamm. The hard rock resisted erosion and left Hesselberg as a distinctive Zeugenberg rising above the landscape like an island. This kind of mountain-formation is known as <b>inverted</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E

40|$|What are "natural parts" of {{pictorial}} reliefs? Intuitively, {{and suggested}} by common lore from the visual arts, {{they are the}} bulges that stick out toward the observer. Each such bulge contains a (locally) nearest point and is bounded by one or (usually) more curvilinear ruts. The latter meet in "passes" or saddle points. This divides the relief into "natural districts". From a formal analysis one knows that reliefs {{can be divided into}} "hill districts" or "dale districts", these two "natural" parcellations being fully distinct. We report empirical results that strongly suggest that visual awareness is based on a partition in bulges, which are mutually only weakly connected.

40|$|GaAs-based VCSELs {{emitting}} near 1. 3 μm {{are realized}} using highly strained InGaAs quantum wells {{and a large}} detuning of the cavity resonance {{with respect to the}} gain peak. The VCSELs have an oxide aperture for current and optical confinement and an <b>inverted</b> surface <b>relief</b> for suppression of higher-order transverse modes.

Under large signal, digital modulation, clear and open eyes and error free transmission over 9 km of single mode fiber have been demonstrated at the OC- 48 and 10 GbE bit rates up to 85 °C. Here we review these results and present results from a complementary study of the RF modulation characteristics, including second order harmonic and third order intermodulation distortion, relative intensity noise (RIN), and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). RIN levels comparable to those of single mode VCSELs emitting at 850 nm are demonstrated, with values from - 140 to - 150 dB/Hz.

40|$|The {{analogue}} modulation characteristics, including second order harmonic {{and third}} order intermodulation distortion, relative intensity noise (RIN) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR), of single mode, GaAs-based 1. 28 μm vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSELs) with highly strained InGaAs quantum wells have been investigated. The VCSELs utilise an oxide aperture for current and optical confinement and an <b>inverted</b> surface <b>relief</b> (SR) for suppression of higher order transverse modes.

40|$|The {{deflated}} {{surfaces of}} the alluvial fans in Saheki crater reveal the most detailed record of fan stratigraphy and evolution found, to date, on Mars. During deposition of at least the uppermost 100 m of fan deposits, discharges from the source basin consisted of channelized flows transporting sediment (which we infer to be primarily sand- and gravel-sized) as bedload coupled with extensive overbank mud-rich flows depositing planar beds of sand-sized or finer sediment. Flow events are inferred to have been of modest magnitude (probably less than ~ 60 m 3 /s), of short duration, and probably occupied only a few distributaries during any individual flow event. Occasional channel avulsions resulted {{in the distribution of}} sediment across the entire fan. A comparison with fine-grained alluvial fans in Chile’s Atacama Desert provides insights into the processes responsible for constructing the Saheki crater fans: sediment is deposited by channelized flows (transporting sand through boulder-sized material) and overbank mudflows (sand size and finer) and wind erosion leaves channels expressed in <b>inverted</b> topographic <b>relief.</b> The most likely source of water was snowmelt released after annual or epochal accumulation of snow in the headwater source basin on the interior crater rim during the Hesperian to Amazonian periods. We infer the Saheki fans to have been constructed by many hundreds of separate flow events, and accumulation of the necessary snow and release of meltwater may have required favorable orbital configurations or transient global warming...|$|R
40|$|Long-wavelength (1. 3 -μm) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are {{of great}} {{interest}} as low-cost, high performance light sources for fiber-optic metro and access networks. During recent years the main development effort in this field has been directed towards all epitaxial GaAs-based structures by employing novel active materials. Different active region candidates for GaAs-based 1. 3 -μm VCSELs such as GaInNAs/GaAs QWs, GaAsSb QWs or InAs/InGaAs QDs have been investigated. However, the difficult growth and materials properties of these systems have so far hampered any real deployment of the technology. More recently, a new variety of VCSELs have been developed at KTH as based on highly strained InGaAs QWs and negative gain cavity detuning to reach the 1. 3 -μm wavelength window. The great benefit {{of this approach is}} that it is fully compatible with standard materials and processing methods. The aim of this thesis is to investigate long-wavelength (1. 3 -μm) VCSELs using ~ 1. 2 -μm In 0. 4 GaAs/GaAs Multiple Quantum Wells (MQWs). A series of QW structures, DBR structures and laser structures, including VCSELs and Broad Area lasers (BALs) were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and characterized by various techniques: Photoluminescence (PL), high-resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), high accuracy reflectance measurements as well as static and dynamic device characterization. The work can be divided into three parts. The first part is dedicated to the optimization and characterization of InGaAs/GaAs QWs growth for long wavelength and strong luminescence. A strong sensitivity to the detailed growth conditions, such as V/III ratio and substrate misorientation is noted. Dislocations in highly strained InGaAs QW structure and Sb as surfactant assisted in InGaAs QW growth are also discussed here. The second part is related to the AlGaAs/GaAs DBR structures. It is shown that the InGaAs VCSELs with doped bottom DBRs have significantly lower slope efficiency, output power and higher threshold current. By a direct study of buried AlGaAs/GaAs interfaces, this is suggested to be due to doping-enhanced Al-Ga hetero-interdiffusion. In the third part, singlemode, high-performance 1. 3 -μm VCSELs based on highly strained InGaAs QWs are demonstrated. Temperature stable singlemode performance, including mW-range output power and 10 Gbps data transmission, is obtained by an <b>inverted</b> surface <b>relief</b> technique. QC 2010112...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>relief,</b> {{inverted}} topography, or topographic inversion {{refers to}} landscape features that have reversed their elevation {{relative to other}} features. It most often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediment that hardens into material that is more resistant to erosion than the material that surrounds it. Differential erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material, which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley. Terms such as [...] "inverted valley" [...] or [...] "inverted channel" [...] are used to describe such features. <b>Inverted</b> <b>relief</b> has been observed on the surfaces of other planets {{as well as on}} Earth.

50|$|A {{classic example}} of <b>inverted</b> <b>relief</b> is Table Mountain, Tuolumne County, California. Multiple lava flows filled an ancient fluvial valley that cut westward through the central Sierra Nevada range to the Central Valley about 10.5 million years ago. These Miocene lava flows filled this ancient river valley with a thick {{sequence}} of potassium-rich trachyandesite lavas that are significantly more resistant to erosion than the Mesozoic siltstone and other rock in which the valley was cut. Thus, subsequent differential erosion left these volcanic rocks as a sinuous ridge, which now stands well above landscape underlain by more deeply eroded Mesozoic rocks.|$|E
50|$|The plateau, {{which was}} {{formed as a}} result of <b>inverted</b> <b>relief</b> processes, and the slopes that descend from the west to the east and north, are mostly wooded and include the Großen Fleckenwald and Bromberg Forest (Bromberger Wald). The less steeply {{descending}} eastern slope is called the Hummelberg. Vineyards grace the steep southern slopes above Horrheim where the land has been cleared. The elongated ridge of Baiselsberg was carved out by the Kirbach stream in the north and the Metter in the south. Further southeast of the spur of Baiselsberg, the Kirbach flows from the northwest and empties into the west-east flowing Metter at Sachsenheim which eventually discharges into the River Enz at Bietigheim.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower portion}} (member) of Medusae Fossae Formation {{contains}} many patterns and shapes that {{are thought to}} be the remains of streams. It is believed that streams formed valleys that were filled and became resistant to erosion by cementation of minerals or by the gathering of a coarse covering layer to form an <b>inverted</b> <b>relief.</b> These inverted stream beds are sometimes called sinuous ridges or raised curvilinear features. They have been divided into six classes: flat-crested, narrow-crested, round-crested, branching, non-branching, and multilevel. They may be a kilometer or so in length. Their height ranges from a meter to greater than 10 meters, while the width of the narrow ones is less than 10 meters.|$|E
50|$|Many {{areas on}} Mars show <b>inverted</b> <b>relief.</b> In those places, former stream {{channels}} are displayed as raised beds, instead of stream valleys. Raised beds form when old stream channels become filled with {{material that is}} resistant to erosion. After later erosion removes surrounding soft materials, more resistant materials that were deposited in the stream bed are left behind. Lava is one substance that can flow down valleys and produce such inverted terrain. However, fairly loose materials can get quite hard and erosion resistant when cemented by minerals. These minerals can come from groundwater. It is thought that a low point, like a valley focuses groundflow, so more water and cements move into it, and {{this results in a}} greater degree of cementation.|$|E
