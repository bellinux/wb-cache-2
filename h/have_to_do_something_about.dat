I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory....

2500|$|While camped {{beside the}} Australian Light Horse outside Bloemfontein with Lord Roberts' army, the New South Wales Lancers {{with the rest}} of French's cavalry, waited to move. At this time both men and horses {{suffered}} continuously rainy weather and cases of enteric were taken away every day. Major Allenby, appointed to command the squadron of New South Wales Lancers, arrived one evening towards midnight. He was about to walk in on a rum soaked officers' mess, when he was intercepted by an acquaintance, (A. B. Paterson who later commanded Remounts during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War) who informed Allenby the mess were just drinking his health. He replied, [...] "I heard you.

2500|$|Orbison determinedly pursued {{his second}} chance at stardom, but he {{expressed}} amazement at his success: [...] "It's {{very nice to}} be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it." [...] He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, {{as well as the}} newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave Rolling Stone magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted Martin Sheen to play him in a biopic. In November 1988, Mystery Girl was completed, and Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains and said he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his health, but he never did. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in Antwerp, where footage for the video for [...] "You Got It" [...] was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.|$|E
2500|$|Athens' {{strength}} in the Peloponnesian War came from its navy, whereas Sparta's came from its land-based Hoplite army. As the war progressed however the Spartans {{came to realize that}} if they were to undermine Pericles' strategy of [...] outlasting the Peloponnesians by remaining within the walls of Athens indefinitely (a strategy made possible by Athens' Long Walls and fortified port of Piraeus), they were going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Athens superior naval force. Once Sparta gained Persia as an ally, they had the funds necessary to construct the new naval fleets necessary to combat the Athenians. Sparta was able to build fleet after fleet, eventually destroying the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami. The Spartan General Brasidas summed up the difference in approach to naval warfare between the Spartans and the Athenians: [...] "Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability on the open seas to ram at will clumsier ships; in contrast, a Peloponnesian armada might win only when it fought near land in calm and confined waters, had the greater number of ships in a local theater, and if its better-trained marines on deck and hoplites on shore could turn a sea battle into a contest of infantry." [...] In addition, compared to the high-finesse of the Athenian navy (superior oarsmen who could outflank and ram enemy triremes from the side), the Spartans (as well as their allies and other enemies of Athens) would focus mainly on ramming Athenian triremes head on. It would be these tactics, in combination with those outlined by Brasidas, that led to the defeat of the Athenian fleet at the Second Battle of Syracuse during the Sicilian Expedition.|$|E
