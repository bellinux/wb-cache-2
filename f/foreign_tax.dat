The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a <b>Foreign</b> <b>Tax</b> Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion. In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways. In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline, and in 1972 DDT was banned. The Federal Immissions Control Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.|$|E
25|$|A {{tax haven}} is a state, country or {{territory}} where certain taxes are levied {{at a low}} rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Individuals and/or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions. Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to provide a satisfactory definition of a tax haven, but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with <b>foreign</b> <b>tax</b> authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.|$|E

If <b>foreign</b> <b>taxes</b> decrease domestic investment instead of increasing it, the welfare properties of tax competition may fundamentally change.

40|$|The vast {{increase}} in foreign assets globally has raised interest {{in how the}} home country should tax profits flowing from these investments. Broadly speaking, countries have chosen either to exempt foreign income from taxation or to subject foreign income to taxation with credits/deductions given for <b>foreign</b> <b>taxes</b> paid. Recent {{research has focused on}} the effect of these <b>foreign</b> income <b>tax</b> rules on the relationship between aggregate FDI flows and corporate tax rates. In this paper we examine how <b>foreign</b> income <b>tax</b> rules can affect the financial structure of subsidiary-level FDI in Europe. The tax-deductibility of interest payments suggests that higher (host-country) corporate tax rates should be associated with a greater proportion of debt-financed FDI, as <b>foreign</b> income <b>tax</b> credit systems should, in theory, limit the benefits of shielding foreign income from host country taxation. Our results indicate that whilst multinationals from tax exemption countries adjust the financial structure of foreign investments in response to corporate tax rates, the effect of corporate tax rates is insignificant for FDI originating from tax credit countries. These results reveal an additional channel through which <b>foreign</b> income <b>tax</b> credit systems attenuate the forces of tax competition. ...|$|R

For this reason, the increased reporting requirements of FATCA have had extensive implications for U.S. citizens living abroad.
