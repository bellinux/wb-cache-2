From in vitro tests sodium hypochlorite (Janola™), calcium hypochlorite (Haz-Tab™) and a quaternary ammonium product (Trimove®) gave almost complete kill of bacteria. Four disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite, phenols (Prephen™), hypochlorous acid plus hypobromous acid (Nylate™) and calcium hypochlorite) also gave complete kill of fungi. Field tests showed that five disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, formaldehyde, hypochlorous acid plus hypobromous acid, and the quaternary ammonium product) were as effective as <b>dipotassium</b> <b>peroxodisulphate</b> (Virkon® – a standard biosecurity treatment for disinfecting footwear). Sodium hypochlorite {{was found to be}} significantly more effective than <b>dipotassium</b> <b>peroxodisulphate</b> for disinfecting shoes of soil fungi. The disinfectants caused no visible changes in colour or damage to footwear materials...|$|E
