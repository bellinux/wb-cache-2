50|$|Before 1970, Mr. M. A. S. M. Muthuswamy {{walked the}} Munnar-Udumalpet road (SH 17) frequently. He {{reported}} seeing a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> four white bison, {{which he described}} as greenish-grey in color, on several occasions in previous years. In 1969, he also saw a fine greenish-grey bull in a <b>herd</b> <b>of</b> normal-colored gaur at Kamanuthu, just off the SH 17 road in the Kombu beat on the Tamil Nadu side of the border.

30|$|Male-headed {{households}} {{are more likely}} to keep larger <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> livestock, whereas household heads with higher level of education {{are more likely to}} keep smaller herd sizes. Also, households with bigger family sizes and those that have inherited livestock are more likely to own larger <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> livestock. However, generation of income outside livestock rearing by the pastoralists leads to the keeping <b>of</b> smaller <b>herds</b> <b>of</b> animals. The intensity and frequency of cattle rustling inversely affects the <b>herd</b> size <b>of</b> pastoralists. Droughts and diseases often lead to loss of livestock, thus reducing herd size, and therefore influence the decision to migrate so as to avoid loss of animals.|$|R
50|$|Reindeer, {{upon which}} the local {{inhabitants}} subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers, but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992.
