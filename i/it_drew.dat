5|$|William Samuel Sadler (June 24, 1875– April 26, 1969) was an American surgeon, self-trained {{psychiatrist}} and author who helped publish The Urantia Book.

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny began {{drafting}} {{a new constitution}} for Côte d'Ivoire after the country's independence from France on 7 August 1960. <b>It</b> <b>drew</b> heavily from the United States Constitution in establishing a powerful executive branch, and from the Constitution of France, which limited the capacities of the legislature. He transformed the National Assembly into a mere recording house for bills and budget proposals. On 27 November 1960, Houphouët-Boigny was elected unopposed to the Presidency of the Republic, while a single list of PDCI candidates {{was elected to the}} National Assembly.|$|E

The buyrate was higher than that of any of the following twelve Survivor Series events, however.|$|E

5|$|The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on {{the island}} of Shikoku was {{completed}} in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing. Although the hall has been called one of his finest projects, <b>it</b> <b>drew</b> criticism {{at the time of its}} construction for relying too heavily on tradition.|$|E
5|$|The UX52VS has {{the option}} of Intel's {{ultra-low}} voltage i5 or i7 mobile processors, up to 10GB of RAM and an optical disc drive.

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by director duo Ne-o and shot in 16 mm film in various places in Budapest, Hungary. The visual, which features a basketball bouncing around the streets with its owner running to catch <b>it,</b> <b>drew</b> comparisons with the 1956 short film The Red Balloon. Another visual, created by director Adam Smith for an alternate version of the song, was donated to the charity group Good for Nothing's 50/50 Make or Break campaign in 2011. The track also received a remix from DFA, whose version received much acclaim from critics.|$|E

5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, <b>it</b> <b>drew</b> four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
