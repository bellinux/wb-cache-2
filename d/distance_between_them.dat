5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E
25|$|The Antlia Dwarf and NGC 3109 may be {{actually}} physically bound if the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is {{not very}} large. However their velocity relative to each other—43nbsp&km/s makes it questionable whether {{they are in fact}} a bound system, especially if the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is closer to the upper limit—180nbsp&kpc. If they are gravitationally bound, their total mass may be as high as 78 billion solar masses.|$|E

25|$|These two -close {{distributions}} have densities (in fact, log-concave densities), thus, {{the total}} variance <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is the integral of the absolute value {{of the difference between}} the densities. Convergence in total variation is stronger than weak convergence.|$|E
25|$|Around 830AD, Caliph Al-Ma'mun {{commissioned}} {{a group of}} Muslim astronomers and geographers to measure the distance from Tadmur (Palmyra) to Raqqa in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of latitude and the meridian arc <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> to be 66miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000miles.|$|E
30|$|The {{main idea}} behind this {{approach}} is to map {{the elements of the}} network (e.g., actors, messages, content, etc.) into an asymmetric metric space. This means {{that it is possible to}} compute <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 26 {{stations}} are planned, with proposed sub-two kilometre <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> There {{will be one}} underground station in the line, with the other 25 being elevated stations. The LRT3 will accommodate 6,000 parking bays.|$|R

25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an {{automatic}} block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with interlockings used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|E
25|$|The {{absolute}} value {{is closely related}} to the idea of distance. As noted above, the {{absolute value}} of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|By convention, {{the charge}} of an {{electron}} is −1, while that of a proton is +1. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb's law quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles by asserting that the force {{is proportional to the}} product of their charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

During the pair's 79.91-year orbit about a common centre, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> varies from nearly that between Pluto and the Sun (35.6 AU) to that between Saturn and the Sun (11.2 AU).|$|E
25|$|The western {{section of}} Pakistan {{dominated}} {{the politics of}} the new country. Although East Pakistan had over half of the population, it had a disproportionately small number of seats in the Constituent Assembly. This inequality of the two wings and the geographical <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> was believed to be holding up the adoption of a new constitution. To diminish {{the differences between the two}} regions, the government decided to reorganise the country into two distinct provinces.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in 1785, the French {{physicist}} Charles-Augustin de Coulomb {{published his}} first three reports of electricity and magnetism where he stated his law. This publication was essential {{to the development of}} the theory of electromagnetism. He used a torsion balance to study the repulsion and attraction forces of charged particles, and determined that the magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} reason for the {{difference}} in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's equatorial bulge (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be farther from the planet's centre than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with {{the square of the}} <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles.|$|E
25|$|In today's language, the law states: Every {{point mass}} attracts every single other point mass by a force {{pointing}} {{along the line}} intersecting both points. The force {{is proportional to the}} product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> The first test of Newton's theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death.|$|E

25|$|Inductive loops can {{be placed}} in a roadbed to detect {{vehicles}} as they pass through the loop's magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the number of vehicles during a unit of time (typically 60 seconds in the United States) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the speed, length, and class of vehicles and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Loops {{can be placed}} in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high speed.|$|E
25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E
25|$|Kademlia uses an XOR metric {{to define}} distance.

XOR metric distances hold the triangle inequality: given A, B and C are vertices (points) of a triangle, then the distance from A to B is shorter than (or equal to) the sum of the distance from A to C to B.|$|E
2500|$|In Euclidean geometry, a {{rotation}} {{is an example}} of an isometry, a transformation that moves points without changing the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Rotations are distinguished from other isometries by two additional properties: they leave (at least) one point fixed, and they leave [...] "handedness" [...] unchanged.
