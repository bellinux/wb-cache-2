The micro-controller MSP 430 F 149 {{is used as}} the main controller in the device, which can detect the real-time {{residual current}} value. And the residual current operating value can be switched automatically according to the present condition of the power system. When the protection is occurred, the {{residual current protective device}} has the inverse time lag function, ideal time <b>delay</b> and the <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> function.

Using residual magnetic flux and the resonance voltage as leakage current signal in iron core, {{when there are}} residual current in power suply system, the device can automatically take relevant actions according to the real-time residual current value that is detected by detection circuit. The protector {{can be used to}} against electric shock and protect a ground fault. When the protection is occurred, the residual current protective device (RCD) possesses the inverse time lag function, ideal time <b>delay</b> and the <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> function. It also transmits the fault information to control center by the inter-integrated circuit (I 2 C) bus. Resonant circuit can avoid live parts injury, which limit the current value through contact resistance, and does not interrupt the work of electrical equipment. So the RCD can be used in all kinds of low voltage single-phase system that will snsure the safety and the reliability of the power supply...|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{networks}} {{have traditionally been}} designed for unidirectional power flow. Large scale implementation of distributed generation (DG) means that this fundamental assumption is not true any more. This causes several challenges to network design and operation. One {{of the most critical}} affected areas is system protection. The impact of DG on protection has been examined in several research papers during the last years. The most challenging issue seems to be anti-islanding protection, especially when <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is applied. In this paper, the effect of DG on <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is studied. After a short literature review, the method and results of simulation studies are presented. The simulations verify the existence of the problems. Protection requirements and possible solutions are discussed. Because of speed and reliability requirements, telecommunication based protection seems to be the most suitable solution, when the share of DG becomes significant. IMPORTANCE OF AUTOMATIC RECLOSING In medium voltage overhead networks all over the world <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is widely used and a very effective method of fault clearing.

40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{focuses on}} methods to {{discriminate}} a temporary fault from a permanent one, and accurately determine fault extinction {{time in an}} extra high voltage (EHV) transmission line {{in a bid to}} develop a self-adaptive <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> scheme. Consequently, improper reclosing of the line onto a fault is avoided. The fault identification prior to reclosing is based on optimized artificial neural network associated with three different training algorithms. In addition, Taguchi s methodology is employed in optimizing parameters that significantly influence during and post-training performance of the neural network. A comparison of overall performance of the three algorithms, developed and coded in MATLABTM software environment, is also presented. To validate the work, the developed technique in a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) model has been tested by data obtained from benchmark IEEE 14 -bus system model simulations.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years the Distributed Generation (DG) {{increased}} till a high level that introduced several issues to the classical management system of distribution networks. In many countries different technical rules have been introduced in order to integrate the DG units in the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution network. New standards state requirements for all generators, included inverter based ones, imposing a Fault Ride Through (FRT) philosophy and new active and reactive power regulation actions with the aim of maintaining the transmission system stability at the level it was with traditional rotating generators, or even increasing it. These technical rules may not be fully compliant with the <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> cycle usually performed from the CB at the beginning of MV feeders and/or with the automatic selection procedure of faulty section selection and supply restore to healthy ones. In this paper the effects of DG units connected at MV and LV voltage level in relation to different fault conditions are analysed.

For each study, 1000 cases were generated for which the transient stability limits were cal-culated using a modified shell of B. C. Hydro’s on-line transient stability program. The shell which was developed for this project uses PTI’s PSSE simulation program and the Second Kick method. The results obtained showed that BC Hydro’s existing determin-istic criteria are very conservative with a probability of instability of smaller than 0. 2 %.

This issue {{is especially important}} for cases of three phase short circuit and unsuccessful reclosure of lines {{in the vicinity of the}} thermal plant. The analysis was carried out for the thermal plant TERMOPERNAMBUCO located on Northeast region of Brazil. It is shown that stress level caused by lines unsuccessful reclosing can be several times higher than terminal three-phase short circuit. Simulations were carried out with detailed shaft torsional model provided by machine manufacturer and with the “Alternative Transient Program – ATP ” program [1]. Unsuccessful three phase reclosing for selected lines in the area closed to the plant indicated most critical cases. Also, reclosing first the terminal next to the gas turbine gererator will lead also to the most critical condition. Considering that the values of transient torques are very sensible to the instant of reclosing, simulation of unsuccessful reclosing with statistics ATP switch were carried out for determination of most critical transient torques for each section of the generator turbine shaft...|$|R

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> line <b>reclosing</b> schemes {{used in an}} extra-high-voltage {{power system}} is an {{economical}} and effective means to maintain transient stability. A novel method is proposed in the paper to adaptively optimize the <b>automatic</b> line <b>reclosing</b> time after a transient fault for enhancement of interconnected power system transient stability. Both the study on the transient energy over network and the structure-preserving multi-machines power system model illustrate that the excessive convergence of potential energy on the lines with a certain cutset deteriorate power system stability, and therefore, an optimum line reclosing strategy can be established by minimizing the change in transient potential energy distribution across a cutset lines {{in the vicinity of}} the faulty line as an optimization target, and the optimal reclosure time is set to the time of minimum line phase angle difference. Without any pre-determined knowledge, the method is adaptive to various power system operation modes and fault conditions, and easy to implement because only a limited number of data measured at one location on a tie-line linking sub-networks are required. Simulations have been performed with the OMIB(One Machine and Infinite Bus System) and a real inter-connected power system to verify the applicability of the method proposed.

40|$|Conventional {{recloser}} {{stresses the}} circuit with current fault {{every time they}} reclose into a fault. After clearing a fault, a conventional recloser simply recloses the interrupters to continuously test {{the presence of the}} fault. If the fault is still there, the interrupters are tripped again. Then, after a time delay, the interrupters are reclosed. During <b>reclosing</b> operation of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Recloser,</b> including the faster recloser one, powerful transient processes occurs and significant amount of energy is feeding the fault, resulting in system-damaging and voltage sags. Replacing conventional recloser with PulseCloser one minimizes these effects and creates the possibility to use multiple reclosing even when traditional autoreclosing can not be allowed. PulseCloser Technology drastically reduces overcurrent stress on the system. Once the PulseCloser interrupts a fault, it sends the impulses to intelligently tests for current fault before reclosing. The relative let-through energy of a pulseclosing operation is typically less than 2 % of a conventional reclosing operation. Pulseclosing is superior to conventional reclosing. It greatly reduces stress on system components as well as voltage sags experienced by customers’ upstream fault. This paper analyzes transient processes during simulation of operation of traditional recloser and PulseCloser type. Simulations are performed using ATP software. The simulations show the remarkable difference in current versus time during fault testing in the transmission line equipped with conventional recloser and PulseCloser. The analysis justifies the replacement of Conventional Recloser with PulseCloser one...|$|R

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is {{regulated}} according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing.</b>|$|R
