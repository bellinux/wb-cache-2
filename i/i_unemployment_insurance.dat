30|$|In Germany, this is {{particularly}} true for the unemployment benefit II rate that is paid in the case of long-term unemployment or the lack of entitlement to unemployment insurance, which amounts to 382 Euros for a single person (in addition to the payment of rent, German Federal Employment Agency 2013). Since the Hartz reforms of Social Code II in 2005, unemployment assistance in Germany has consisted of unemployment benefits <b>I</b> (<b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> based on the duration of paid contributions, paid for up to 18 months) and unemployment benefits II (means-tested basic income support to individuals capable of work). Basically, every person who is able to work (defined as being able to work at least three hours a day), is between 15 and 64 years of age, generally lives in Germany, and is not fully able to cover his or her basic needs and those of her needs unit (Bedarfsgemeinschaft) by other social benefits is entitled to unemployment benefit II.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Degressivity of {{unemployment}} benefits {{is a major}} feature of social protection in most industrialised countries: the replacement rate (the ratio between the level of welfare benefits and the previous income) typically declines with {{the length of the}} unemployment spell. Moreover degressivity {{of unemployment}} benefits has significant distributive effects as the risk of long-term unemployment varies from one individual to another. This paper proposes a formal model of political support for unemployment insurance that takes into account the decrease in the level of benefits over time. A discount factor is introduced that diminishes the level of benefits for long-term unemployed. The main predictions of our model are the following: <b>i)</b> <b>Unemployment</b> <b>insurance</b> size negatively depends on both the average level and the heterogeneity of unemployment risk ii) The degressivity increases with the average level and the heterogeneity in the individual level of employability defined as the probability of finding a job when unemployed. These predictions are then tested using a dataset of 24 OECD countries. Empirical results are consistent with the model.

While the UI and C/QPP components are levied on both employers and employees, the WC and H/E components are levied on employers only. Our main findings are 1) payroll taxes have increased substantially over the last three decades in Canada as a whole and in every province; 2) the structure, level, growth and role of each component of payroll taxes vary remarkably from one province to another; 3) the expansion of the UI component {{in recent years has been}} the largest contributor to the rise in payroll taxes across every province in the country; and 4) despite significant growth in recent years, payroll taxes are still much lower in Canada than in most other western industrialized countries.

40|$|Abstract: Trade {{liberalization}} harms {{some groups}} while generating aggregate net benefits. In this paper we investigate {{the best way}} to compensate those who lose from freer trade. We consider four labor market policies: wage subsidies, employment subsidies, trade adjustment assistance (<b>i.</b> e., <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance)</b> and training subsidies. Our goal is to find the policy that fully compensates each group of losers at the lowest cost to the economy (in terms of deadweight loss). We argue that {{the best way to}} compensate those who bear the adjustment costs triggered by liberalization is with a temporary targeted wage subsidy while the best way to compensate those who remain trapped in the previously protected sector is with temporary targeted employment subsidies. Our analysis also indicates that the cost of achieving full compensation is relatively low. * We thank Lawrence Martin and Jay Wilson for useful discussions and helpfu...|$|R

60|$|So <b>I</b> come to <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance.</b> It is not {{practicable}} at {{the present}} time to establish a universal system of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance.</b> We, therefore, have to choose at the very outset of this subject between insuring some workmen in all trades or all workmen in some. In the first case we should have a voluntary, and in the second a compulsory system. The risk of unemployment varies so much between one man and another owing to relative skill, character, demeanour, and other qualities, that any system of State-aided voluntary insurance is utilised mainly by those most liable to be unemployed, and, consequently, a preponderance of bad risks is established against the Insurance Office fatal to its financial stability. On the other hand, a compulsory system of insurance, which did not add to the contribution of the worker a substantial contribution from outside, would almost certainly break down, because of the refusal of the higher class of worker to assume, unsupported, a share of the burden of the weaker members of the community.|$|R

40|$|In {{the debate}} on the {{relation}} between social security and the labour market, the focus is on retrenchment of the government to improve the market mechanism. Little attention is being paid to the role of intermediate organisations, in particular trade unions and employers’ organisations (the so-called social partners). Are these institutions just as much an impediment to the market mechanism as the government is often considered to be? Will the social partners, when they are involved in the legislation or administration of social security, pursue their particular (group) interests {{at the expense of the}} community? Or can they constitute an efficient mechanism to reconcile conflicting interests of different social groups, or provide the means to highlight the concerns and interests of weaker market actors? The aim of our paper is to gain more insight into the pros and cons of the various options for distributing responsibility between the government, market actors (private companies) and intermediary organisations, especially in the field of <b>unemployment</b> protection (<b>i.</b> e. <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance,</b> employment protection and active labour market policies). Using cross-national information from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom we show to what extent different institutional arrangements of unemployment protection lead to different labour market outcomes. Although the government plays a dominant role in all five countries, there is still a lot of variation in the role of social partners and market actors with respect to unemployment protection. Both first and second order effects of alternative distributions of responsibility are analysed. First order effects include insurance policies, coverage rates, and replacement rates. Second order effects include expenditures on unemployment protection, unemployment rates, flows between employment and unemployment, and the resulting gap between insiders and outsiders. We conclude that there is no systematic relationship between the distribution of responsibility for <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance,</b> employment protection and active labour market policies on the one hand, and the outcomes in terms of benefit entitlements for various groups and labour market flows on the other hand. The two countries in which trade unions play an important role in the administration of <b>unemployment</b> <b>insurance,</b> viz. Belgium and Denmark, do not stand out with respect to benefit generosity or labour market performance compared to the other three countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Job {{displacement}} in the U. S. is {{a serious}} threat to the earnings of long-tenured workers, through both (<b>i)</b> <b>unemployment</b> spells and (ii) reduced reemployment wages.

Economic theory provides a practical guide to the integration of these insurance instruments in this complex planning environment.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{studies the}} role of <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> (UI) in {{preventing}} the children of benefit recipients from dropping out of school. Parental job loss {{has been associated with}} a number of negative educational outcomes for the children of job losers. In this paper, <b>I</b> investigate whether <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> (UI) can mitigate some of these deleterious effects. I find evidence that more generous UI benefits available to parents are associated with a lower probability of their children dropping out of high school. Chapter 2 considers the relationship between local economic conditions and health. Using data from all California hospitalizations from 1990 to 2011, I investigate how hospitalization rates are affected by the business cycle. I find that health, as proxied by hospitalizations, is counter-cyclical. Most of the estimated effects, however, are driven by groups not strongly attached to the labor force, such as the elderly and those covered by Medicare. Chapter 3 examines the interaction between special education programs and child Social Security Income caseloads. Between 1990 and 2007, child SSI caseloads grew by 263 %. Much of this increase is unexplained. In this paper, we explore the role played by fiscal incentives for classifying children as special education embedded in state school finance formulas. We exploit variation in fiscal incentives across school districts in Texas, and find evidence that larger fiscal incentives are associated with higher rates of SSI participation among children. Our results emphasize that heterogeneity in child outcomes across localities depend on complicated interactions between schools and social safety net programs within our federalist system...|$|R
