500|$|Colbert {{appeared}} as a correspondent on The Daily Show between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later {{form the basis for}} his Colbert Report persona, one that its creator calls a [...] "fool who <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of his life playing not the fool". Colbert frequently cites Stone Phillips — whom he describes as having [...] "the greatest neck in journalism" [...] — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as Geraldo Rivera, [...] "because he's got this great sense of mission... He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report". As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, fellow correspondent Steve Carell, or host Jon Stewart in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing. Other Daily Show correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series.

Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E
