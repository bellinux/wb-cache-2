500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E
60|$|And so {{the time}} went on till we reached the kraal where the king's {{business}} must be done, and where <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> should part.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> stood amazed. Then I {{realised}} {{that the}} crest of Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians' Heat-Ray now that the college was cleared out of the way.|$|E
5000|$|Ferdinand {{recorded}} {{the events in}} his diary: [...] "The affair ended with the new Emperor kneeling before his old Emperor and Lord, that is to say, me, and asking for a blessing, which I gave him, laying both hands {{on his head and}} making the sign of the Holy Cross ... then <b>I</b> embraced him <b>and</b> kissed our new master, and then we went to our room. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>wife</b> heard Holy Mass ... After that <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>wife</b> packed our bags." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have not}} had any chance to take {{anything}} away," [...] <b>I</b> said; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> remarked that whether they had stolen anything or not, they had made a dreadful mess on the floor, and had broken the table. They should certainly be punished.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What! <b>And</b> leave <b>my</b> {{people to}} be killed? Macumazahn, you did not use to talk so. Still, hearken. Macumazahn, will {{you do me a}} service? I will pay you well for it. I would get <b>my</b> {{daughter}} Gita <b>and</b> <b>my</b> little grandson Sinala into safety. If <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wives</b> are wiped out it does not matter, for we are old. But her <b>I</b> would save, <b>and</b> the boy <b>I</b> would save, so that one may live who will remember my name. Now if I were to send them across the drift, say at the dawn, not to-morrow and not the next day, but the day after, would you receive them into your wagon and deliver them safe to some place in Natal? I have money hidden, fifty pieces of gold, and you may take half of these and also half of the cattle if ever I live to get them back out of the keeping of the king.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no. Remember, Sir Jasper was my {{commanding}} officer, and <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> owe {{everything to}} him. I could supply the amount, {{so that no}} one would guess from the accounts that anything had been amiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, when <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{were married}} at Norcombe Church," [...] {{said the old}} maltster, not pleased at finding himself {{left out of the}} subject, [...] "we were called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood--everybody said so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{investment}} is bringing in good interest," [...] he said, [...] "and {{as it was}} Jerry who did the work in getting it, the lad shall have it just as it stands when <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard a yellin' {{around the}} ice-houses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I'd dress <b>and</b> {{come over and}} see what it meant. Hope you ain't done no damage," [...] the man continued, {{somewhat}} anxiously.|$|R
60|$|I was {{convinced}} that something {{ought to be done}} to end this unpleasant state of affairs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> Miss Lucille into council on the subject. After we had deliberated a little while an idea came to Ruth.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{may feel}} some surprise, but I {{believe it will}} vanish when they have seen her; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> choose <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> to please myself. I think I have means enough to make my way without any help, though I haven't a great deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"I don't {{know how}} to pray properly, but <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> say--God, make our hearts light. Take away the darkness. We believe that you love us because you sent JESUS to become a Man and die for us, but we can't {{understand}} it all. Make us fit to be baptized." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our Black Lady forbid!" [...] {{said the}} innkeeper, {{with a quick}} voice, and with rather a dismayed look; [...] "said I that thou shouldst not have a bed? St. Florian desert me if <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> would not sooner sleep in the chimney-corner than thou shouldst miss one wink of thy slumbers!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now we were {{come to the}} palace, {{almost the}} only house that was left {{standing}} in the City of Pines. Here an apartment was given to us {{at the end of}} the long building, and presently a command was brought to us that <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> should wait upon the Spanish captain Diaz.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' said he; 'but <b>I</b> have called, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> has {{answered}} that she cannot come out yet, but in half-an-hour {{she hopes to}} come, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am waiting for her.

6000|$|... "You mistake, captain," [...] Monsieur Flambard said. [...] "As you know, the lugger {{was only}} passed {{over to me}} by Monsieur Martin to escape confiscation. There {{is no longer any}} need that I should appear as owner; and in fact Madame Martin, as {{representative}} of her husband, is the owner of the Henriette, and <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> are passengers on board her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I know not, friend Davenant; but I {{know that}} <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and John, have so made up our minds, {{and we are}} of a race not given to change. The land would but be an incumbrance and a trouble to us. John would far rather make his path in life, as he chooses it, than live upon the rents of ill-gotten lands. You will receive your own again, and all parties will be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 24th. Up betimes, {{and with}} my salt eele went down into the parler and there got my boy and did beat him till I was fain to take breath two or three times, yet for all I am afeard it will make the boy never the better, he is grown so {{hardened}} in his tricks, which I am sorry for, he being capable of making a brave man, and is a boy that <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> love very well.|$|E
50|$|He {{returned}} to the country, {{and was in the}} daily habit of paying a visit to Hales, then reduced to a ‘mean lodging’ at Eton, where in May he died. On learning his friend's circumstances, Farindon said: ‘I have at present money to command, and to-morrow will pay you fifty pounds in part of the many sums <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>wife</b> have received of you in our great necessities, and will pay you more, suddenly, as you shall want it.’ Hales, though nearly at his last shilling of ready money, refused to take a penny from Farindon. It was to Farindon that Hales gave directions for his simple funeral.|$|R
60|$|All {{three of}} the children, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> myself, are going through the hooping-cough. The east-wind of this season and region is most horrible. There have been no really warm days; for though the {{sunshine}} is sometimes hot, there is never any diffused heat throughout the air. On passing from the sunshine into the shade, we immediately feel too cool.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. But <b>I</b> took it, <b>and</b> went home, and for {{two days}} I {{did not look at}} it. And then there came an illness upon me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know not what passed. But two men who had been hard on me came to the house when <b>I</b> was out, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was in a terrible state; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> gave her the money, and she went into Silverbridge and paid them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I will,' said he, 'but {{there is}} nothing to tell about it. <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> have lived all our days on a moor in North Jutland, until this last year, when she took a fancy to go to Rome. We set out with our two sons but turned back long before we got there, and are now on our way home again. That's all my own story, and our two sons have lived with us all their days, so {{there is nothing}} more to be told about them either.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} come in yesterday, Mark," [...] he said. [...] "I knew {{that you would be}} best alone; and, indeed, I was myself so terribly upset by the news that I did not feel equal to it. I need not say how deeply <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> sympathize with you. Never did a kinder heart beat than your father's; never have I seen people so universally grieved as they are in the village. I doubt whether a man went to work yesterday, and as for the women, had it been a father they had lost they could not be more affected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] Jabez said, [...] "for {{forty-five years}} I {{have been a}} good son to you; but it is time that I took my stand. It {{seems to me that the}} {{principles}} upon which the soldiers of Cromwell fought, were the principles which animated the Israelites of old. Exodus, Judges, and Kings were the groundwork of their religion, not the Gospels. It has gradually been borne upon me that such is not the religion of the New Testament, and, while I seek in no way to dispute your right to think as you choose, I say the time has come when <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will act upon our principles." ...|$|E
6000|$|By the {{following}} autumn Glendenning {{had completed the}} seventh year of his engagement to Miss Bentley, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reminded <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that this {{seemed to be the}} scriptural length of a betrothal, as typified in the service which Jacob rendered for Rachel. [...] "But he had a prospective father-in-law to deal with," [...] I added, [...] "and Glendenning a mother-in-law. That may make a difference." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This was {{not long}} before you came," [...] Featherstone continued. [...] "It was a {{wonderful}} relief to know the danger was over, and then you told us how Lawrence had grown out of his folly and become a useful man. Although we longed to see him, our satisfaction was complete. Now this letter comes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fear <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> is unable to bear the strain again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, [...] "but <b>I</b> have called; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> has {{answered}} that she cannot come out yet, but {{in half an}} hour she hopes to come, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am waiting for her. Poor woman!" [...] says he, [...] "she is brought sadly down; she has had a swelling, and it is broke, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope she will recover, but I fear the child will die. But it is the Lord!"--Here he stopped, and wept very much.|$|R
60|$|But {{why should}} I gird at you or anybody, when {{the truth is}} we are the most miserable sinners in the world? For we are not coming home, I dare not. Even coming to Sydney has made me quite ill, and back I go to Samoa, whither please address--Apia, Samoa--(and {{remember}} it is Sámó-a, a spondee to begin with, or Sahmoa, if you prefer that writing)--back <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> go to Samoa to live on our landed estate with four black labour boys {{in a kind of}} a sort of house, which Lloyd will describe to you. For he has gone to England: receive him like a favour and a piece of cake; he is our greeting to friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, father, I have honoured you, and I shall honour {{you to the}} end; but a man has {{no right}} to give up his {{conscience}} to his father; for it is written, also, that a man shall leave father and mother, and wife and home to follow the Lord. I have heard you, father, and the elders of our church, quote abundant texts from Scripture, but never one, that I can recall, from the New Testament. Hitherto, I have been as an Israelite of Joshua's time. Henceforward, I hope to be a Christian. I grieve to anger you, father, and for years I have held my peace rather than do so; but the time has come when the spirit within me will no longer permit me to hold my peace. In all worldly matters, I am still your obedient son, ready to labour to my utmost to gather up wealth which I do not enjoy, to live a life as hard as that of the poorest tenant on our lands; but, as touching higher matters, <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> go our own way." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{fortnight}} later Emma and I came to Dunchester {{and took}} up our abode in a quaint red-brick house of the Queen Anne period, which we hired for a not extravagant rent of 80 pounds a year. Although the position of this house was not fashionable, nothing {{could have been more}} suitable from a doctor's point of view, as it stood in a little street near the market-place and absolutely in the centre of the city. Moreover, it had two beautiful reception chambers on the ground floor, oak-panelled, and with carved Adam's mantelpieces, which made excellent waiting-rooms for patients. Some time passed, however, and our thousand pounds, in which the expense of furnishing had made a considerable hole, was melting rapidly before those rooms were put to a practical use. Both <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> did all that we could to get practice. We called upon people who had been friends of my father and grandfather; we attended missionary and other meetings of a non-political character; regardless of expense we {{went so far as to}} ask old ladies to tea.|$|E
6000|$|After {{they had}} gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady- love. [...] "She has no conversation," [...] he said, [...] "and I am afraid {{that she is a}} coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind." [...] And certainly, {{whenever}} the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. [...] "I admit that she is domestic," [...] he continued, [...] "but <b>I</b> love travelling, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> consequently, should love travelling also." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{returning}} to Pine Ridge in 1905, Standing Bear {{was chosen as}} a chief of the Oglala Lakota on July 4, 1905. There was a great celebration. “In different places they started to sing songs of praise for me. Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things I had brought along. I kept this up until I had given away everything <b>I</b> owned, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walked away with practically nothing. We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking to Billboard back in May 2016, drummer Adrian Young said of Dreamcar, [...] "It doesn’t {{sound like}} anything, it {{actually}} doesn’t sound like AFI or No Doubt. And sometimes I'm not objective enough {{to really understand}} it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> ask <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> or friends, I play them a snippet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> go, 'Does this sound like either one of these bands?' And they’re like, 'No.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think that's a good thing." ...|$|R
