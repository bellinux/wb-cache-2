5000|$|A {{grandfather}} clause (or grandfather policy) is {{a provision in}} which an old rule continues to apply to some existing situations while a new rule will apply to all future cases. Those exempt from the new rule {{are said to have}} <b>grandfather</b> <b>rights</b> or acquired rights, or to have been grandfathered in. Frequently, the exemption is limited; it may extend for a set time, or it may be lost under certain circumstances. For example, a [...] "grandfathered power plant" [...] might be exempt from new, more restrictive pollution laws, but the exception may be revoked and the new rules would apply if the plant were expanded. Often, such a provision is used as a compromise or out of practicality, to allow new rules to be enacted without upsetting a well-established logistical or political situation. This extends the idea of a rule not being retroactively applied. Another common example of a gradfather clause is a customer of a ultility or telecommunications service who pays a certain rate and maintains that rate even if other subscribers and new subscribers face higher or increasing rates. If it is an unlimited clause it continues indefinitely and is only cancelled if the subscriber discontinues the services, fails to pay their bill(s) or makes certain changes to their contract.|$|E

In 1732 she went to present her case to the Board of Trade in London. Despite the doubts of Griffiths, the Board of Trade ruled in her favour and they decreed that she should be paid £2,000 in exchange for her rights to the lands. William Popple of the Board of Trade noted that she was not well and paid her in 1734 to avoid having to negotiate with her children following her death.|$|R

40|$|The new {{generation}} ATM system defined in SESAR gives air navigation service provider (regulator) {{the possibility of}} providing a delay reduction service to reduce delays.
