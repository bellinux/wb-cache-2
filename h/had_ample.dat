5|$|By {{contrast}} the Russian forces' morale was extremely high. The Russian commanders <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> experience in siege operations; Paskevich himself had captured {{at least six}} fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas-Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.|$|E
5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip {{that the jury}} had <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> opportunity to form its own opinion of him.

5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell’'s successor, Oliver Bulleid, {{oversaw the}} {{building}} of twenty {{members of the class}} at Eastleigh railway works between January 1938 and September 1939. Bulleid is reported to have found the Q Class uninspiring, having been manufactured to traditional Victorian principles of locomotive design, and is said to have stated that the order for the Q Class would have been cancelled if he had been appointed CME earlier. However, Bulleid <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> opportunity either to cancel the order or to build and test a single prototype, without incurring the expense of building twenty members of the class, if this was the case.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{the above}} details are {{accurate}} or not, {{it is clear}} that Svein, Olaf the Swede and Eirik <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had taken control of Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on friendly terms with Olaf the Swede and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been driven from his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E
5|$|The Hamar-based {{newspaper}} Demokraten ("The Democrat") {{was started}} on 15 September 1909. The initiator and first editor was Olav Kringen, who <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> experience as {{the editor of}} Social-Demokraten from 1903 until 1906. Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the Mjøsa Cities and Hedemarken, but in its first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen, two northern regions. The name Østoplandenes Socialistiske Partiblad was considered for the newspaper, but the historical name Demokraten prevailed. The name was suggested by local Labour MP Karl Amundsen. Demokratens coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended, and in southern Østerdalen a new labour newspaper, Østerdalens Arbeiderblad, {{was set up in}} 1915. In northern Østerdalen, Arbeidets Rett was popular among the labour movement. According to reports in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen, namely the city Lillehammer, in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Total British {{losses were}} four killed and 54 wounded. Captured in Table Bay were the Dutch East Indiaman Castor and the 14-gun naval brig Star, which was renamed HMS Hope. Elphinstone's {{substantial}} squadron remained on {{station at the}} Cape to deter efforts to recapture the colony. Parts of this force were subsequently deployed to bolster British forces in the Indian Ocean. The blockade of Île de France was restored and Arrogant and Victorious {{were sent to the}} Dutch East Indies where they would fight an inconclusive battle with a French squadron off Sumatra in September 1796. Elphinstone himself sailed for Madras, where he received reports that a Dutch force had sailed from the Netherlands to retake the Cape Colony. The Admiral returned to Cape Town, assembling a large squadron to await the Dutch arrival. Further reports revealed the strength and progress of the Dutch and Elphinstone <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> time to prepare his squadron for their arrival and increase the garrison ashore. The Dutch rear-admiral, Engelbertus Lucas, spent almost six months on the passage and gathered no intelligence on British defences. Thus when he arrived off the Cape he was soon discovered by Elphinstone in Saldanha Bay and intimidated into surrendering without a fight.|$|E
5|$|Two {{resistance}} movements emerged {{following the}} invasion: the communist-led, multi-ethnic Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted {{almost entirely of}} Serbs. The Partisans were led by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, while the Chetniks were led by Colonel Draža Mihailović, {{an officer in the}} interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely diverging goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war status quo, whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored. Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union, targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities. By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans. The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> military experience, having fought in the Spanish Civil War. By late summer, they had 8,000fighters spread across 21detachments in Serbia alone. Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World WarI or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. They boasted around 20,000fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia {{at the time of the}} massacre.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and <b>had</b> <b>ample</b> time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E
