5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; <b>dehiscence</b> (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the {{pressure}} exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. <b>Dehiscence</b> is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. <b>Dehiscence</b> is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (<b>dehiscence)</b> of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
25|$|Wound <b>dehiscence,</b> the {{bursting}} of {{a surgical}} wound {{at the line}} of closure sutures, is a medical complication resulting from the poor healing of the wound. Unless wound <b>dehiscence</b> aesthetically compromises the breast-lift outcome, it is managed conservatively.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} suture tension in primary wound closure of mucoperiosteal flaps. Materials and methods: Sixty patients, scheduled for a single implant installation, were recruited. Before suturing, the wound closing forces were measured with an electronic tension device. One week after the surgery, the wounds were inspected with regard to complete closure. Results: The applied tension varied between 0. 01 and 0. 4 N. In 72 % a tension of 0. 01 - 0. 1 N was applied, resulting in few <b>dehiscences</b> (10 %). Higher closing forces (> 0. 1 N) increased the percentage of wound <b>dehiscences</b> significantly (≥ 40 %). Conclusions: It appears necessary to control flap tension {{at the time of}} wound closure to achieve a primary closure. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Sesame {{seeds are}} {{protected}} by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. This is called <b>dehiscence.</b> The <b>dehiscence</b> time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The discovery of an indehiscent mutant (analogous to nonshattering domestic grains) by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high-yielding, dehiscence-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to <b>dehiscence</b> continue to limit domestic US production.|$|E
25|$|Among termite {{species in}} the Apicotermitinae that are soldierless or where {{soldiers}} are rare, mouth secretions are commonly replaced by abdominal <b>dehiscence.</b> These termites contract their abdominal muscles, resulting in the fracturing of the abdominal wall and the expulsion of gut contents. Because abdominal <b>dehiscence</b> is quite effective at killing ants, the noxious chemical substance released is likely contained within the termite itself.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the periodontally available bone in the mandibula and maxilla before and after an orthodontic treatment with the Invisalign® aligner system using the three-dimensional images of digital volume tomography (DVT). Methodology: The periodontally available bone was measured in 864 teeth using the images of 36 digital volume tomographies taken from 18 patients. The orthodontically treated patients were divided into different study groups according to sex (male / female), orthodontical indication (crowding / spacing / sagittal anomalies) and age (under 21 / aged between 21 and 40 years / aged over 41). The periodontally available bone was then analyzed with the InVivoDental software InVivo 5. 1. 0 (developed by Anatomage Inc., San Jose, California) and, afterwards, the results were statistically assessed (using the software of the SPSS Inc., an IBM Company from Chicago, IL). Results: The reliability coefficient according to Houston (Mean: R = 0. 98) showed that the digital volume tomography is suited for the measurement of the periodontally available bone. Over the entire period of therapy, the oral <b>dehiscences</b> increased significantly from 2. 38 millimeters to 2. 42 millimeters (p = 0. 001 respectively p = 0. 010). The vestibulary <b>dehiscences</b> and the bone width, on the contrary, exhibited no significant changes (p ≥ 0. 05). In case of the female patients, we could diagnose bone loss at eight of 240 measuring points and in case of the male patients, bone loss could be diagnosed at three of the 240 observed measuring points. In both groups, bone loss especially occurred in the incisors and the first molars. The age-related analysis revealed a significant reduction of the available bone at 15 of the 240 measuring points among the youngest patients and at nine of 240 measuring points among the oldest patients. In the group of the middle-aged patients, we could also observe an intermediate extent of changes in periodontally bone. Besides, there was no significant correlation between the specific location of the treated teeth and the occurrence of <b>dehiscences.</b> In the middle and apical third of the root, significant labial and buccal bone width decrease could be observed in the mandible (p = 0. 010 respectively p = 0. 016), whereas in the maxilla we could observe significant oral bone width decrease (p = 0. 003 respectively p = 0. 005). The maxillary and mandibular lateral teeth as well as the maxillary central incisors were most frequently affected by significant changes in bone structure. Angulation changes of more than 2. 5 degrees led to a significant aggravation of the <b>dehiscences</b> but only in case of two teeth (r = 0. 027 respectively r = 0. 006). Conclusion: Under the condition of specific setting parameters, the digital volume tomography (DVT) is suited to measure bone width and <b>dehiscences</b> in an individual and reproducible way. Yet, clear statistical correlations could only be observed with respect to oral <b>dehiscences.</b> All the other results were either statistically not significant or they did not allow for unambiguous conclusions. The presented tendencies should therefore be substantiated by further follow-ups...|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the spread}} of {{infection}} through the described <b>dehiscences</b> and canals {{there are two other}} mechanisms of spread that {{play an important role in}} the complications of bacterial rhinosinusitis. Firstly, there can be a bacterial thrombophlebitis through valveless veins causing spread of infection to the cavernous sinus [8, 12]. Secondly, there can be direct extension of infection through osteomyelitis [12].|$|R
25|$|The fruit (utricle) is {{immersed}} in the swollen, hardened perianth base. The fruit is indehiscent or <b>dehiscence</b> eventually circumscissile. The horizontal seed is orbicular or reniform, with dark brown, smooth or glossy seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of ileus and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage intestinal motility. The incision site is carefully monitored for <b>dehiscence,</b> or complete failure of the incision leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of the incision site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until the incision has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of <b>dehiscence.</b> Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and <b>dehiscence</b> may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of antimicrobial resistance. The incision usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and anastomosis is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After the incision has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>dehiscence</b> {{can be detected}} by a high definition (0.6mm or less) coronal CT scan of the temporal bone, currently the most reliable way to distinguish between superior canal <b>dehiscence</b> syndrome (SCDS) and other conditions of the inner ear involving similar symptoms such as Ménière's disease and perilymphatic fistula. Other diagnostic tools include the vestibular evoked myogenic potential or VEMP test, videonystagmography (VNG), electrocochleography (ECOG) and the rotational chair test. An accurate diagnosis is of great significance as unnecessary exploratory middle ear surgery may thus be avoided. Several of the symptoms typical to SCDS (e.g. vertigo and Tullio) may also be present singly {{or as part of}} Ménière's disease, sometimes causing the one illness {{to be confused with the}} other. There are reported cases of patients being affected by both Ménière's disease and SCDS concurrently.|$|E
30|$|Results: In total, 32 {{studies were}} included. Compared to LH, AH was {{associated}} with more wound <b>dehiscences</b> (RR 2.55, 95 %-CI 1.69 - 3.84, p=. 000), more wound infections (RR 4.27, 95 %-CI 2.72 - 6.70, p=. 000), and longer hospital admission (MD 2.7 days, 95 %-CI 1.8 - 3.7, p=. 000).

30|$|Besides {{the use of}} membranes, the {{application}} of a sufficient incision technique is crucial to avoid <b>dehiscences.</b> In our study, augmentations performed with a modified poncho incision had lower exposure rates than augmentations performed with a mid-crestal incision. All the <b>dehiscences</b> appeared {{in the area of the}} suture. Therefore, positioning the margin of the wound in the vestibulum and in distance to the mesh seems to reduce the risk for an exposure of the TM as the margin of a wound represents the most important nutritional structure for survival and the basis for reliable wound healing [33, 34]. In addition, exposure rate in the maxilla was significantly higher than in the mandible. This could be explained with the higher augmentations in the maxilla in our study. In our study, both craniofacial and iliac crest bones were used for augmentation procedures. This may influence later bone resorption and long-term stability. However, a recent influence of the used material on augmentation success was not seen.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesMechanical {{stapling}} {{devices have}} been established as the mainstay of therapy in the selective isolation and division of bronchial and vascular structures during anatomic lung resection. Few data are available regarding the application of energy-based tissue fusion technology during anatomic lung resection. In the present study, we evaluated the use of energy-based instruments for {{the division of the}} pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. MethodsAnatomic lung resection (segmentectomy or lobectomy) was performed using energy-based coagulative fusion technology. A low-profile jaw can be used to facilitate dissection in both open and video-assisted thoracic surgery cases, applying a seal 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. Two energy applications were applied to the arterial and venous branches before vessel division. ResultsThe bipolar tissue fusion system was used in 211 patients between 2008 and 2010 (104 lobectomies and 107 anatomic segmentectomies). Initially, we used a device with a smaller, curved jaw (n =  12), producing a 3. 3 - to 4. 7 -cm seal. No arterial <b>dehiscences</b> and 2 partial venous <b>dehiscences</b> that were recognized and controlled intraoperatively occurred. For the remaining cases, we used a new device with a larger jaw that applied a seal 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. No arterial or venous <b>dehiscences</b> (vessel size range, 0. 4 - 1. 2 cm) occurred. ConclusionsThe bipolar tissue fusion system provided safe and reliable control of pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. The use of energy-based tissue fusion technology represents a reasonable alternative to mechanical stapling devices during anatomic lung resection...|$|R

25|$|The {{post-operative}} complications {{occurred in}}cluded seroma, wound <b>dehiscence,</b> hematoma; whereas partial NAC necrosis occurred in 10 per {{cent of the}} reduced breasts; yet, after refinement of the Lejour technique, the study Vertical Mammaplasty: Early Complications After 250 Personal Consecutive Cases (1999), reported a reduced incidence rate of 7.0 per cent in the 324 breast reductions performed in 167 patients. Moreover, the incidence of such post-operative complications is greater among the women whose breasts required large-volume resection of the parenchyma; in women who were obese; in women who were tobacco smokers; and in young women. Furthermore, wound <b>dehiscence,</b> epidermolysis, adipose tissue necrosis, and infection occur less among women who undergo Lejour-technique breast reduction, than among women who undergo a periareolar, Anchor pattern breast-reduction, or an inferior-pedicle breast reduction. Nonetheless, bottom-edge asymmetry occurs more among Lejour-technique patients; the revision surgery rates can be up to 10 per cent. Moreover, the liposuctioning of the breast does not increase the rate of local medical complications; decreased NAC sensitivity occurs in 10 per cent of the women; and total NAC insensitivity occurs in 1.0 per cent of women.|$|E
25|$|Once diagnosed, {{the gap in}} the {{temporal}} bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected bone or plugging of the superior semicircular canal.

Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{comparison}} of dental morphology and restorative work for human identification {{has been well}} documented. This case study involved documentation of osseointegrated and clinically restored dental implants following cremation. METHODS: The mandible and the maxilla were excised from a head containing implants and cremated. The remains were retrieved, digital and radiographic images were taken and elemental analysis undertaken. The brand of implants was identified utilizing web based search engines. A prosthodontist, known to commonly use this implant system, was approached to ascertain possibilities that matched the data given. RESULTS: Following cremation the implants were identified and a prosthodontist was {{able to identify the}} deceased. Two implants in the maxilla had <b>dehiscences</b> on their buccal surfaces, which could not be detected by periapical radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: Dental implants osseointegrated and restored with a prosthetic superstructure were recognizable following severe incineration. It was possible to trace back the identity of the unknown victim to a prosthodontist. Bone <b>dehiscences</b> discovered in this study highlighted how two-dimensional radiographs may not reveal lack of bone support. JW Berketa, H James, NEI Langlois and LC Richard...|$|R

Some complications include autonomic dysreflexia, bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthroses, sepsis, amyloidosis, anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer - secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds). Sores may recur if those with pressure ulcers do not follow recommended treatment or may instead develop seromas, hematomas, infections, or wound <b>dehiscence.</b> Paralyzed individuals {{are the most likely}} to have pressure sores recur. In some cases, complications from pressure sores can be life-threatening. The most common causes of fatality stem from kidney failure and amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|Sesame {{fruit is}} a capsule, {{normally}} pubescent, rectangular in section, and typically grooved with a short, triangular beak. The {{length of the}} fruit capsule varies from 2 to 8cm, its width varies between 0.5 and 2cm, {{and the number of}} loculi varies from four to 12. The fruit naturally splits open (dehisces) to release the seeds by splitting along the septa from top to bottom or by means of two apical pores, depending on the varietal cultivar. The degree of <b>dehiscence</b> is of importance in breeding for mechanised harvesting, as is the insertion height of the first capsule.|$|E
25|$|Surgery poses {{significant}} {{expense and}} risks, including peritonitis, {{the formation of}} adhesions, complications secondary to general anesthesia, injury upon recovery of the horse which may require euthanasia, <b>dehiscence,</b> or infection of the incisional site. Additionally, surgical cases may develop post-operative ileus which requires further medical management. However, surgery {{may be required to}} save the life of the horse, and 1–2% of all colics require surgical intervention. If a section of intestine is significantly damaged, it may need to be removed (resection) and the healthy parts reattached together (anastomosis). Horses may have up to 80% of their intestines removed and still function normally, without needing a special diet.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Bone <b>dehiscences</b> and gingival {{recession}} {{have been}} associated with orthodontic arch expansion. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess and compare periodontal modelling during application of two force levels. METHODS The second and third upper molars were orthodontically moved buccally with conventional or low forces for 60 or 90 days in 32 rats. Ten non-treated animals were used as controls. The influence of force level and time on dental, skeletal and periodontal parameters (i. e. height and thickness of gingiva and bone) was assessed on histomicrographs using a mixed linear model. RESULTS Facial tooth position (725 μm, CI 379 - 1072 μm, distal root of the third molar) and maxillary skeletal width (295 μm, CI 168 - 421 μm) differed significantly between force groups. Despite bone apposition at the facial aspects of the moved roots, bone <b>dehiscences</b> were developing and bone thickness was decreasing during facial tooth movement. Development of gingival recession was scarce and in cases with extreme facial tooth movement. No remarkable differences between force levels were found for any of the periodontal parameters. CONCLUSIONS Facial tooth movement with conventional or low forces resulted in similar modelling of facial alveolar bone and gingiva...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} accuracy and reliability of cone-beam computed tomography for the imaging of thin vestibular periodontal structures. Materials and methods: Five human skulls were scanned by CBCT (GALILEOS comfort, Sirona Dental GmbH, Bensheim, Deutschland) at 85 kV and 35 / 42 mAs. Linear measurements were performed on each tooth (0, 3 mm voxel size), evaluating periodontal bone height, bony <b>dehiscences</b> and fenestrations. Results were compared to data measured by caliper on the skulls. After preparation of several lamellas of undetectable bone their thickness was examined by stereomicroscopy. In addition, influence of voxel size, exposure time, type of defect, tooth area, detection of the cemento-enamel-junction and variations of contrast / lightness on measuring accuracy were evaluated. Results: Evaluations by CBCT showed a significant underestimation of buccal bone height (0, 13 mm for 35 mAs, p= 0, 000; 0, 11 mm for 42 mAs, p= 0, 005). Mean deviations to reference were 0, 26 mm and 0, 28 mm, respectively. There was neither a significant influence of perceptibility of the cemento-enamel-junction, nor of the variation of contrast and brightness. Moreover, the two different exposure times showed no statistical difference, however, a tendency for more accurate measuring at 42 mAs was evident. Measuring anterior teeth (especially in the mandible) and <b>dehiscences</b> the real bone level tended to be underestimated, single measuring points showed great deviations. There was a good reliability of detection <b>dehiscences</b> (sensitivity 97 / 94 %, specifity 98 %), in contrast to fenestrations which were mostly overestimated and often (especially maxilla) detected false-positive (sensitivity 100 %, specifity 86 %). For a resolution of 0, 3 mm voxel size areas with a bone thickness less than 0, 39 mm could not be detected properly. The measurements showed significantly better results for 0, 15 mm than 0, 3 mm voxel size. Finally, comparing the results to the radiographic images, a subjectively diffuse depicted root surface could be a hint of false-positive detection of <b>dehiscences</b> or fenestrations in this area. Conclusion: Cone-beam computed tomography provides a good imaging of periodontal structures in three planes, true to scale and without overlap. For specific clinical consideration it seems to provide sufficiently precise radiological diagnostics of the osseous morphology at 0, 3 mm voxel size for most discrepancies could be classified as negligibly small. There are limitations if the bony thickness ranges near to the spatial resolution of the CBCT leading to false-positive diagnosis of bone defects. Therefore use of high resolution CBCT is advisable for periodontal issues...|$|R
30|$|Similar to {{the fact}} that peri-implant lesions are quite {{different}} from periodontitis is the reaction behavior of the alveolar bone adjacent to the teeth completely different from its behavior at the implant sites. Although, it can be accepted that fenestrations and <b>dehiscences</b> occur at implants in the form of severe peri-implant inflammatory defects when the implants are set at or even outside the bone base. In this case, hardly reconstructable peri-implant defect morphology will result due to the 3 D missed bone.|$|R
