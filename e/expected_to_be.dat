5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{intersection}} of the ‘‘Overworked American’’ and the ‘‘Sandwiched Generation. ’’ Recent studies indicate that many U. S. workers would prefer to work shorter hours. For workers who are sandwiched between childcare and eldercare or who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the future, questions remain about work hour preferences. We use a representative sample and distinguish between currently sandwiched workers and those who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in five years. The proportion of workers who are currently sandwiched has increased from 1992 to 2002. Further, workers who <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sandwiched <b>are</b> less likely <b>to</b> want to reduce their workweek hours than others...|$|R

5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides {{which tend to}} be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
