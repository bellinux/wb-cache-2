5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5Â°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E

5000|$|Accepting {{the tough}} IAEA inspections, it {{revealed}} that Iran {{had established a}} large enrichment facility using centrifuge based on the Urenco, which had been obtained [...] "from a foreign intermediary in 1989".

25|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> process uses a {{large number}} of {{rotating}} cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas molecules containing 238U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. <b>Gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E
25|$|Enrichment {{involves}} {{increasing the}} percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of gaseous diffusion or <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> The enriched result is then converted into uranium dioxide powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called fuel rods. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.|$|E
25|$|The Zippe {{centrifuge}} is {{an improvement}} {{on the standard}} <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> the primary difference being the use of heat. The bottom of the rotating cylinder is heated, producing convection currents that move the 235U up the cylinder, {{where it can be}} collected by scoops. This improved centrifuge design is used commercially by Urenco to produce nuclear fuel and was used by Pakistan in their nuclear weapons program.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{developed}} the heavy water moderated {{design in the}} post-World War II era to explore nuclear energy while lacking access to enrichment facilities. War-era enrichment systems were extremely expensive to build and operate, whereas the heavy water solution allowed the use of natural uranium in the experimental ZEEP reactor. A much less expensive enrichment system was developed, but the United States classified work on the cheaper <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> process. The CANDU was therefore designed to use natural uranium.|$|E
25|$|Qadeer Khan {{had brought}} with him {{knowledge}} of <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> technologies that he had learned through his position at the classified URENCO uranium enrichment plant in the Netherlands. After General Akbar, Khan himself {{was put in charge}} of building, equipping and operating the Kahuta facility. Khan took over the centrifuge part of the Uranium Enrichment Program from Chairman of PAEC Munir Ahmad Khan, while all other uranium related steps to making uranium gas for enrichment remained under Munir Ahmad Khan's responsibility. Bhutto also continued to retain Chairman of PAEC Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan as the head of Plutonium production, nuclear fuel cycle, uranium exploration, processing and conversion, nuclear weapons development and reactor programs.|$|E
500|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> process, where gaseous {{uranium hexafluoride}} (...) is {{separated}} by {{the difference in}} molecular weight between 235UF6 and 238UF6 using high-speed centrifuges, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and {{was used in the}} Manhattan Project. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E

500|$|On 1 July, Marshall and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, {{surveyed}} {{sites in}} the Knoxville area {{with representatives of the}} TVA and Stone & Webster, the designated construction contractor. No perfectly suitable site was found, and Marshall even ordered another survey of the Spokane, Washington area. At the time, the proposed nuclear reactor, <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> and gaseous diffusion technologies were still in the research stage, and the design of the plant was a long way off. The schedules, which called for construction work on the nuclear reactor to commence by 1 October 1942, the electromagnetic plant by 1 November, the centrifugal plant by 1 January 1943 and the gaseous diffusion plant by 1 March, were unrealistic. While work could not commence on the plants, a start could be made on the housing and administrative buildings. Stone & Webster therefore drew up a detailed report on the most promising site, about [...] west of Knoxville. Stephane Groueff later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|K-25 {{became a}} {{prototype}} for additional gaseous diffusion facilities {{established in the}} early post-war years. The first of these was the [...] K-27 completed in September 1945. It {{was followed by the}} [...] K-29 in 1951, the [...] K-31 in 1951 and the [...] K-33 in 1954. Additional gaseous diffusion facilities were built at Paducah, Kentucky in 1952, and Portsmouth, Ohio in 1954. The K-25 plant was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Today, uranium isotope separation is usually done by the more energy-efficient ultra centrifuge process, developed in the Soviet Union. Centrifuge cascades began operating at Oak Ridge in 1961. A <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge</b> test facility (K-1210) opened in 1975, followed by a larger centrifuge plant demonstration facility (K-1220) in 1982. In response to an order from President Lyndon B. Johnson to cut production of enriched uranium by 25 percent, K-25 and K-27 ceased production in 1964, but in 1969 K-25 began producing uranium enriched to 3 to 5 percent for use in nuclear reactors. Martin Marietta Energy replaced Union Carbide as the operator in 1984. Gaseous diffusion finally ceased on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Production of enriched uranium ceased in Portsmouth in 2001, and at Paducah in 2013.|$|E

R first confirmed Pakistan's nuclear programs by analysing the hair samples snatched from the floor of barber shops near KRL; which showed that Pakistan had developed the ability to enrich uranium to weapons-grade quality. RAW agents knew of Kahuta Research Laboratories from at least early 1978, when the then Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai, accidentally thwarted R's operations on Pakistan's covert nuclear weapons program.

2500|$|Aerodynamic {{enrichment}} processes include the Becker jet nozzle techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the LIGA {{process and the}} vortex tube separation process. These aerodynamic separation processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the <b>gas</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a carrier gas achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant. [...] A demonstration plant was built in Brazil by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the separation nozzle process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.|$|E
