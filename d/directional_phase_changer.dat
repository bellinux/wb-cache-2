Our study reveals that the rods assemble via two continuous <b>directional</b> <b>phase</b> separations unlike a conventional two-dimensional phase separation. As the rod curvature increases, in the membrane tube the rods assemble along the azimuthal direction and subsequently along the longitudinal direction accompanied by shape transformation of the tube.

40|$|Most public {{utilities}} depend {{on electric power}} to function, so it is paramount that a constant power source is available. These {{public utilities}} get their supply from the public mains {{and in the case}} where the public mains fails a back-up power source is necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the public utilities. Switching the public utilities from the mains to the back-up power creates a period of time when the utilities will be without power and the longer the time delay the lesser the efficiency of the public utilities. The stress of manual switching also makes the utilities inefficient. Examples of these public utilities are street lights, traffic lights, water pumps and traffic sign indicators. A device that completely eliminates the stress of manually switching public utilities from the mains supply to the back-up supply is the Automatic Mains and <b>Phase</b> <b>Changer</b> (AMPC).

40|$|Metaphor has {{a double}} life. It can be {{described}} as a directional process in which a stable, familiar base domain provides inferential structure to a less clearly specified target. But metaphor is also described as a process of finding commonalities, an inherently symmetric process. In this second view, both concepts may be altered by the metaphorical comparison. Whereas most theories of metaphor capture one of these aspects, we offer a model based on structure-mapping that captures both sides of metaphor processing. This predicts (a) an initial processing stage of symmetric alignment; and (b) a later <b>directional</b> <b>phase</b> in which inferences are projected to the target. To test these claims, we collected comprehensibility judgments for forward (e. g., ‘‘A rumor is a virus’’) and reversed (‘‘A virus is a rumor’’) metaphors at early and late stages of processing, using a deadline procedure.

ResultsWe show here that head direction cells in MEC are organized topographically. Head direction tuning varies widely across the entire dorsoventral MEC axis, but in layer III there is a gradual dorsal-to-ventral increase in the average width of the directional firing field. Sharply tuned cells were encountered only at the dorsal end of MEC. Similar topography was not observed among head direction cells in layers V–VI. At all MEC locations, in all layers, the preferred firing direction (<b>directional</b> <b>phase)</b> showed a uniform distribution. The continuity of the dorsoventral tuning gradient coexisted with discrete topography in the spatial scale of simultaneously recorded grid cells.

2500|$|Fire {{behavior}} {{is different in}} every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to {{those that have been}} untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of ecological succession in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and <b>directional</b> <b>phases</b> of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire. [...] Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing herbaceous plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants. Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{report on}} the {{pressure}} dependence of time-resolved femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs-CARS). Fs-CARS {{has been found to}} provide a powerful tool for the investigation of collision-induced line broadening and mixing effects appearing in coherent scattering processes. From these results a new model for describing collision induced intra molecular energy transfer based on only two free fit parameters has been formulated and found to be in excellent agreement with the experiment. A variety of spectroscopic approaches has been used to study collision dynamics in gases. These methods might be classified into incoherent and coherent scattering processes. The scattering amplitude of the latter process depends on the squared number of molecules in the interaction region and the radiation is <b>directional</b> (<b>phase</b> matched). In four wave mixing processes, such as CARS, where pairs of molecules contribute coherently, the scattering rate is related to the product of the third order nonlinear susceptibility (χa(3)) *(χb(3)) of distinct molecules (a,b). For homogeneous gases the time dependent molecular response becomes proportional to |χ(3) | 2.

Such an apparatus expands the exploratory potential of the researcher wherever experimental distinction of factors may necessitate independent control of torque fields around multiple limbs, or the shaping of torque fields of a given joint independently of its plane of motion, or its <b>directional</b> <b>phase</b> within that plane. The apparatus utilizes torque motors. The challenge with torque motors is that they impose added inertia on limbs and thus attenuate joint dynamics. We eliminated this attenuation by establishing an accurate mathematical model of the robotic device using the Box-Jenkins method, and cancelling out its dynamics by employing the inverse of the model as a compensating controller.

Thus, the circulatory system can be visualized by injecting high molecular weight fluorescein labeled dextran into the heart or the large vessels {{at the ends of}} the heart without surgery to remove the body wall. In addition, after staining with neutral red, the movement of blood cells can be easily followed to further characterize the circulatory system. The heart is two gently curved concentric tubes extending across the width of the animal. The inner myocardial tube has a partial constriction approximately in the middle. As in other tunicates, the heart is peristaltic and periodically reverses direction. During the branchial phase blood leaves the anterior end of the heart by two asymmetric vessels that connect to {{the two sides of the}} branchial basket. Blood then flows in both transverse directions through a complex system of ducts in the basket into large ventral and dorsal vessels which carry blood back to the visceral organs in the posterior of the animal. During the visceral phase blood leaves the posterior end of the heart in two vessels that repeatedly bifurcate and fan into the stomach and gonads. Blood velocity, determined by following individual cells in video frames, is high and pulsatory near the heart. A double peak in velocity at the maximum may be due to the constriction in the middle of the heart tube. Blood velocity progressively decreases with distance from the heart. In peripheral regions with vessels of small diameter blood cells frequently collide with vessel walls and cell motion is erratic. The estimated volume of blood flow during each <b>directional</b> <b>phase</b> is greater than the total volume of the animal.
