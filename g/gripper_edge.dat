50|$|Tack strip (US) (also {{known as}} gripper rod (UK), carpet gripper, Smoothedge (Can), tackless strip, and <b>gripper</b> <b>edge)</b> {{is a thin}} piece of wood, between 1 to 2 m long and about 3 cm wide, studded with {{hundreds}} of sharp nails or tacks used in the installation of carpet. They are nailed, tack side up, to {{the perimeter of the}} area being carpeted. After the underlay is installed, the carpet is cut to fit, stretched over the area and firmly anchored to the edges of floor via the tack strips. The strip has two functions: first, the tacks grip the carpet and permanently hold it in place and second, the carpet edge is jammed into the gap between the tack strip and the wall which gives it a finished look with little effort. This method allows a high quality, long lasting installation to be completed quickly and easily.|$|E

If too much water is transferred to the paper, the sheet can change its size between the printing units, due to water absorption, and cause a problem with the colour register. This phenomenon is usually referred to as fanout. In this degree project, an investigation was made to see if the paper dimensions changed through its way in the sheet-fed printing process. The instrument Luchs Register Measuring Systems (Lynx) was used, and a method for measuring if the paper changed its dimensions with this instrument, was developed. Paper qualities with three different grammages were used, 90, 130 and 250 gsm. This investigation showed that all paper qualities changed their size with widening in the <b>gripper</b> <b>edge</b> in the range of 10 - 70 µm and in the trailing edge the increase was 10 - 130 µm. The elongations of the papers were in the range of 10 - 300 µm. The papers with lowest grammage changed more than the heavier. To see if the print had been affected of the widening and elongation, print quality parameters like relative contrast, dot gain and mottle were correlated with the Lynx data from the sheets. The group of papers that gave correlations were in 130 gsm. The sheets had visual doubling and the combined standard deviation from the Lynx marks K 3, K 5 and K 21 correlated with dot gain. When the variations increased so did the dot gain and this indicates that the doubling was due to the widening. There was also a correlation between the standard deviation from K 3 and Mottle. The sheets widened with an average of 30 µm in the <b>gripper</b> <b>edge</b> and since there probably were doubling due to widening it also affected the Mottle values. What the widening depends on is hard to tell. Since widening was so small, it could be due to water absorption, papers being ironed out or maybe the sheets have been flattened out. It probably needs a more detailed investigation to find out what causes the widening. Further investigations about how print quality is affected by the register accuracy of a printing machine should include a print form with measuring areas close to the Lynx marks. The measuring areas should contain fine hairlines, negative text printed with at least two colours and some pictures to evaluate together with standard measuring should give a good knowledge about the subject...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Edge tracing is {{considered}} important for deformable object manipulation {{in order to}} spread and reveal the original shape of an object {{before it can be}} sorted. It is important in unfolding clothes to reveal its original state during sorting. Tracing in this study context involved tracing the clothes edge, with the robot arm movement based on feedback from sensors. Development of special tools for deformable object manipulation is also considered to be important as well and must consider the properties of the deformable objects. Approach: This study introduced three robotic grippers developed to handle clothes for home service robots. For each gripper, a unique tracing algorithm was developed to fully utilize the capability of the gripper in edge tracing. Results: Each developed gripper had been tested and edge tracing algorithms have been developed to suit the gripper’s capabilities. Experimental results demonstrated the uniqueness of each gripper and the effectiveness of the tracing algorithm developed. Conclusion: The results showed that the grippers are capable of tracing the edge of clothes and reveal the second corner of the clothes. Inchworm gripper is proven to be the most promising gripper for clothes manipulation.

50|$|In {{addition}} to vacuum nozzles, mechanical grippers could {{be required for}} handling of some odd-shaped parts. Self-centering mechanical grippers allow simultaneous pickup and automatic centering {{without the need for}} a vacuum. A pair of tweezers-type grippers would hold the part while centering it along one axis. However, there are some disadvantages with self-centering mechanical grippers: {{it is possible that the}} <b>gripper</b> <b>edges</b> could have contact with epoxy or solder paste. In addition, extra space is required between the components to accommodate the grippers.|$|R
