5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896.

Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also {{recognized}} Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E

In this breakout session {{we will discuss}} {{business model}}s from these two values, the emphasis being on the value <b>in</b> the <b>scientific</b> process. This leads to the following questions for discussion: 1. An important characteristic of scientific information {{is that it is}} not an end product <b>in</b> the <b>scientific</b> process but an intermediate product accepted by the scientific community for further scientific scrutiny. Intellectual property should be instrumental here. How should intellectual property impact on business models? 2.

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> studies on animal physiology, and are {{typically}} captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked {{on the design of}} a new machine which would include a floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E

5|$|Curium-244 decays into 240Pu by {{emission}} of alpha particle, {{but it also}} absorbs neutrons resulting in {{a small amount of}} heavier curium isotopes. Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E
