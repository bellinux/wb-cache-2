5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the <b>former</b> <b>air</b> base.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the <b>former,</b> <b>air</b> can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Denver {{has been}} home to several other {{airports}} that are no longer operational. Stapleton International Airport was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. Lowry Air Force Base was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. It is being used for residential purposes. Buckley Air Force Base, a <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> National Guard base, is the only military facility in the Denver area.|$|E

5|$|The time of Rau's German Economic Commission {{ended in}} October 1949 with the {{establishment}} of the East German state, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The GDR was proclaimed on 7October 1949, at a ceremony in the <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> Ministry Building in Berlin, until then the seat of Rau's organisation. Five days later, the DWK was formally abolished on 12October 1949. Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People's Chamber, the newly established parliament of the GDR and joined the new government.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a <b>former</b> <b>air</b> hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican Guard is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E

5|$|The CH-47Ds were {{retired as}} they became due for deep {{maintenance}} checks, {{with the last}} of the type leaving service in September 2016. Due to the large number of common components between the D and F variants, the helicopters were stripped for spare parts before being preserved in Australia. A15-202 was handed over to the Australian War Memorial in April 2016, A15-104 will be displayed at the Australian Army Flying Museum and the <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> Force helicopter A15-106 was transferred to the RAAF Museum. The other three surviving CH-47Ds were retained by the Army for non-flying training: A15-151 and A15-152 are used for general and special forces training respectively and A15-201 serves as a maintenance systems training airframe.|$|E

25|$|On 30 September 2003, Air France and Netherlands-based KLM Royal Dutch Airlines {{announced}} {{the merger of}} the two airlines, the new company {{to be known as}} Air France-KLM. The merger became reality on 5 May 2004. At that point <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> France shareholders owned 81% of the new firm (44% owned by the French state, 37% by private shareholders), former KLM shareholders the rest. The decision of the Jean-Pierre Raffarin government to reduce the French state's shareholding in the <b>former</b> <b>Air</b> France group from 54.4% to 44% of the newly created Air France-KLM Group effectively privatised the new airline. In December 2004 the state sold 18.4% of its equity in Air France-KLM. The state's shareholding in Air France-KLM subsequently fell to just under 20%.|$|E
