5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). Though none of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. However, {{as the years passed}} he became increasingly <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking, the nightclub industry, and parliament by {{the time of his death}} in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The first {{conflict}} between Alberti and Moreno {{was caused by}} the arrival of Gregorio Funes, dean of Córdoba with similar ideas to those of Cornelio Saavedra, president of the Junta. Moreno was keeping an internal dispute with Saavedra, and expected Alberti to write against Funes. He did not, and Moreno made harsh comments about it. Alberti would be further <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> Moreno when the Junta voted for the incorporation of the deputies from other cities into the Junta. At first, both of them opposed the proposal, but Alberti ultimately voted accepting it, stating that he did so just out of political convenience. The Primera Junta was thus turned into the Junta Grande. Mariano Moreno, left in a minority group, resigned.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{achieved}} honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, {{now in the}} ascendancy, {{drove the}} remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> Anne, would henceforth have {{to conform to the}} decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders' downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, spurred on by her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked what was left of their friendship. Sarah was retained in her court position out of necessity as the price to be paid to keep her victorious husband {{at the head of the}} army.|$|E

5|$|Ranariddh {{was born}} in Phnom Penh to Sihanouk and his first wife Phat Kanhol, a ballet dancer {{attached}} to the royal court. Ranariddh was separated from his mother at three years of age when she remarried, and subsequently grew up mostly {{under the care of}} his aunt, Norodom Ketkanya and grandaunt, Norodom Sobhana. Ranariddh attended primary education at Norodom School and completed part of his high school studies at Lycee Descartes in Phnom Penh. During his childhood, he developed a close relationship with his grandparents, Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak, but was <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> his father. In 1958, Ranariddh was sent to a boarding school in Marseille together with his half-brother Norodom Chakrapong. Ranariddh initially planned to pursue medical studies as he did well in science subjects, but was persuaded by Kossamak to study law. After finishing high school in 1961, he enrolled in the undergraduate programme of law at the University of Paris. He struggled to focus on his studies in Paris, which he attributed to the social distractions that he encountered in the city.|$|E
5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the occipital condyle was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The series, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, currently consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, {{was released in}} 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After XIII and Type-0s releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> the series brand for marketing purposes despite retaining thematic connections.|$|E

25|$|Wrestling's {{popularity}} {{experienced a}} dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy and {{status as a}} competitive sport. Wrestlers during the time recount it as largely faked by the 1880s. It also waned due to Gotch's retirement in 1913, and no new wrestling superstar emerging to captivate the audience's attention.|$|E

25|$|In fact, barren mothers often {{call upon}} the spirit to cure their affliction.

The woman will thus {{be less likely to}} become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.|$|E

25|$|In the {{cardiovascular}} system, the pulsation frequency decreases as {{the blood is}} <b>distanced</b> <b>from</b> the origin of pulsation, the heart. However, the Womersley number, like many characteristic numbers, defines a system by order of magnitude (OoM). The pulsation frequency maintains a single OoM throughout the body (<1 s^-1) and is square rooted in the Womersley equation, reducing the OoM further. Therefore, the frequency change in blood flow {{does not affect the}} characteristics defined by the Womersley number.|$|E

Henry sent another army to assist Leo in the Mezzogiorno against the Normans he himself had confirmed in their conquests as his vassal.

25|$|One shift {{caused by}} multi-literate environments is that private-sphere texts {{are being made}} more public.

The family and home are considered {{to be a part of}} the private sphere. Family photographs are an example of multimodality in this sphere. Families take pictures (sometimes captioning them) and compile them in albums that are generally meant to be displayed to other family members or audiences that the family allows. These once private albums are entering the public environment of the Internet more often due to the rapid development and adoption of technology.|$|E
