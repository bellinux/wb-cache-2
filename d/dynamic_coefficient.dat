50|$|The Tortus is now {{the primary}} {{instrument}} for assessing dry slip resistance in the latest Australian slip test standard - AS4586-2013. It has also been endorsed as a secondary standard by Ceramic Tile Institute of America (CTIOA) since 2001, with the pendulum being the primary standard. The advantage of the Tortus, compared to the pendulum, {{is that it can}} perform many slip tests {{in a short period of}} time, dry and wet, using both hard and soft rubbers. It is also difficult for the operator to influence the results of the test (unlike some tribometers) since an electronic button is pushed and then the test is run without any further help from the operator. This makes it a credible forensic science device. CTIOA has endorsed a minimum <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction for level floors of 0.50 using the Tortus slip resistance test method.|$|E
5000|$|The safety {{standards}} ANSI specifies for a level floor using the B101.3 {{dynamic test method}} is that a flooring having a minimum <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction (DCOF) of 0.43 has “high slip resistance”. If the DCOF falls within the 0.30-0.42 range, then the test method states that the flooring is [...] "acceptable, with an increased probability of slipping," [...] and values below 0.30 are categorized as “low slip resistance" [...] and a [...] "higher probability of slipping". The standard also specifies a minimum DCOF of 0.46 for ramps. With an official test method and a safety criterion, this test is useful in determining the anti-slip properties of flooring, helping building owners and managers to avoid future slip and fall accidents (by taking remedial steps to remedy slippery flooring), or help avoid losing a lawsuit based on a fraudulent accident.|$|E

5000|$|The Tortus digital tribometer slip {{resistance}} test method {{is based on}} a proprietary or patented device, which makes it ineligible to become an ASTM standard. It is produced in the U.K., and is in a category of {{slip resistance}} tester devices known as [...] "drag-sled meters", which means that it travels across flooring under its own power at a constant speed with a piece of standardized rubber dragging on the flooring. The amount of friction created by this piece of rubber as it is dragged across the flooring (dry or wet) is recorded and calculated by the machine as it travels a predetermined path length. An average number of <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction (DCOF) is calculated by the machine after its run across the flooring has been completed. This is recorded as the [...] "DCOF", or the amount of friction necessary to drag (dynamic meaning [...] "in motion") the standardized rubber across the flooring. High numbers (e.g. above 0.50) indicate that it is difficult for the machine to drag the rubber across the flooring because it is anti-slip, and low numbers (e.g. below 0.50) means that the rubber easily slides across the flooring and is therefore slippery.|$|E

The equation was proposed that characterizes the evolution of segregation intensity approaching exponentially a certain steady state value. The dependence of the rate of segregation intensity upon <b>dynamic</b> friction <b>coefficient</b> is nonmonotonous: the rate of segregation intensity is higher at lower values of the <b>dynamic</b> friction <b>coefficient</b> and attains a minimum value as the <b>dynamic</b> friction <b>coefficient</b> increases up to μ crit ~ 0. 1, but starts to increase again for the higher values of the <b>dynamic</b> friction <b>coefficient.</b> This dependence indicates the presence of competing segregation mechanisms, one of which dominates at the given experimental conditions and material properties.

40|$|In an unbounded, linearly-elastic, {{compressible}} and isotropic medium {{there is}} a spherical cavity. Its wall is loaded by the time-dependent pres-sure, which generates in the medium a spherical stress wave expanding from the cavity. The influence of the load character on the wave para-meters was studied and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of load was regarded as the main compared parameter. Because of the spherical divergence of the wave, its parameters decrease in the inverse proportion to the square and the cube of {{the distance from the}} cavity center, so their maximum absolute values appear at the cavity wall and, therefore, the analysis was conducted there. For the pressure linearly increasing to the con-stant value two practical limiting values of increase time were found, which determinate three ranges of the load character. In the first, for short times, the load can be considered as surge for which the <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> is the highest. In the third, for long times, the load can be considered as quasi-static, neglecting its dynamic effects. However, in the second range, the load has a transitional character and the parame-ters of the wave generated by it should be determined with the use of precise formulae presented in the paper. The maximum time of acting of the constant pressure pulse, for which the wave parameters do not exce-ed their static values yet, was also determined. However, a significant decrease of the cavity radius was observed as the effect of unloading.

40|$|A {{series of}} primary {{drainage}} experiments {{was carried out}} in order to investigate nonequilibrium capillarity effects in two?phase flow through porous media. Experiments were performed with tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and water as immiscible fluids in a sand column 21 cm long. Four drainage experiments were performed by applying large pressures on the nonwetting phase at the inlet boundary: 20, 30, 35, 38 kPa. Our results showed that the nonequilibrium local fluids pressure difference?saturation curves are above the capillary pressure saturation curve. Moreover, the nonequilibrium pressure difference showed a nonmonotonic behavior with an overshoot that was more pronounced at higher injection pressures. The dynamic capillarity coefficient τ was calculated from measured local pressures and saturations (the scale of sensor devices, 0. 7 cm). Its value was found to vary between 1. 3 × 10 ^ 5 to 2 × 10 ^ 5 Pa s. Within the saturation range of 0. 50 > Sw > 0. 85, no clear dependency of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> on the wetting saturation was observed. Also, no dependency of the dynamic capillarity coefficient on the applied boundary pressure was found. Averaged values of [τ] at the length scales of 11 and 18 cm were also estimated from averaged pressures and saturations. The upscaled <b>dynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> was found to vary between 0. 5 × 10 ^ 6 and 1. 2 × 10 ^ 6 Pa s at the average window size of 11 cm.
