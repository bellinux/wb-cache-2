25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid.</b> I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|He {{tried to}} find support among psychoanalysts in the UK {{so that he could}} settle there, and was interviewed in London by Ernest Jones, Melanie Klein, Joan Riviere and James Strachey. They decided that he had been [...] "insufficiently analysed" [...] and had an {{unresolved}} hostility toward Freud. Anna Freud, Freud's daughter– whom Jones had contacted about Reich's desire to relocate to England– wrote in 1938: [...] "There is a wall somewhere where he stops to understand the other person's point of view and flies off into a world of his own... He is an unhappy person... and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> this will end in sickness." ...|$|E

500|$|Garfield placated the pro-Grant faction by {{endorsing}} Chester A. Arthur as {{nominee for}} Vice President. Despite his {{good relations with}} Arthur in 1879, Sherman thought the choice a bad one: [...] "The nomination of Arthur is a ridiculous burlesque," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> was inspired by a desire to defeat the ticket... His nomination attaches to the ticket all the odium of machine politics, and will greatly endanger the success of Garfield." [...] He was nearly correct, as Garfield eked out a narrow victory over the Democratic nominee Winfield Scott Hancock. Sherman continued at the Treasury for the rest of Hayes's term, leaving office March 3, 1881.|$|E
500|$|Gay film {{historian}} Vito Russo, {{in considering}} Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring {{to him as}} [...] "sissified", [...] "sissy" [...] itself being Hollywood code for [...] "homosexual". Pretorius serves as a [...] "gay Mephistopheles", a figure of seduction and temptation, {{going so far as}} to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of creating non-procreative life. A novelization of the film published in England made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> that there is no course open to me but the scientific way." ...|$|E

Amnesty International protested the arrests of both men, noting Jigme Gyatso {{to be at}} risk of further torture and naming Dhondup Wangchen a prisoner of conscience. Human Rights Watch, Front Line, The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy also advocated on Dhondup Wangchen's behalf. Blogging from under house arrest in Beijing, Tsering Woeser wrote in 2010, [...] "In fact, we are living {{in a country where the}} spiritual has already been undermined, when someone like Dhondup Wangchen who has been the conscience of mankind is consigned to a dark prison, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> the future of this country will sink into hatred and brutality." ...|$|E

She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E

In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries.

[...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{substantial}} {{development of}} Gibraltar's fortifications {{took place during}} the British occupation of the territory from 1704 to the present day. Little was done initially to improve the fortifications, beyond making modest upgrades and repairing the damage caused by the 1704 siege. In 1709, General James Stanhope complained to the Earl of Galway that [...] "the [...] works in general are in a very bad condition, and the money they have cost <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> has been ill laid out", by which he meant that it had been misappropriated. Rather than being spent on the fortifications, the funds had been diverted by corrupt officers to repair their own houses in the town. Other officers were accused of stealing cannons and selling them for profit in Lisbon. Stanhope expressed concern that the prospect of losing Gibraltar was [...] "very practicable" [...] given the poor condition of the defences.|$|E

Nothing was cut [...] I am sorry if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie.
