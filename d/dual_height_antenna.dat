40|$|Abstract—Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{technology}} is being proposed for several short range wireless applications. Some of the applications, such as position location devices for rescue personnel, may require the <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> {{to be close}} to the ground. In scenarios where the <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> is very low (from 0 to 30 cm), propagation characteristics and channel modeling are needed to provide important insights for the application design. This paper presents time-domain measurements and channel characterization of the indoor UWB channel at three different <b>antenna</b> <b>heights</b> (7. 5 cm, 26. 5 cm, and 108. 5 cm). The transmitting and receiving antennas are placed at heights referred to as near ground, middle ground, and above ground. The effects of the <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> on the channel characteristics are analyzed. Both large and small-scale characteristics are evaluated and the results for different <b>antenna</b> <b>heights</b> are compared. The results show that large scale characteristics exhibit monotonic behavior with respect to <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> while small scale characteristics do not follow this behavior. The possible explanations for the obtained results are also discussed. I...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of plate fin heat sinks with dual-height fin profile subject to natural convection is considered. The effect of dual-height configuration, fin spacing and channel length on the thermal {{performance of the}} heat sink is investigated numerically. The {{results show that the}} thermal performance of the dual-height heat sink monotonically decreases as the secondary fin height decreases for a fixed value of the primary fin height. However, the thermal performance per unit mass can be enhanced by decreasing the secondary fin height, suggesting that the <b>dual</b> <b>height</b> heat sink can be considered for various practical applications where the mass of heat sink determines the value of products. It is also shown that there is a threshold value of primary fin height below which the thermal performance of <b>dual</b> <b>height</b> heat sink decreases as the secondary fin height decreases. This threshold value is shown to linearly decrease as the channel length increases...|$|R

40|$|Rockbolting {{telltales}} are now {{an internationally}} established means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The <b>dual</b> <b>height</b> telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the rockbolted height, is the most widespread version. The <b>dual</b> <b>height</b> telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as rockbolting was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height telltales are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading <b>dual</b> <b>height</b> telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic telltales to be connected with a twin core cable and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection. In the latter configuration, a real time display of roof condition is obtained whilst retaining the immediate visual indication underground. A recent development is the “Autowarning” telltale. This provides a warning of impending goafing in depillaring operations via high visibility, flashing LEDs. The paper describes these and other telltale developments and provides case histories of their application worldwide, including UK, India, and USA...|$|R
40|$|Several {{research}} efforts {{as well as}} deployments have chosen IEEE 802. 11 as a low-cost, long-distance access technology to bridge the digital divide. In this paper, we consider the important issue of planning such networks to minimize the system cost. This is a non-trivial task since it involves several sets of variables: the network topology, tower <b>heights,</b> <b>antenna</b> types to be used and their orientations, and radio transmit powers. The task is further complicated due {{to the presence of}} network performance constraints, and the inter-dependence among the variables. Our first contribution in this paper is the formulation of this problem in terms of the variables, constraints and the optimization criterion. Our second contribution is in identifying the dependencies among the variables and breaking-down the problem into four tractable sub-parts. In this process, we extensively use domain knowledge {{to strike a balance between}} tractability and practicality. We have evaluated the proposed algorithms using random input sets as well as real-life instances with success. We have been able to show detailed planning of network topology, required tower <b>heights,</b> <b>antenna</b> types, and transmit powers for the Ashwini project, a long distance WiFi network under deployment in Andhra Pradesh, India. In this case, we are able to achieve within 2 % of a lower bound cost estimate. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An optimal {{power and}} <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> {{determination}} {{over a wide}} range of incidence angles is proposed for in-orbit operations of the spaceborne stripmap synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with variable <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> and variable radiating el-ement power. The <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> and the average transmitted radio-frequency power of a radiating element for each incidence angle are determined so that the mapping area can be maximized with the constraints on the signal-to-noise ratio, ambiguities, and swath width, given the SAR geometry (an altitude and incidence angles) and radar wavelength. With the receive-chain power consumption of one transmit/receive module (= 10 mW) and the SAR instrument power consumption without the phased array antenna (= 5 W), the illustrative design example shows that the mapping area of the proposed SAR for the maximum incidence angle (max = 75) is about 269. 1 % of that resulted from utilizing only the variable <b>antenna</b> <b>height.</b> The proposed optimization would have a more beneficial effect on applications that need the high-incidence-angle operations.
