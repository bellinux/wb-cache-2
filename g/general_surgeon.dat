5|$|The five {{characters}} who are first {{introduced in the}} series premiere, as surgical interns, are Grey, Karev, O'Malley, Stevens, and Yang.

5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed <b>general</b> <b>surgeon</b> named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{critically}} {{the results}} of using three different approaches to planning {{for the number of}} <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> in rural areas. DESIGN: Estimates of the number of <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> needed using a ratio approach, a and a population-needs-based approach. SETTING: Rural southern Manitoba. OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> needed. RESULTS: The ratio approach supported the recruitment of 7. 8 to 14. 5 additional <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> to rural southern Manitoba. The repatriation approach suggested that the area might support five additional <b>general</b> <b>surgeons,</b> if residents could be persuaded to undergo their surgery closer to home. The population-needs-based approach suggested that the health status of area residents was similar to that of residents of other areas of the province and that they had a higher rate of surgery than residents of other areas; no additional surgeons were apparently needed. CONCLUSIONS: Each method has certain advantages, and none is necessarily useful in isolation. Hence, the most effective approach to planning for <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> is likely a combination of all three methods. Other factors that may be important include the type of payment structure and the need for professional groups to monitor variations in rates of surgery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>General</b> <b>surgeons</b> form {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the medical workforce in rural areas of the United States. Any decline in their numbers could have profound effects on access to adequate health care in such areas. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the rural areas of the United States are relatively undersupplied with <b>general</b> <b>surgeons.</b> DESIGN AND SETTING: The American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile was used to identify all clinically active <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> {{as well as their}} locations and characteristics. Their geographic distribution was examined using the ZIP code version of the Rural-Urban Commuting Areas. Surgeons were classified as practicing in urban areas, large rural areas, or small/isolated rural areas. RESULTS: There are currently 17 243 <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> practicing in the United States. Nationally, the number of <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> per population of 100 000 varies from 6. 53 in urban areas to 7. 71 in large rural areas and 4. 67 in small/isolated rural areas. Only 10. 6 % of the nation's <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> are female. Wide variations in numbers of <b>general</b> <b>surgeons</b> were found between and within individual states. <b>General</b> <b>surgeons</b> in the smallest rural areas are more likely than those in urban areas to be male (92. 7 % vs 88. 3 %, P<. 001), 50 years of age or older (51. 6 % vs 42. 1 %, P<. 001), or international medical graduates (25. 2 % vs 20. 1 %, P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The overall size of the rural general surgical workforce has remained static over the last decade, but its demographic characteristics suggest that numbers will decline. Many rural residents have limited access to surgical services. Steps to reverse this trend are needed to preserve the viability of health care in many parts of rural America...|$|R

25|$|In 1823, {{he started}} the now {{well-known}} medical weekly, The Lancet, with William Cobbett, William Lawrence, James Wardrop and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper, the <b>General</b> <b>Surgeon)</b> of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a bladder stone through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's William Cheselden, but Cooper took {{more than an hour}} and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, Cooper v Wakley, which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an acknowledgment that Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{surgical}} trainees enter training {{after five}} years of medical school and two years of the Foundation Programme. During the two to three-year core training programme, doctors will sit the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. On award of the MRCS examination, surgeons may hold the title 'Mister' or 'Miss/Ms' rather than doctor. This is a tradition dating back hundreds of years in the United Kingdom. Trainees will then go onto Higher Surgical Training (HST), lasting a further five to six years. During this time they may choose to subspecialise. Before the end of HST, the examination of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) must be taken in general surgery plus the subspeciality. Upon completion of training, the surgeon will become a consultant surgeon and will be eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register and may work both in the NHS and independent sector as a consultant <b>general</b> <b>surgeon.</b> The implementation of the European Working Time Directive limited UK surgical residents to a 48-hour working week.
