5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or <b>ignore</b> the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to <b>ignore</b> or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this poster is planned <b>ignoring.</b> The {{purpose of this}} poster was to answer the {{question}} of how planned <b>ignoring</b> can be used effectively. Planned <b>ignoring</b> is defined as purposely <b>ignoring</b> an individual who is demonstrating an undesirable behavior. When using planned <b>ignoring,</b> the subject should not be told that planned <b>ignoring</b> is being used. Results of eliminated behavior will not always be revealed immediately. The target behavior may potentially escalate before effective results are demonstrated. It is recommended that planned <b>ignoring</b> not be used with all behaviors such as, if an individual is causing harm to himself or others, the problem should be addressed with a different strategy. According to the research, planned <b>ignoring</b> appears to be effective when employed in classroom settings...|$|R

5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to <b>ignore</b> the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Pressman {{has argued}} that Robert Nozick's {{position}} on the justice of government redistribution programs, which is put into concrete terms with his famous Wilt Chamberlain example, is badly flawed for four reasons - it <b>ignores</b> actual history, yet purports to be a historical theory of justice, it <b>ignores</b> empirical evidence on justice, it <b>ignores</b> the social nature of production and it <b>ignores</b> the future.|$|R

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also <b>ignore</b> aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to <b>ignore</b> those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a choice}} experiment, this paper investigates how Swedish {{citizens}} value three environmental quality objectives. In addition, a follow-up question {{is used to}} investigate whether respondents <b>ignored</b> any attributes when responding. The resulting information is used in model estimation by restricting the individual parameters for the <b>ignored</b> attributes to zero. When taking the shares of respondents who took both the environmental and the cost attributes (52 - 69 % of the respondents) into account, then the WTP for each attribute changes if the respondents who <b>ignored</b> the attributes have a zero WTP. At the same time, we find evidence that not all respondents {{who claimed to have}} <b>ignored</b> an attribute really did. However, the most commonly <b>ignored</b> non-monetary attributes always have the lowest rankings in terms of WTP across all three environmental objectives. Thus, our results show that instead of <b>ignoring</b> attributes completely, respondents seem to put less weight on the attributes they claimed to have <b>ignored...</b>|$|R

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically <b>ignore</b> each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Cobb has {{consistently}} opposed the splitting {{of education and}} knowledge into discrete and insulated disciplines and departments. He believes that the current university model encourages excessive abstraction because each specialized area of study defines its own frame of reference and then tends to <b>ignore</b> the others, discouraging interdisciplinary dialogue and inhibiting a broad understanding of the world.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but <b>ignore</b> other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the effect}} of <b>ignoring</b> one or more levels of {{variation}} in hierarchical linear regression analysis is explored. A model with four hierarchical levels {{is used as a}} reference model. A distinction is made between <b>ignoring</b> top and intermediate levels. The effects of <b>ignoring</b> levels on the fixed and on the random parameters of different random intercept models are explored by means of a real data set. The results show that <b>ignoring</b> an important level causes an effect on specific fixed coefficients, variance components and their corresponding standard error. Therefore, <b>ignoring</b> an important level can lead to different research conclusions. status: publishe...|$|R

As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice {{as well as his}} own and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|Impossible to <b>ignore</b> was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted}} that Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E

At about this time Cassandra could no longer <b>ignore</b> that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{resource}} constraints, {{the existing}} prioritization and selection techniques for software security requirements (countermeasures) find {{a subset of}} higher-priority security requirements <b>ignoring</b> lower-priority requirements or postponing them to the future releases. <b>Ignoring</b> or postponing security requirements however, may on one hand leave some of the security threats (vulnerabilities) unattended {{and on the other}} hand influence other security requirements that rely on the <b>ignored</b> or postponed requirements. To address this, we have proposed considering partial satisfaction of security requirements when tolerated rather than <b>ignoring</b> those requirements or postponing them to the future. In doing so, we have contributed a goal-based framework that enables prioritization and partial selection of security requirements with respect to security goals. The proposed framework helps reduce the number of <b>ignored</b> (postponed) security requirements and consequently reduce the adverse impacts of <b>ignoring</b> security requirements in software products...|$|R
