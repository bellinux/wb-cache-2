500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to {{imagine what it would be}} like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for our next film." ...|$|E
500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E
2500|$|An {{episode of}} Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps {{entitled}} [...] "War, Hurrgh!" [...] contains references to Peggy and Grant Mitchell, Angie Watts and Pat Butcher.

[...] referred to Pauline and Martin Fowler, and the episode [...] "Finger Sniffing" [...] also refers to Peggy. Also, in the episode [...] "When Janet Met Johnny", Donna sings the line [...] "Don't stay in watching EastEnders." [...] Also, in an episode of Pulling, the character of Donna asks [...] "Who am I going to tell when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a new plotline in EastEnders?".|$|E

2500|$|Cryer {{was elected}} {{mayor of the}} City of Los Angeles in 1921 in a close {{election}} against the incumbent Meredith P. Snyder. [...] Cryer's campaign promised to close the [...] "dens of vice," [...] and attacked Snyder as being corrupt and unfit to be mayor. [...] The Los Angeles Police Commissioner sent a telegram to the newspapers before the election asking, [...] "Shall crime and protected vice continue, or will the voters and taxpayers elect George E. Cryer mayor?" [...] Cryer billed himself as a non-politician: [...] "I know nothing about politics, and I shall never be a politician. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that {{the business of the}} City of Los Angeles can be conducted like any other business ... quietly, effectively, efficiently." [...] The Los Angeles Times backed Cryer, noting, [...] "To talk with George E. Cryer is to know instinctively that he is not a politician clutching at straws for a 'platform,' but that he is a quiet, effective man who does things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, haven't {{you some}} snug {{secretarial}} job {{you could put}} me into? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I should make an ideal secretary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought you}} did. Well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> which will drag these people like a magnet. I thought it out coming {{down in the}} train.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> she {{was getting}} angry with me. She did not say so. I {{gathered}} it. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to explain myself somehow.|$|R
60|$|So I shambled in {{and looked}} timidly round at the clerks. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that <b>a</b> person {{about to open}} an account must needs consult the manager.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of my own. I said, as if {{speaking}} to myself: [...] "I {{would give a}} five pound note {{to know what is}} going on upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. To be truthful, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> it's bad {{temper and}} lack of patience. Just {{wait till you see}} this Navajo go at Silvermane!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{hope for}} the best, Mrs. Rogers," [...] said Beth. [...] "Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> this trouble will all turn out well in the end." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> special {{affection for}} this book. Hubbard {{was a great}} writer, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the movies potential, a fantasy {{in my mind that}} lasted for years. John Travolta ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{that these}} words might have {{reference}} to my foolishness {{of the night}} previous, and did not seek to learn what Major Clarke had been warning him against.|$|R
60|$|S. M-m. That's bad. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that they'd get lonesome, {{and have}} to seek society; and then, of course, my plan would work, {{considering}} the cast-iron conditions of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} to {{contradict}} you," [...] said the Yellow Hen, with dignity, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> I know more about chickens than human beings do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Really," [...] he declared, [...] "this is most agreeable. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> Mr. Dunster, that I {{should find}} you a {{reasonable}} person. Men of your eminence in their profession usually are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he said. [...] "Yes! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{that was}} it. But I think I'd {{like to have}} it once again, slowly. Start with these figures. What does that sixty-seven mean, {{opposite}} Hayward's name?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{made this}} last remark in a mournful voice, {{but there was}} a gleam in his eye which belied its melancholy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> Sir Henry Curtis {{actually}} likes fighting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt {{a little}} shiver," [...] she confided. [...] "I don't know why. I loathe those two men father has here, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> somehow, that they don't like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say two pounds," [...] he replied. [...] "With {{my three}} we {{could set up}} an {{establishment}} of our own. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that is original. Shall we work it out together?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I hoped you'd do. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> you hadn't seen much of him since your marriage, {{that in fact}} your {{relations}} were a--a little more formal. That's why I hesitated--like an awkward Briton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'But, Mr. Twitty,' said Mrs. Sickles, 'this is so unexpected. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of {{the kind}} about Cap'n Abner, for I could not help it, but you--really! I've heard of you often, Mr. Twitty, but I never saw you until to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{but this}} suits {{me down to}} the ground!" [...] cried the senator's son, after the boys had said good-night to the others. [...] "It's a {{complete}} surprise. Like Jessie, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> we'd <b>have</b> to rough it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that, by any chance, {{one of our}} missing guests, Captain Holderness?" [...] she inquired, turning towards him. [...] "I don't know why, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that it is your sister." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{must try}} {{in some way}} {{to get her out of}} this stupor, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> Have you noticed that Mr. Wells has failed very much in the last few weeks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] said Mr. Chipperton, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bite {{just at that}} minute; and, besides, I {{really did}} not look for you on such <b>a</b> little boat. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> you would come on {{something}} more respectable than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's Rajah Hassim coming, Jorgenson. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{he would}} perhaps stay outside."

60|$|I {{went into}} Hoodoo's room quite early Christmas morning. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that the scene would be interesting. I woke {{him up and}} he sat up in bed, his eyes glistening with radiant expectation, and began hauling things out of his stocking.|$|R
