5|$|In St. Joseph Marquis {{worked for}} various newspapers, {{including}} the St. Joseph Daily News, the St. Joseph Gazette, and the St. Joseph Herald. It seems that work was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> as many printworkers {{had left the}} city after the printworkers union achieved a closed shop.|$|E
5|$|Josh Weinstein {{has said}} {{that there are so many}} sleazy {{characters}} in The Simpsons that it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> people for the scenes in the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E
5|$|As it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and kill, the quagga was hunted {{by early}} Dutch {{settlers}} {{and later by}} Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, {{and it may have}} competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

5|$|Academic jobs {{in history}} were not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in 1941, so Elliott joined the Civil Service, {{working in the}} Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control {{directorate}} in the Ministry of Supply. She subsequently moved to the Board of Trade, and the Directorate of Housing Fitments, where she rose {{to the rank of}} Assistant Principal, before moving to the Cabinet Office in 1945. There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War, as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History. As an official historian of the History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Civil Series, Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files. She came to know personally many of the politicians and senior civil servants involved.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E

5000|$|Volksrods are {{modified}} Volkswagen beetles. They {{are used}} {{as an alternative to}} traditional Ford-based hot rods. Classic Ford Model Ts and Model As are becoming more scarce and more valuable than ever. VW Beetles are much more affordable, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> parts for. It is also a 1930s design, which is well-suited to hot-rodding's roots & tradition.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{aware of}} these critiques, for a time, Google had Area 51 (which is highly visible and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find)</b> in Nevada as a default placemark when Google Earth is first installed.|$|E
25|$|Between {{tracks on}} the {{recorded}} section of an LP record {{there is usually}} a short gap of around 1mm (0.04in) where the groove is widely spaced. This space is clearly visible, making it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a particular track.|$|E

25|$|Tritium is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} radiolabel. It has the advantage that almost all organic chemicals contain hydrogen, making it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a place to put}} tritium on the molecule under investigation. It has the disadvantage of producing a comparatively weak signal.|$|E
25|$|We {{have had}} notable results in hitting the targets near the front, {{especially}} in bombing villages which hold enemy reserves and headquarters. We have had great success because these targets are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{and can be}} thoroughly destroyed by carpet bombing.|$|E
25|$|A 2003 Human Rights Watch report claimed {{children}} as young as five years old were employed and worked for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in silk industry.

25|$|Testing {{whether a}} graph {{contains}} two maximal independent sets {{of different sizes}} is NP-complete; that is, complementarily, testing whether a graph is well-covered is coNP-complete. Although it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> maximum independent sets in graphs that {{are known to be}} well-covered, it is also NP-hard for an algorithm to produce as output, on all graphs, either a maximum independent set or a guarantee that the input is not well-covered.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for medical training programs is recruitment of GTAs and MUTAs. It is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> potential teaching assistants who are healthy, {{are capable of}} instructing students well, and are comfortable with having their breasts or genital areas palpated by medical students. A 2016 survey of Canadian medical schools found that only 65% {{of the students had}} performed a urogenital examination on a patient during their introductory clinical skills sessions.|$|E
25|$|High {{turnover}} {{often means}} that employees are {{dissatisfied with their}} jobs, especially when it is relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new one. It can also indicate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, or that too few employees give satisfactory performance (due to unrealistic expectations, inappropriate processes or tools, or poor candidate screening). The lack of career opportunities and challenges, dissatisfaction with the job-scope or conflict with the management have been cited as predictors of high turnover.|$|E

25|$|The {{connection}} between Poland and Hungary is dated to the 12th century, when the Piast and Árpád dynasty were cooperating. From that time royal families {{of both countries}} were family related through several marriages between ruling houses. It was therefore <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Hungarian nobles in Poland and Polish nobles in Hungary and Slovakia. Abel Biel {{was the first of}} the Ostojas to serve on the Hungarian Court, and was also the first to receive land in Upper Hungary.|$|E
25|$|The park {{tries to}} {{simultaneously}} encourage and control tourism, since the park's nature would not resist a massive flow of tourists. Accordingly {{there are six}} small camping sites and several hikingtrails are marked, making it relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{many of the most}} interesting spots, such as the castros at Castro Laboreiro and Calcedónia and the monastery at Pitões das Júnias. The trail at Mézio as a particular concern in describing some of the local features.|$|E
25|$|Substitution tiling systems {{provide a}} rich source of {{aperiodic}} tilings. A set of tiles that forces a substitution structure to emerge is said to enforce the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at right below. These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in precisely the same manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic—it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles.|$|E
