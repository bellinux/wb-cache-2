5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} <b>dosimeters</b> for {{measuring}} ionizing radiation. Crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge <b>dosimeters</b> were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{radiation}} {{absorbed dose}} {{is the amount}} energy absorbed per unit weight of the target material. Dose is used because, when the same substance is given the same dose, similar changes are observed in the target material. The SI unit for dose is grays (Gy or J/kg). <b>Dosimeters</b> are used to measure dose, and are small components that, when exposed to ionizing radiation, change measurable physical attributes {{to a degree that}} can be correlated to the dose received. Measuring dose (dosimetry) involves exposing one or more <b>dosimeters</b> along with the target material.|$|E
40|$|A {{container}} for a self-reading pocket <b>dosimeter</b> includes a transparent tube for receiving the self-reading pocket <b>dosimeter,</b> a light source mounted {{at one end}} of the transparent tube, and an eyepiece mounted on an opposite end of the transparent tube for viewing a read-out of the self-reading pocket <b>dosimeter.</b> The container may further include an activation device for selectively supplying power to the light source. The container both protects the <b>dosimeter</b> from being contaminated and provides a light source for viewing the <b>dosimeter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Standard <b>dosimeter</b> reader, {{modified}} by adding an electronic gating circuit {{to trigger the}} intensity level photomultiplier, increases readout sensitivity of photoluminescent <b>dosimeter</b> systems. The gating circuit is controlled by a second photomultiplier which senses a short ultraviolet pulse from a laser used to excite the <b>dosimeter...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{film badge}} <b>dosimeter</b> or film badge is a {{personal}} <b>dosimeter</b> used for monitoring cumulative radiation dose due to ionizing radiation.|$|R
25|$|Similar {{to other}} countries, they {{work within the}} areas of {{radiography}} diagnostics (CT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, digital subtraction angiography), radiation therapy, radiation <b>dosimeters</b> and nuclear medicine.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{when the}} food is being irradiated, pallets of food are exposed to a source of {{radiation}} for a specific time. <b>Dosimeters</b> are placed on the pallet (at various locations) of food {{to serve as a}} check and ensure that the correct dose was achieved.|$|E
25|$|The workers wore hazmat {{suits and}} hazmat masks, {{carrying}} <b>dosimeters</b> that alerted at 80 millisieverts. Each worker {{had to stop}} the operation once the dosimeter alerted. According to TEPCO, seven TEPCO workers were exposed to radiation over the limit of 100 millisievert by the morning of 20 March.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} monitor the absorbed dose of goods in 60 Co γ-rays and {{electron}} beams, a new label <b>dosimeter</b> had been developed for dose measurements. The label <b>dosimeter</b> had a multilayer structure, and the core {{of which was a}} layer of radiochromic film. The radiochromic film contained acid-sensitive dye and halogen compound in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),and the dosimetry of the film <b>dosimeter</b> was studied, the result showed that the <b>dosimeter</b> was satisfied for daily radiation business. ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Dosimeter</b> pocket meters {{were issued}} to {{individual}} observers for measuring their personal levels of radiation absorption during operations. Three different grades of <b>dosimeter</b> were used, depending on ambient radiation levels. The original hand wound and temperamental <b>dosimeter</b> charging units were replaced during the 1980s by battery operated automatic charging units.|$|R
40|$|To {{create an}} optical density map of 3 D <b>dosimeter</b> phantoms, {{the ratio of}} the {{transmission}} profile (either a line or planar) acquired after irradiation of the <b>dosimeter</b> and a pre-irradiation reference scan of the same <b>dosimeter</b> phantom is taken. Any uncertainty in repositioning of the phantom may result in an uncertainty in the optical density map and finally also in the derived dose maps. Correct repositioning is paramount when scanning noncylindrical <b>dosimeter</b> phantoms as any repositioning error will give rise to severe imaging artifacts. We hereby propose a different scanning technique that does not require any repositioning of the <b>dosimeter</b> phantom. In this method, no pre-irradiation san is recorded but the <b>dosimeter</b> phantom is scanned twice with light at two different wavelengths. It is demonstrated that this method is accurate in scanning non-cylindrical anthropomorphic shaped phantoms. 4 page(s...|$|R
25|$|Tomohiko Hideta, an {{official}} of the Reconstruction Agency, said that {{it would be impossible to}} reach the official targets, and confirmed the offer of the <b>dosimeters.</b> However, spokesmen for the Japanese Ministry of Environment denied all, even when they were confronted with the existence of audio recordings of the meeting that proved otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{results were}} {{obtained}} for a three-month period from September 2011: {{among a group of}} 36,767 residents in Fukushima city, 36,657 had been exposed to less than 1 millisievert, and the average dose was 0.26 millisieverts. For 10 residents, the readings ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 millisieverts, but these values are mostly believed to be related to usage errors (<b>dosimeters</b> left outside or exposed to X-ray luggage screening).|$|E
25|$|Detectors can {{be divided}} into two major categories: imaging {{detectors}} (such as photographic plates and X-ray film (photographic film), now mostly replaced by various digitizing devices like image plates or flat panel detectors) and dose measurement devices (such as ionization chambers, Geiger counters, and <b>dosimeters</b> used to measure the local radiation exposure, dose, and/or dose rate, for example, for verifying that radiation protection equipment and procedures are effective on an ongoing basis).|$|E
50|$|The safety {{equipment}} usually includes four basic items: a radiation survey meter (such as a Geiger/Mueller counter), an alarming <b>dosimeter</b> or rate meter, a gas-charged <b>dosimeter,</b> and a film badge or thermoluminescent <b>dosimeter</b> (TLD). The {{easiest way to}} remember what each of these items does is to compare them to gauges on an automobile.|$|R
40|$|A new {{inhalation}} synchronised <b>dosimeter</b> {{triggered by}} low inspiratory flow rates has been assessed. The methacholine challenge test using <b>dosimeter</b> nebulisation with controlled tidal breathing was compared with continuous nebulisation using De Vilbiss No 40 nebulisers with deep inhalations in 11 asthmatic subjects. Within subject PD 20 FEV 1 values were lower with the <b>dosimeter</b> method {{than with the}} continuous nebulisation method (geometric means 158 and 588 micrograms). The repeatability of the <b>dosimeter</b> method with controlled tidal breathing was studied in 11 asthmatic subjects, and the 95 % range for a single measurement was +/- 0. 72 doubling doses of methacholine. The <b>dosimeter</b> method has greater efficacy because aerosol is delivered during {{the first part of}} an inhalation, minimising loss of aerosol outside the respiratory tract. The <b>dosimeter</b> technique combined with controlled tidal breathing appears to be a useful method for carrying out standardised non-specific bronchoprovocation tests...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the press}} release and media {{coverage}} of the patent # 7781747 entitled “Very thin <b>dosimeter</b> filters and low profile <b>dosimeter</b> incorporating the same,” dubbed the Citizen’s <b>Dosimeter,</b> this high-tech plastic card would be as convenient and affordable as a subway card, with the capability to measure the amount of radiation on a person or in a given area.|$|R
25|$|On , {{during the}} yearly {{revision}} of Beznau 2, two workers {{were exposed to}} excessive levels of radiation because {{of a series of}} organizational flaws and uncoordinated handling by another revision team. These lead to a sudden increase in radiation levels in the room where the two technicians were working. They absorbed an equivalent dose of 37.8 and 25.4 mSv, respectively (see examples for radiation doses). Incorrect settings of personal <b>dosimeters</b> prevented a timely warning.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{detectors}} vary {{in shape}} and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while <b>dosimeters</b> are {{used to measure the}} radiation dose a person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered {{desalination}} plants where deserts met the sea to provide water. The project called Water for Peace was backed by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and presented at a 1964 United Nations conference but increases in the cost of construction and public confidence in nuclear power falling caused the plan to fail. The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate dosage limits, <b>dosimeters</b> and improved radiation shielding.|$|E
5000|$|The 1958-1959 [...] "Quartz Fibre <b>Dosimeter</b> Chargers, No. 1 and 2" [...] were {{retained}} {{until the early}} 1990s, as they incorporate a simple, handle-driven generator and do not require batteries at all. A later British civil defence <b>dosimeter</b> charger was developed by R. A. Stephen Ltd and manufactured from 1967 to 1988, and uses a single 1.5 volt cell. It is similar to American <b>dosimeter</b> chargers.|$|R

The <b>dosimeter</b> contains features enabling the monitoring and evaluating of radiological risks so that a user can concentrate on the task at hand. The <b>dosimeter</b> provides an audible alarm indication that a predetermined time period has elapsed, an audible alarm indication reminding the user to check the <b>dosimeter</b> indication periodically, an audible alarm indicating that a predetermined accumulated dose has been prematurely reached, and an audible alarm indication prior or to reaching the 3 / 4 scale point...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A fiber-optic <b>dosimeter</b> was {{developed}} using a plastic scintillating fiber, a plastic optical fiber, and a photomultiplier tube for measuring entrance surface dose over the low-energy range which {{is interested in}} diagnostic radiology. To evaluate the fabricated fiber-optic <b>dosimeter,</b> the scintillating light signals were measured by changing the current-time product whose values were determined by tube current and irradiation time of a digital radiography system. In conclusion, the trend of scintillating light signals of the fiber-optic <b>dosimeter</b> was similar {{with that of the}} entrance surface doses of a commercially available semiconductor <b>dosimeter</b> according to the current-time product...|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{resources}} poured into analyzing crustal movements and having expert committees determine earthquake risk, for instance, researchers never {{considered the possibility}} of a magnitude-9 earthquake followed by a massive tsunami. The failure of multiple safety features on nuclear power plants has raised questions about the nation's engineering prowess. Government flip-flopping on acceptable levels of radiation exposure confused the public, and health professionals provided little guidance. Facing a dearth of reliable information on radiation levels, citizens armed themselves with <b>dosimeters,</b> pooled data, and together produced radiological contamination maps far more detailed than anything the government or official scientific sources ever provided.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2011 the Japanese {{government}} {{took up the}} plan to increase the 30 members of {{the staff at the}} Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with <b>dosimeters</b> and protection outfits for field studies. The extra costs of the additional embassy staff was estimated at 200 million yen.|$|E
500|$|The Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set {{standards}} for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but {{this could be}} too late. Personal quartz fiber <b>dosimeters</b> were procured, as were film badge <b>dosimeters,</b> which recorded cumulative dosage. Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable Geiger counters. Herbert M. Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the roentgen equivalent man or rem. After the war, this replaced the roentgen as the standard measure of radiation exposure. Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium [...] at the Clinton Engineer Works began producing it in 1943. The project {{set a limit of}} 5 micrograms (μg) in the body, and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified to ensure that this standard was met.|$|E
40|$|A UVB {{specific}} <b>dosimeter</b> {{is described}} comprising: a redox dye (2, 6 -dichloroindophenol, DCIP), a semiconductor (tin(IV) oxide, SnO 2) and a sacrificial electron donor (glycerol) dispersed in a polymer (hydroxy ethyl cellulose, HEC) film. The <b>dosimeter</b> is {{blue in the}} absence of UVB light but rapidly loses colour on exposure to UVB light. The spectral characteristics of a typical UVB <b>dosimeter</b> film and the mechanism by which the colour change occurs are detailed. DCIP UVB <b>dosimeter</b> films exhibit a response that is related to the irradiance level and duration of UVB exposure, the level of SnO 2 present {{and to a lesser extent}} the level of glycerol present. The response of the <b>dosimeter</b> appears to be independent of dye concentration and film thickness. Furthermore, DCIP UVB <b>dosimeter</b> films respond to solar simulated light, exhibiting a colour loss that can be simply related to the Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) exposure for skin type II. As a consequence, such indicators have potential for measuring solar radiation exposure and providing an early warning of erythema for most Caucasian skin (i. e. skin type II) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a blue light (VISBL) <b>dosimeter.</b> The VISBL <b>dosimeter</b> is based on the combination of polysulfone and phenothiazine as a potential VISBL <b>dosimeter</b> for population studies of exposures related to the blue light hazard. This research found that this combination of photosensitive chromophores reacts to both ultraviolet and visible wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Further to this, the majority of the ultraviolet wavelengths below 380 nm can be filtered out {{with the use of a}} low pass filter. It was found that a large change in optical absorbance at 437 nm occurred when the <b>dosimeter</b> was employed to quantify the solar blue light hazard exposures. Preliminary results indicate that this <b>dosimeter</b> saturates relatively slowly and is able to measure exposures equivalent to more than 1200 kJ/m 2 of blue light hazard weighted solar radiation. ...|$|R

In {{order to}} test the {{response}} of radiation-induced current with wide range of dose rate, a Silicon Carbide (SiC) <b>dosimeter</b> is exposed to gamma-rays emitted from a 60 Co source. The SiC <b>dosimeter</b> {{in this study is}} made of a high purity semi-insulating 4 H-SiC with nickel and aluminum electrodes. We have successfully demonstrated that the radiation-induced currents in the <b>dosimeter</b> show a linear relationship with the dose rate, and are repeatable and stable...|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to these casualties, 1,872 people living within [...] of the scrapyard were potentially exposed to different levels of ionizing radiation. Physical exams and blood tests were provided to nearly half these people, who sought medical attention. Radiation doses received by OAEP personnel working to recover the radiation source did not exceed 32 mSv, as measured by individual thermoluminescent <b>dosimeters.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 18,875 film badge <b>dosimeters</b> were issued to {{personnel}} during the operation. About 6,596 <b>dosimeters</b> {{were given to}} personnel who {{were based on the}} nearby islands or support ships that had no potential for radiation exposure. The rest were issued to all of the individuals thought to be at the greatest risk for radiological contamination along with a percentage of each group who were working in less contaminated areas. Personnel were removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure if their badges showed more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day exposure. This is [...] about the same as the annual occupational dose limit in practice at many modern U.S. nuclear facilities. Experts believed at the time that this radiation dose could be tolerated by individuals for long periods without any harmful effects. The maximum accumulated dose of 3.72 R was received by a radiation safety monitor.|$|E
500|$|Radioactively [...] "hot" [...] {{areas were}} {{predicted}} in advance, and then checked with Geiger counters, sometimes by remote control, {{to see if}} they were safe. The level of measured gamma radiation determined how long personnel could operate in them without exceeding the allowable daily dose. Instant gamma readings were taken by radiation safety specialists, but film-badge <b>dosimeters,</b> which could be read {{at the end of the}} day, were issued to all personnel believed to be at the greatest radiological risk. Anyone whose badge showed more than 0.1 R per day exposure was removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure. The maximum accumulated exposure recorded was 3.72R, received by a radiation safety specialist.|$|E
