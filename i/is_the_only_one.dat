5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E

5|$|Although no manager {{has ever}} won {{all of these}} competitions, Trapattoni <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to have claim the title of five {{different}} confederation tournaments. Trapattoni and German Udo Lattek are the only managers to have won at least once the three seasonal UEFA competitions: the European Cup, the Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Cup.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, {{it has been suggested}} that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E

5|$|Sea World Aquarium is {{a natural}} habitat lying {{opposite}} to the Rameswaram Bus Stand, having an assortment of underwater creatures – it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{of its kind in}} the state, filled with such varied marine life forms including exotic species.|$|E
5|$|Serpens <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the 88 modern constellations to {{be split}} into two {{disconnected}} regions in the sky: Serpens Caput (the head) and Serpens Cauda (the tail). The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, {{the last}} Druid Allanon arrives in Shady Vale. Allanon warns the Ohmsford {{brothers}} that the Warlock Lord {{has returned to}} the Skull Kingdom in the Northland and is coming for Shea.

5|$|The ferry, and {{subsequently}} the bridge, {{is located at}} the narrowest section of Skarnsundet, between the villages of Kjerringvik and Vangshylla. In addition to Mosvik, the bridge also caters for the larger municipality Leksvik, further out along the fjord. The bridge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to cross the Trondheimsfjord.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often {{took the form of}} knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E

Homer tells Mr. Burns that it is Maggie's now, and she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that can return it. Mr. Burns decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, {{in an act of}} pity, lets the desperate Mr. Burns have the bear.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{became the}} first manager who held the title of manager for the Indians {{for more than one}} season. Boudreau has managed more games (1383) than any other Indians manager, closely {{followed}} by Hargrove (1364). Charlie Manuel, Eric Wedge, Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, and Hargrove are the only managers to have led the Indians into the playoffs. Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, Walter Johnson, Joe Gordon, Nap Lajoie and Frank Robinson are the seven members of the Baseball Hall of Fame who are also former managers of this club. Of those seven, Lopez <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> inducted as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Building {{on what is}} now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street. Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E

30|$|For the 25 / 75 mixtures, <b>the</b> {{diesel oil}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> four tested oils which {{separated}} rapidly from the drilling fluids. In other cases, water-wetting emulsions were formed {{which did not}} break within 2  h. <b>The</b> mixtures <b>were</b> cream-like and contained large globules. Of all the tested oils, diesel <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> with a relatively low viscosity, which {{may lead to the}} rapid phase separation.|$|R

5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning that she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E
5|$|Dead Money: The first add-on pack was {{released}} for the Xbox 360 on December 21, 2010 and for PlayStation 3 and PC (via Steam) on February 22, 2011. In Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives {{to find the}} fabled treasure of the Sierra Madre Casino, concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, new weapons, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by five. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the four story add-ons that cannot be revisited {{after the completion of}} its main questline.|$|E
