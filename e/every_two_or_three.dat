5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments {{for the rights to}} do such films.|$|E

In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord {{took the first}} place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century.

5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered once <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks, and kept nearly dry {{during the winter}} months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean tropical year, so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of the 21st century, there was only a small, largely elderly {{community}} left in Syria. Jews were still officially banned from politics and government employment, and did not have military service obligations. Jews were also the only minority to have their religion mentioned on their passports and identification cards. Though they were occasionally subjected to violence by Palestinian protesters, the Syrian government took measures to protect them. There was a Jewish primary school for religious studies, and Hebrew was allowed to be taught in some schools. <b>Every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> months, a rabbi from Istanbul visited the community to oversee the preparation of kosher meat, which residents froze and used until his next visit.|$|E

The size required for an enclosure to be exempt from such regulations starts at 2m² (21.5 ft², about the area of a single/twin mattress.) for a small dog and up to 5.5m² (60 ft²) for a large dog. Similar regulations exist in Finland.|$|R

25|$|The Kuvasz's stiff, dense coat, {{growing up}} to 15cm (6 inches) in length, {{does not require}} any special grooming. It needs to be brushed once a week or, better still, <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days. For {{standard}} grooming purposes, use of a grooming rake or a pin-brush with rounded pins is recommended. To remove stubborn knots, use a curry comb or a large-toothed comb. During the spring and autumn the Kuvasz moults (also known as shedding), and he will lose copious amounts of hair very quickly. Frequent brushing is therefore needed to keep his coat tidy. A Kuvasz should not smell or have an odor; such is usually a sign of illness or a poor diet.|$|E
25|$|As {{fighting}} intensified {{along the}} Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force now dispatched its fighter squadrons on regular deployments to the airfield, with four pilots and aircraft rotating <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> weeks. Two aircraft regularly stood on {{quick reaction alert}} (QRA) at the base, ready to scramble within 5 minutes. Many of the kills achieved by Israeli fighter pilots between 1967 and 1973 were claimed by the Rephidim QRA aircraft, and many pilots sought to be stationed there during times of tension, eager to improve their chances of achieving a victory. The base was also the forward recovery base for any aircraft damaged or low on fuel, {{as well as the}} premier medical station for soldiers wounded in the fighting along the Canal, from which they were then ferried to Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Nebra sky disc is a Bronze Age bronze disc {{that was}} buried in Germany, {{not far from the}} Goseck circle, around 1600 BC. It {{measures}} about 30cm diameter with a mass of 2.2kg and displays a blue-green patina (from oxidization) inlaid with gold symbols. Found by archeological thieves in 1999 and recovered in Switzerland in 2002, it was soon recognized as a spectacular discovery, among the most important of the 20th century. Investigations revealed that the object had been in use around 400 years before burial (2000 BC), but that its use had been forgotten by the time of burial. The inlaid gold depicted the full moon, a crescent moon about 4 or 5 days old, and the Pleiades star cluster in a specific arrangement forming the earliest known depiction of celestial phenomena. Twelve lunar months pass in 354 days, requiring a calendar to insert a leap month <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years in order to keep synchronized with the solar year's seasons (making it lunisolar). The earliest known descriptions of this coordination were recorded by the Babylonians in 6th or 7th centuries BC, over one thousand years later. Those descriptions verified ancient knowledge of the Nebra sky disc's celestial depiction as the precise arrangement needed to judge when to insert the intercalary month into a lunisolar calendar, making it an astronomical clock for regulating such a calendar a thousand or more years before any other known method.|$|E
