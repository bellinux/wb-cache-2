25|$|Collecting {{for most}} people is a choice, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>it</b> can be a compulsion, sharing {{characteristics}} with obsessive hoarding. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.|$|E

PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside. However, some research supports that the average time to complete recovery is 6.25 years, and the more severe the case is, the longer recovery period.|$|E
25|$|In Nature, sucrose {{is present}} in many plants, and in {{particular}} their roots, fruits and nectars, because {{it serves as a}} way to store energy, primarily from photosynthesis. Many mammals, birds, insects and bacteria accumulate and feed on the sucrose in plants and <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>it</b> is their main food source. Seen from a human consumption perspective, honeybees are especially important because they accumulate sucrose and produce honey, an important foodstuff all over the world. The carbohydrates in honey itself primarily consists of fructose and glucose with trace amounts of sucrose only.|$|E

25|$|However, {{some species}} of Drosophila are {{difficult}} to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. <b>For</b> <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> {{can be done with}} particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as sterols that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal Drosophila lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The , located at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.|$|E
25|$|The women disembarked in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal. After their arrival, {{their time}} to find husbands varied greatly. <b>For</b> <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> was as short as a few months, while others took {{two or three years}} before finding an {{appropriate}} husband. For the process of choosing a husband, and the marriage, most couples would officially get engaged in church, with their priest and witnesses present. Then, some couples went in front of the notary, to sign a marriage contract. Marriages were celebrated by the priest, usually in the woman’s parish of residence. While the marriage banns customarily were to be published three times before a wedding could take place, the colony’s need for women to marry quickly led to few filles du roi having marriage banns announced. It is known that 737 of these filles du roi were married in New France.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Murrill {{wrote of}} this mushroom's edibility: [...] "Usually viewed with {{suspicion}} {{because of its}} red hymenium, but its properties are not accurately known." [...] Since then, several authors have advised against consuming the species, due to its resemblance to other toxic red-capped boletes. In his 100 Edible Mushrooms (2007), Michael Kuo notes that although the mushroom is apparently edible <b>for</b> <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> [...] "affects others negatively". Despite these warnings, Exsudoporus frostii is edible, and David Arora mentions that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico; a 1997 study {{suggests that it is}} only consumed in rural areas in Querétaro state.

500|$|The {{impact of}} 9/11 extends beyond {{geopolitics}} into {{society and culture}} in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags. The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative or thematic elements in film, television, music and literature. Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns. [...] 9/11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from expert scientists, engineers, and historians. 9/11 has also had {{a major impact on}} the religious faith of many individuals; <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>it</b> strengthened, to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely, because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion.|$|E
500|$|Over 1,000 {{families}} {{lived on}} the site on farms or in the hamlets of Elza, Robertsville, and Scarboro. The first that most heard about the acquisition was when a representative from the ORD visited to inform them that their land was being acquired. Some returned home from work one day to find an eviction notice nailed to their door or to a tree in the yard. Most were given six weeks to leave, but some were given just two. The government took possession of 13 tracts for immediate construction work on 20 November 1942. By May 1943, 742 declarations had been filed covering [...] Most residents were told to prepare to leave between 1 December and 15 January. In cases where this would cause undue hardship, the MED allowed residents to stay beyond this date. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>it</b> was the third time {{that they had been}} evicted by the government, having previously been evicted for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1920s and the TVA's Norris Dam in the 1930s. Many expected that, like the TVA, the Army would provide assistance to help them relocate; but unlike the TVA, the Army had no mission to improve the area or the lot of the local people, and no funds for the purpose. Tires were in short supply in wartime America, and moving vehicles were hard to find. Some residents had to leave behind possessions that they were unable to take with them.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (<b>for</b> <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{statistic}} {{was somewhat}} disputed in a 2006 article about {{poverty in the}} slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, [...] "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically {{because of the fact}} that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>it</b> is because 'it's none of your business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".|$|E
