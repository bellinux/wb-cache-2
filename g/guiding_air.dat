40|$|We propose and numerically {{investigate}} the thermal-insensitive properties of a wavelength-selective filter based on heterostructure photonic crystals with ultralow-refractive-index metallic nanowires. The operational {{principle of the}} proposed device {{is based on the}} photon trapping by total external reflections between the ultralow refractive index metamaterial claddings and the <b>guiding</b> <b>air</b> cores. The low propagation losses, the ultracompact size as well as the temperature-insensitive operation are the main advantages of the proposed metamaterial technology, making the proposed de-multiplexer an excellent candidate for applications in nanophotonic-integrated systems operating in the visible frequency spectrum...|$|E

Temperature control is achieved by mixing with unheated outside air. Air-cooled Volkswagen engines use this method. Depending on the design, this can cause a safety issue where a leak in the exhaust system will begin to fill the passenger cabin with deadly fumes.|$|R
