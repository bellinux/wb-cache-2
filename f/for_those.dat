5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up.

These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group {{failed to show up}} for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners in all. These 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.|$|E

5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option <b>for</b> <b>those</b> assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection <b>for</b> <b>those</b> inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E

The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who retired before 1974 and one <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
