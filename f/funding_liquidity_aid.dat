40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk {{has played}} a key role in all {{historical}} banking crises. Nevertheless, a measure based on publicly available data remains so far elusive. We address this gap by showing that aggressive bidding at central bank auctions reveals <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. We can extract an insurance premium from banks' bids which we propose as measure of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in the main refinancing operation auctions conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes, especially around key events during the recent crisis. We also document downward spirals between <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk and market liquidity. As measurement without clear definitions is impossible, we initially provide definitions of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> and <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity,</b> liquidity risk, bidding behavior, central bank auctions, interbank markets...|$|R

50|$|As the {{possibility}} that over a specific horizon the bank will become unable to settle obligations with immediacy, <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk is another significant definition to describe economic ability. According to IMF, <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk means latent of possible that financial intermediary is unable to repay the liability in expiration of obligation. <b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk relies on the four liquidity sources above. The features of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk and market liquidity risk are similar.

Over the sample period the two variables are uncorrelated most of the time, since shocks to <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> are economically small.

40|$|I {{consider}} banks' role {{in providing}} <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> (the ability to raise cash on demand) and market liquidity (the ability to trade assets at low cost), and how these roles have evolved. Traditional banks made illiquid loans funded with liquid deposits, thus producing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposits are less important in 21 st century banks, but <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> from lines of credit and loan commitments has become more important. Banks also provide market liquidity as broker-dealers and traders in securities and derivatives markets, in loan syndication and sales, and in loan securitization. Many institutions besides banks provide market liquidity in similar ways, but banks dominate in producing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> because of their comparative advantage in managing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. This advantage stems from the structure of bank balance sheets {{as well as their}} access to government-guaranteed deposits and central-bank liquidity. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk {{captures the}} {{inability}} of a financial intermediary to service its liabilities as they fall due. This type of risk is particularly relevant for banks since their business model involves funding long-term loans through short-term deposits and other liabilities. The healthy functioning of interbank lending markets can help reduce <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk because banks can obtain loans in this market quickly and at little cost. When interbank markets are dysfunctional or strained, banks face a greater <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk which in extreme cases can result in insolvency.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} firms manage their <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk by spreading out the maturity of bonds. We find that larger, more leveraged, less profitable, growth-oriented, and non-bank dependent firms exhibit the largest maturity dispersion of outstanding bonds. Such dispersion is maintained by frequently issuing sets of bonds with different maturities. We further find that more bond maturity dispersion results in higher funding availability and lower funding costs. The effects are stronger for firms that face more <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. The evidence suggests that spreading out bond maturities is an effective corporate policy to manage <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} that carry traders {{are subject to}} crash risk: i. e. exchange rate movements between high-interest-rate and low-interest-rate currencies are negatively skewed. We argue that this negative skewness is due to sudden unwinding of carry trades, which tend to occur in periods in which risk appetite and <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> decrease. <b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> measures predict exchange rate movements, and controlling for liquidity helps explain the uncovered interest-rate puzzle. Carry-trade losses reduce future crash risk, but increase the price of crash risk. We also document excess co-movement among currencies with similar interest rate.

40|$|Significant {{deviations}} from covered interest parity were observed during {{the financial crisis}} of 2007 - 2009. This paper finds that before the failure of Lehman Brothers the market-wide <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk was the main determinant of these deviations {{in terms of the}} premiums on swap-implied US dollar interest rates for the euro, British pound, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swiss Franc. This suggests that the deviations {{can be explained by the}} existence and nature of liquidity constraints. After the Lehman default, both counterparty risk and <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk in the European economies were the significant determinants of the positive deviations, while the tightened liquidity condition in the US dollar was the main driving factor of the negative deviations in the Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore markets.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of central banking on <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> from 1815 - 1925. Our study is {{motivated}} by the fact that this period experienced the dismantlement of the Second Bank of the US (1816 - 1836), a quasi-central bank, and the creation of the Federal Reserve (1915 - 1925), a modern lender-of-last resort. We exploit the seasonal nature of early US financial markets to identify the impact of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks on market volatility, stock returns, and market liquidity. US markets were often illiquid and prone to crises in September and October because of financial stress from the harvest. Using the call loan rate (the interest rate at which traders borrowed on margin) as a direct measure of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity,</b> we find that market volatility was much higher and market liquidity significantly lower in September and October than {{during the rest of the}} year. However, there was no such difference during the periods when there were financial institutions such as the Second Bank of the US (1816 - 1836) and the Federal Reserve (1915 - 1925) that could reduce <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk.

40|$|Some {{trends in}} global funding markets are {{leading to a}} new {{paradigm}} about liquidity risk in issuers: increased cross-border debt and equity flows; the growth of equity intermediaries like private funds, sovereign wealth funds, and “club” consortia; {{and the use of}} financial products which embed contingent liabilities in firms, liabilities which “spring” into maturity in market downturns. Working together, national regulators are moving towards an enterprise – rather than entity – view of liquidity risk and making clearer distinctions between market liquidity risk (to assets) and <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk (to obligors). Current surges of commercial liquidity make this a timely issue for issuers (liquidity consumers), prospective investors and creditors (liquidity providers), and national regulators with system responsibilities for financial public goods, like the funding markets. Creative conflicts between the interests of issuers, investor and lenders, and regulators are a healthy part of a financial system, but this paper argues for more financial literacy about <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. After explaining this concept, the paper situates “event risk” in the context of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Recent bondholder losses in leveraged restructurings of firms (“event risk”) have raised questions about whether bond indenture covenants provide adequate protection against the risk of these losses.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{behaviour}} of the CDS-bond basis - {{the difference between}} the CDS and the bond spread - for a sample of investment-graded US firms. I document that, since the onset of the 2007 / 08 financial crisis it has become persistently negative, and I investigate the role played by the cost of trading the basis and its underlying risks. To exploit the negative basis an arbitrageur must finance the purchase of the underlying bond and buy protection. The idea is that, during the crisis, because of the <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> shortage and the increased risk in the financial sector, which exposes protection buyers to counter-party risk, the negative basis trade is risky. In fact, I find that basis dynamics is driven by economic variables that are proxies for <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> (cost of capital and hair cuts), credit markets liquidity and risk in the inter-bank lending market such as the Libor-OIS spread, the VIX, bid-asks spreads and the OIS-T-Bill spread. Results support the evidence that during stress times asset prices depart form frictionless ideals due to <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk faced by financial intermediaries and investors; hence, deviations from parity do not imply presence of arbitrage opportunities.
