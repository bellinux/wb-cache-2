50|$|Later {{renamed the}} 'Penrhos Branch' by the GWR, post-nationalisation it {{came under the}} control of British Railways. On 31 March 1963, a fire {{destroyed}} Tynycaeau Junction signal box and BR decided not to rebuild it, and hence the Penrhos Branch section from the Walnut Tree tunnel southwards to Tynycaeau junction was maintained as its original double track but given 'long siding' status and as Steetley <b>Doloma</b> workings had always necessitated a run-round by the steam locomotive, which could not be performed at the Walnut Tree West rail connection due to the permanent way layout, the loco' had to travel 'light engine' for a round trip of 7¼ miles by running to Tynycaeau and crossing over from down to up line near the former junction with the Cadoxton-Wenvoe-Pontypridd line. With the signal box out of action at Tynycaeau, the crossover was modified to sprung points from down to up line. Eventually even that section was curtailed and sleeper stops placed on both lines at the Walnut Tree tunnel north portal. The double track was not lifted until the decommissioning of the whole line in 1969. The remaining branch was later worked as a single-track long siding from Penrhos to the Steetley <b>Doloma</b> limestone quarry, just south of the viaduct, the permanent way layout having been modified. The last train to the quarry ran over the viaduct in 1967. By the late 1990s the tunnel was gated and by the year 2000 the quarry had breached the tunnel lining, leaving a 50 yd air gap in its structure.|$|E

To figure out the corrosion mechanism due to interfacial reaction with the slag, the slag characteristics were examined in terms of flow temperature and viscosity and the corroded interface of zirconia, magnesia and <b>doloma</b> refractories were analyzed by SEM-EDS and EPMA. With an addition of CaF 2, three different layers were formed at the interface between slag and zirconia refractory. Furthermore, the corrosion of zirconia refractory {{was found to be}} accelerated with an increase of CaF 2 which facilitated the dissolution of intermediate compounds. The penetration of slag through the grain boundaries of MgO refractory is enhanced by increasing the content of CaF 2 due to an increase in the fluidity of slag in the dynamic mode. On the other hand, in the static condition, a dense Ca 2 SiO 4 layer is formed at the hot face of magnesia-doloma refractory due to a reaction between silica in slag and lime in <b>doloma,</b> resulting in the protection of direct corrosion of refractory brick. However, the thickness of C 2 S layer decreases with increasing content of CaF 2 due to an increase in fluidity of slag. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{sintering}} behaviour of dolomite {{extracted from}} a {{mine in the}} Konya-Sille-Ecmel region of Turkey was studied. Sintering tests were performed at different sintering temperatures (1600 °C, 1650 °C and 1700 °C) and soaking times (2, 4, 6 hours) on powders which were either pure or contained selected amounts of iron scale of a thickness below 45 µm (98. 66 wt % Fe 2 O 3). The bulk density and the apparent porosity of the sintered products were examined {{which turned out to}} be dolomite (<b>doloma),</b> and the differences obtained under various sintering conditions were explored. The study revealed the following results: (1) The sintering temperature of the raw dolomite was decreased by the addition of iron oxide, which is attributed to the formation of liquid phase. (2) The newly formed phases were found to sintered granule surfaces very well, resulting in a smaller influenced area and a higher resistance to hydration. Thus, the study has shown that the addition of iron oxide at a level that is small enough to avoid corrosion results in a sintering process that can be carried out at distinctly lower temperatures and in less time. This behaviour may encourage the use of domestic <b>doloma...</b>|$|E

40|$|Low carbon {{ferrochrome}} is {{a primary}} alloying element {{in the production of}} stainless steel. The Mixing Method (Perrin and Duplex) processes are most commonly used for the production thereof. However, during the cocktailing step, process temperatures are extremely high, resulting in rapid deterioration of the ladle refractories and fuming of the products. The high temperature {{is a result of the}} exothermic silicothermic reduction reactions. A significant amount of energy is lost to the atmosphere. The Furnace Method, and in particular the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, has the potential to improve on the shortcomings of the Mixing Method. A techno-economic evaluation was performed on the different process routes to identify whether or not there is merit in choosing one over the other. The evaluation showed that the capital cost for the methods are comparable, but a saving in the operating cost is achievable when using the Furnace Method instead of the Mixing Method. Savings of 7. 3 to 7. 9 % were calculated for the Solid Feed Furnace Method and 9. 6 to 10. 7 % for the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, when compared to the Mixing Method. This is largely due to the lower energy requirement and raw material consumptions for the Furnace Method. The oxidising conditions in the Mixing Method ore-lime melt furnace, combined with a high slag basicity and high operating temperatures, are very conducive for producing hexavalent chromium, which is severely toxic to humans. Leaching tests, performed on a dust sample from an existing facility that uses the Perrin process, confirmed that a significant amount of Cr(VI) was produced. This poses a severe health and safety risk, as well as a financial burden to properly neutralise and dispose of any Cr(VI) that has formed. A closed furnace with little to no air ingress is used in the Furnace Method, thereby ensuring a more neutral atmosphere. A lower basicity slag, with a lower liquidus temperature is also used, thereby further decreasing the amount of Cr(VI) that would be likely to form. Having established that the Furnace Method has definite advantages over the Mixing Method, the preferred refractory-slag system was identified by means of thermochemical modelling. Different combinations of lime and <b>doloma</b> fluxed slag were modelled with magnesia and <b>doloma</b> refractories. Quartz fluxed slag in contact with an alumina lining was also considered to identify any unexpected benefits. The required slag liquidus temperature, to be compatible with low carbon ferrochrome alloy (which has a very high liquidus temperature), was determined to be between 1550 and 1700 ºC. Modelling showed that a quartz fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature well below this range for a very wide basicity range evaluated. Such a slag would therefore not be suitable. While a <b>doloma</b> fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature within this range, the slag basicity for that range would be very low and not be compatible with any of the two basic refractory systems evaluated. <b>Doloma</b> refractories were also found to suffer severe wear at an operating temperature of 1750 ºC, the temperature required to ensure that the alloy is molten. The required basicity range for a lime fluxed slag that had a liquidus temperature between 1550 and 1700 ºC was found to be 1. 68 to 1. 90. The slag only became saturated in MgO above a slag basicity of 1. 99. However, in a commercial-size furnace, the temperature at the refractory hot face would be lower than the process temperature, provided that the slag bath was not excessively turbulent. Sidewall cooling would also assist in maintaining a slag freeze lining. Operating with a slag basicity within the 1. 68 to 1. 90 range should therefore not pose a severe risk. As the process will be operated on a semi-batch basis, the variation of the slag and alloy composition throughout the heat could potentially result in a material that is not compatible with the refractory lining. Two scenarios were modelled, where FeSiCr was added to an ore-lime mixture, and vice versa. The first was found not to be detrimental to the refractories, but there is a concern regarding the high liquidus temperature of the ore-lime melt at the start of the heat. For the second scenario, magnesium was found to report to the gas and alloy phases at the start of the heat. This is of great concern as it would severely damage the refractory lining. To utilise as much of the exothermic energy as possible, while ensuring the integrity of the refractory lining, it was suggested to feed a portion of the ore-lime mixture first, followed by all of the FeSiCr before feeding the remainder of the ore-lime mixture. Feeding crushed, solid FeSiCr allows for better control. However, the latent heat and sensible heat of the FeSiCr would not be utilised. Smelting tests were performed with samples that had slag target basicities of 1. 5 and 2. 0 to investigate the phases that were formed and the severity of the slag-refractory interaction. The composition of the slag with a basicity of 1. 5 corresponded well with that predicted by the thermochemical model, while the slag composition for a target basicity of 2. 0 was very variable. This was due to the high solids content in the slag, which was operated close to its liquidus temperature. The slag CrO content was much lower and the alloy Cr content much higher for both tests, when compared to the values predicted by modelling. The extent to which the reduction reactions occurred was therefore higher than predicted by modelling. The reasons for this would have to be verified by analysing the mechanism by which the reactions occur. The complete dissolution of a refractory disc that was placed in the mixture for the test with a slag target basicity of 1. 5, along with slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible, indicates that the 1. 5 basicity slag was not compatible with the magnesia. This is in agreement with the model. Although the refractory disc was still discernable for the test at a slag target basicity of 2. 0, it was severely worn. Slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible was also evident. A freeze lining would therefore always be required. The Furnace Method can be considered as a suitable alternative to the Mixing Method. However, care should be taken to control the slag basicity in the region of 1. 70 and a freeze lining should be maintained to protect the refractories. The batch feed sequence is also critical to find a balance between having a liquid slag, while still retaining refractory integrity.

40|$|During the {{production}} of steel the oxide inclusion content partly depends on {{the reaction of the}} melt with the furnace lining, the ladle lining and the pouring system. The refractory material may be eroded by the molten steel and slag as well as corroded through chemical reactions with the slag and molten steel and the deoxidation products. In this report the effects of revolution speed, temperature and steel composition on the rate of dissolution of commercial MgO-C refractory samples into Al-deoxidised molten steel and CaOAl 2 O 3 - SiO 2 -MgO slag were examined by the rotating cylinder method. The study also includes tests with slag were <b>doloma</b> refractory samples are examined by the same method. Cylinders of MgO-C refractory material were immersed in to steel that was deoxidised by adding metallic aluminium. This was carried out in the temperature range of 1873 to 1973 C° and at rotational speeds of 100 to 800 rpm for different holding times. The experimental results show that the rate of dissolution of MgO-C refractory materials increased with the temperature, rotational speed and immersion time. This supports the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium through the slag boundary layer formed around the refractory samples would be the rate-determining step. Mass transfer coefficients calculated on the basis of experimental results are in good agreement with earlier published results for pure ceramics. A formation of a thin oxide layer at the interface was found. It is due the reaction between magnesium vapour and the CO generated by the reaction MgO and C in the refractory walls. The oxide inclusions formed in the steel have been shown to mainly consist of MgO, Al 2 O 3 and a mixture of them. The rate of dissolution of solid MgO-C into liquid CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO slag at different temperatures was studied under conditions of forced convection by rotating cylindrical refractory specimens in a stationary crucible containing the molten slag similar to the MgO-C refractory/steel experiments. The corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The rate of corrosion increased with temperature and with rotating speed of the rod and decreased when the slag was nearly saturated with MgO. The experimental results confirm the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium oxide through the slag phase boundary layer controls the corrosion process. The corrosion mechanism seems to be the dissolution of elements in the refractory materials into the slag, followed by penetration into the pores and grain boundaries. Finally, grains are loosened from the refractory into the slag. The investigation of <b>doloma</b> and doloma-carbon showed that the dissolution of magnesia into the slag was determining the corrosion rate. As for the other experiments, steel/MgO-C refractory and slag/MgO-C refractory, the corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The results from the study showed that refractory materials that were impregnated with carbon had a much better slag resistance than the refractory that contained no carbon. This is due to the higher wetting angle between carbon and slag. Corrosion of MgO-C refractories in different gas atmospheres consisting of air, Ar, CO or Ar/CO was also studied. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 1173 K to 1773 K and for holding times between 2 to 120 min. The reaction rate of the MgO-C material was determined from measurements of the weight loss of the samples. The results showed that the refractory weight loss increased with an increased temperature or an increased holding time. The thermodynamic conditions and the experimental results show that magnesium gas and carbon monoxide gas should form during ladle refining of steel when the refractory material consists of MgO-C.
