5000|$|... {{living is}} a sin common to human nature, and appears in men as early, or earlier than any other; and all men are guilty of it, {{at one time or}} another; but all are not habitually liars, as it seems these Cretians were: lying was a {{governing}} vice among them; they were not only guilty of it in some particular instances, but always; not only for saying that Jupiter's sepulchre was with them, when it was the sepulchre of Minos his son, which they had fraudulently obliterated; and for which Callimachus charges them with lying, and uses these very words of Epimenides; though he assigns a different reason from that now given, which is, that Jupiter died not, but always exists, and therefore his sepulchre could not be with them: but this single instance was not sufficient to fasten such a character upon them; it was a sin they were addicted to: some countries are distinguished by their vices; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> pride; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> levity, vanity, and inconstancy; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> boasting and bragging <b>some</b> <b>for</b> covetousness; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> idleness; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> effeminacy; <b>some</b> <b>for</b> hypocrisy and deceit; and others, as the Cretians, it seems, for lying; this was their national sin; and this is said by others, as well as Epimenides.

Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, <b>for</b> <b>some,</b> deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E
