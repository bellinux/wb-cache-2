40|$|This study {{examines}} the way EFL teachers scaffold their {{students in the}} writing instruction and the possible impact of the instruction {{on the quality of}} students’ work. It is a qualitative case study because it focused on a particular situation (classroom setting) and a specific phenomenon (scaffolding instruction in EFL classroom). This research was conducted at two senior high schools in Cimahi and Cisarua employing multiple data collection techniques, particularly classroom observation, interview and students’ text analysis. The {{results of the present study}} have revealed four findings. First, there are eleven types of scaffolding instruction used by the teacher on the stage of GBA. Second, the actualization of the scaffolding instructions was mostly provided in Modeling of Text (MoT) and weakens in Independent construction (JCoT) stage. Third, there seems to be relationship between teachers’ awareness and realization of scaffolding. <b>Finally,</b> <b>most</b> <b>students</b> have shown a significant progress in terms of social function, schematic structures, and linguistic features. These suggest that instructional scaffolding, to some extents, is proven effective in developing the students’ writing capacity of hortatory exposition texts...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an {{experience with the}} Team-Based Learning (TBL) methodology in courses designed to support the planning and execution of final course monographs. It contains both professors’ and students’ perceptions, through observation and assessment. A qualitative approach using observation techniques and desk research was {{used in conjunction with}} a quantitative approach based on a questionnaire. The sample consisted of 49 students from a higher education institution, 27 of them in a Communication Course and the remaining 22 in a Business Administration course. Qualitative data analysis was performed through simple categorization with back-defined categories, while the quantitative data analysis employed descriptive statistics and cluster analysis using Minitab 17. 1 software. The main findings include the identification of: three student profiles (designated as traditional, collaborative and practical); a preference for guidance and feedback from the professor rather than other students; and a need for a professor-led closing discussion when applying the TBL method. As regards the main benefits to students, they recognized that discussion in groups allowed them to realize how much they really know about the subject studied. <b>Finally,</b> <b>most</b> <b>students</b> seemed to like the TBL approach...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the impact of a Tutor Work-Study Programme, within the Digital Academic Literacy Programme (DAL) at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), South Africa. This study was {{prompted}} by the need to investigate the impact of peer (student) tutoring initiatives on tutors’ learning, academic studies and future career preparation. This paper seeks to make a contribution to the broadening of conceptions regarding impact of tutoring programmes from knowledge gains in the recipients, to gains (and impediments) conferred to tutors supporting the delivery of the material. While the enquiry focuses primarily on the DAL tutors, it also includes an account {{of the impact of the}} tutors on the delivery and facilitation of programme, and on the registered UWC students served by it. A mixed-methodology is employed, incorporating qualitative and quantitative data, drawn from questionnaires and interviews. The sample consists the tutors in the programme (second semester, 2014) who agreed to take part in the study, as well as the three facilitators. Data are also drawn from a semester-end evaluation regarding tutoring. Findings reveal that participation in the DAL Programme had a strongly positive impact on the tutors, especially in skills gains and general career preparation. The tutors also had a strongly positive impact on the delivery and the facilitators. <b>Finally,</b> while <b>most</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in the DAL Programme were satisfied with the quality of the support and expertise provided by tutors in class, some areas for improvement are identified. Ultimately, the need to reflect critically on student interventions at Higher Education Institutions must be taken seriously, especially in the context of producing professional, knowledgeable, and employable graduates who are able to meet the demands of the modern information economy. In this context, the results of this research reveal that should the DAL Programme be discontinued or cease to be integrated into the curriculum at UWC, student development would be directly impeded, given the dire need for digital academic literacies.

40|$|A college professor, who {{is highly}} skeptical of change, but sensing {{a need for}} {{teaching}} in a more inspiring and engaging way, implements an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach to teaching the history of mathematics. The first author (Matthews) worked with an experienced IBL colleague mentor (Hodge) on the course. Some student data was collected to document {{the effects of the}} class on the students. The approach taken for the course is described in detail including how the students of the course learned about and used IBL in key peer-to-peer teaching about historical mathematics (with a primary focus on the mathemat- ics). An innovative rubric is described to evaluate IBL teaching. Results indicate that the students were engaged in the course and inspired about mathematics, seemingly more than previous semesters. The results also imply that the stu- dents learned at least as much mathematics and history as in previous semester. <b>Finally,</b> the <b>students,</b> <b>most</b> of which were future high school teachers, began to seriously reflect on their own teaching and appreciated the IBL approach...|$|R
