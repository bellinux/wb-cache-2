5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in land snails of the genus <b>Helix,</b> {{including}} the escargot <b>Helix</b> pomatia, and the common garden snail <b>Helix</b> aspersa (also known as Cornu aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|E

Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to fabricate polymeric <b>helixes</b> with sub-micron dimensions. These <b>helixes</b> are made using a double-templating process, in which an inorg. thin film deposited using glancing angle deposition acts as the master. The shape, pitch, handedness and no. of turns of the polymer <b>helixes</b> can be tuned by altering the deposition parameters of the master film. The structure of this pos. master is copied into a neg. intermediate template of photoresist, which itself acts as a master for the templating of polymer <b>helixes.</b> This process is demonstrated with four multifunctional acrylates. The master, intermediate template and polymer <b>helixes</b> are characterized using SEM, and the polymer <b>helixes</b> are characterized using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. It is shown that a large no. of polymer helical microstructures, which are anchored to both a thick substrate and a thin capping layer, {{can be made in}} parallel over areas of mm 2 to cm 2...|$|R

5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA <b>helix</b> and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA <b>helix</b> and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the <b>helix.</b> Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double <b>helix</b> that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double <b>helix</b> that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E

40|$|The 7 α-helical {{segments}} of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) {{passing through the}} membrane are investigated for a continuous H bonded chain (HBC) 9. The study is carried out by computer modeling approach. It is assumed that the 7 <b>helixes</b> are placed as (AGFEDCB), which has been accepted as the best model by several groups. <b>Helixes</b> A, D, E and G {{are considered to be}} present in right handed α-helical conformation. The inter-orientation of these <b>helixes</b> are represented by Eulerian angles α, β, and γ. For the <b>helixes</b> B, C and F which contain proline in the middle, several conformational possibilities were considered. In these cases apart from the Eulerian angles α, β and γ, the dihedral angles Φp- 1 and Ψp- 1 of the residues that are succeeded by proline residue in the helical regions were also used in fixing the position of the <b>helixes</b> with respect to each other. All these parameters were varied to fit with the top, middle, and bottom distances reported by electron diffraction studies. Good fit was obtained for all right handed α-helical conformations and also for <b>helixes</b> B, C and F with a left handed turn at the residue preceding proline. Hence 2 structures were analyzed for continuous HBC, structure I which contained all the 7 <b>helixes</b> in right handed α-helical conformation and structure II, which had the <b>helixes</b> A, D, E and G in right handed conformation and the <b>helixes</b> B, C and F in right handed α-helical conformation with a left handed turn at the residue preceding proline. All possible staggered conformations were considered for the side chains and the inter at. distances were analyzed for H bonds. It was possible to obtain a continuous chain in both the structures which includes most of the residues found to be important by the expts. However lysine- 216 has to be considered in 2 different conformations to connect the cytoplasmic side with the extra cellular side. The overall height spanned by HBC is about 25. ANG. The chains obtained by both the structures I and II are analyzed in terms of the conformational parameters. It has also been possible to place the retinal in the region as predicted by the expts. The tryptophan residues which affect the spectral characteristics can be aligned {{on either side of the}} retinal...|$|R
5|$|In a DNA double <b>helix,</b> {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double <b>helix</b> is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double <b>helix</b> can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA <b>helix</b> is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Helix</b> has {{traditionally}} been known for offering {{a panoramic view of}} the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new residential building partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the <b>Helix</b> is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E

5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double <b>helix</b> with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double <b>helix</b> must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E

5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor.

5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together.
