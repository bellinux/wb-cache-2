500|$|April 15, 2006, was the 59th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Rachel Robinson {{attended}} the ceremony, having former Negro Leagues players Robert Scott and Armando Vazquez also attending the ceremony. [...] His widow was honored and celebrated at Shea Stadium. After a video tribute on the scoreboard of Shea Stadium of Jackie Robinson, Rachel Robinson {{walked to the}} pitcher's mound before the New York Mets hosted the Milwaukee Brewers, along with Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, and New York Mets manager Willie Randolph. [...] "I've got a picture of Jackie in my office, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> every day," [...] Randolph said. [...] "I'm {{just happy to be}} a part of this day." [...] A large blue, gray and white circle with [...] "42" [...] on it was put over home plate representing the colors of Jackie Robinson's uniform with the Dodgers as a major leaguer.|$|E
500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child {{has the right to}} grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E
6000|$|... "What I think doesn't signify--I {{mean what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> What I {{meant to say}} was that great as is your {{suspense}} about your play, your suspense about your actress is greater still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> {{must ask}} Mr. Wilmington. Jack," [...] she called over her {{shoulder}} {{to the young man}} at the window, [...] "do you think your uncle would approve of me as Juliet's Nurse?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Robert K. Elder for the book The Best Film You've Never Seen, Durkin said, “When I make a film, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things <b>that</b> scare me. My exploration of those things {{is to try and}} wrap my head around them and confront them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I'm {{doing for}} you!" [...] she echoed. [...] "What hurts me most, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, is <b>that</b> I'll {{never be able}} to do anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> When my Esther ventures to judge for herself, these prejudices will give way. She {{shall not be}} disobedient, but you will all {{perceive}} the uselessness of withholding my darling. Meanwhile, I only ask you to let me see her name from time to time. You won't deny me that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{pioneers in}} such matters take {{enormous}} risks {{for the benefit of}} the community, sir. We believe that we are entitled to a franchise, and in my opinion the General Court are behaving disgracefully in refusing us one. I will not say all <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> affair, Mr. Bass. I am convinced that influences are at work--" [...] He broke off with a catch in his throat.|$|E
6000|$|Our form read two authors a term, one Latin and one Greek. It was the Greek that we feared most. Mellish had a sort {{of genius}} for picking out {{absolutely}} untranslatable passages, and desiring us (in print) to render the same with full notes. This term the book had been Thucydides, Book II, with regard to which I may echo the words of a certain critic when called upon to give his candid opinion of a friend's first novel, 'I dare not say what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> book.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{forgotten}} that you're a fire-eater," [...] said Jolly slowly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>about</b> all you are; {{or that you}} called me a pro-Boer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a bit tired, but an hour's {{rest will}} put me all to rights. That's the third fire I've bin called to to-night; not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> much <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{but the last}} one has bin a stiff one, an' I got a fall or two that nigh shook the wind out o' me." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet, {{whether this}} be uglier or prettier than Gainsborough's child--(and you know already what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>that</b> no Greek goddess was ever half so pretty as an English girl, of pure clay and temper,)--uglier or prettier, {{it is more}} dignified and impressive. It at least belongs to the domain of a lordlier, more majestic, more guiding and ordaining art.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps; {{but he is}} {{not like}} his father," [...] {{returned}} Chingatok meekly. [...] "There are two other chiefs among the Kablunets who seem to me fine men. They are very young and wise. They have learned a little of our tongue from the Brainless One, and asked me some questions about the rocks, and the moss, and the flowers. They are tall and strong. One of them is very grave and seems to think much, like myself. He also spoke of this Nothing--this Nort Pole. They are all mad, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> thing-- that Nothing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{accuse me}} of restlessness? Shall I explain what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> I'm restless because of ambition; I want to reconquer an {{independent}} position. I put all my soul into my trials, {{but as soon as}} I see there's no future for me in that line, I give it up and go elsewhere. 'Je ne veux pas etre rond de cuir,' breaking my back to economise sixpence a day, and save enough after forty years to drag out the remains of an exhausted existence. That's not in my character." [...] This ingenious paraphrase of the words [...] "I soon get tired of things" [...] he pronounced with an air of letting Shelton into a precious secret.|$|E
5000|$|In all, {{the group}} toured the US {{three times and}} went to Alaska, Australia and Hawaii twice. [...] "It's tiring," [...] DeLonge told Thrasher in November 1996. [...] "Then again, I just {{remember}} I {{used to work at}} this stupid job. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and I realize I'm not that bad off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fudge, Ethel! Not to-day. Do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> care <b>about</b> <b>that</b> boy? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> not! But--but--I {{wanted to}} think him a nasty prig, but I can't!' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Just as a guess, <b>I</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 40% of our {{patients}} could be handled without hospitalization if anybody {{made an effort to}} do so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carr {{was born}} to William Raymond and Helen Marie Brown as {{one-half}} Cherokee and one-half French and was the oldest of six children. She was raised on a small farm in Asbury, Missouri, outside Joplin, Missouri {{and according to the}} actress, grew up in a poor family, saying: [...] "We were poor, but so was everybody else, so <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{speaking}} {{on death row}} and before the Board of Pardons and Paroles, Dennis contended that his victim shared responsibility for his death {{because he did not}} cooperate with Dennis's demands. [...] "I ain't saying it's all his fault, but why did he move?" [...] Dennis said from death row. [...] "Every day <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It ain't 'Why did you kill that man?' It's 'Why did you move?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, {{and raised}} by a single mother, James was {{influenced}} by an eclectic array of music, particularly jazz and R&B. James said his love for music started when he watched a contestant perform a cover version of [...] "A Song for You" [...] on Showtime at the Apollo. He said [...] "I got chills. And I get that feeling all over again whenever <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> performance. At the time, I'd never said I {{wanted to be a}} singer; I just knew I wanted to entertain. And I'd never heard of Donny. But when my mother found her copy of one of his records, I knew then that I wanted to reach people that way." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2013, Guru-Murthy interviewed Quentin Tarantino, who was {{promoting}} his new film, Django Unchained. When he asked Tarantino {{to consider whether}} there is a link between film violence and real-life atrocities in America, especially {{in the wake of the}} Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Tarantino stated that his opinion on the matter was well-documented and then responded, [...] "I refuse your question. I'm not your slave and you're not my master. You can't make me dance to your tune. I'm not a monkey." [...] When Guru-Murthy tried to steer the conversation back towards the subject later in the interview, Tarantino continued, [...] "It's none of your damn business what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> … And I'm shutting your butt down." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reflecting on White Ladders {{success in}} 2010, Gray stated: [...] "I still pinch myself when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> record {{will be there}} for ever. It just {{connected}} in such a big way with people. ... It was the period that came after that was difficult. ... I'm sort of seen as a pop artist. I'm dismissed as slight, I'd say, because of White Ladder." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ron Santo {{told reporters}} that [...] "When he {{mentioned}} {{the fact that he}} was going to walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise money for diabetes, I couldn't believe it! Then, when I heard he was 20 miles away, I'm saying 'get in the car and drive it. You've made it!' But he said, 'Nope, I'm going to walk'. <b>I</b> mean, <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It's Amazing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is so hard}} {{to write}} things, Mr. Tavernake," [...] she said, [...] "but, of course, it is {{something}} to know that if the worst happens I can send her a letter. <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> for a short time. Meanwhile, there is so much about her I would love to have you tell me. She has no money, has she? How does she support herself?" ...|$|R

5000|$|The song debuted and {{peaked at}} number four on the UK Singles Chart, selling 77,000 copies {{in its first}} week. It became the first of Lopez's 17 top ten hits in that country. By 2016, it had sold 366,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

It also topped the charts in New Zealand, Canada, Netherlands and Finland. In France, it was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique for shipments of 100,000 units. It was also certified gold in Germany, Switzerland and New Zealand. Reflecting on the song's success in 2011, Lopez said, [...] "Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and still it's like wow, my first record I ever did went to number one. It's just an overwhelming feeling. This does not happen all the time. This {{is a very special}} thing." ...|$|E

60|$|I liked Cynthia, and I {{was sorry}} for her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time <b>I</b> met her, I {{was sorry for}} most people. The shock of Audrey's {{departure}} had had that effect upon me. It is always the bad nigger who gets religion most strongly at the camp-meeting, and in my case 'getting religion' had taken the form of suppression of self. I never {{have been able to}} do things by halves, or even with a decent moderation. As an egoist I had been thorough in my egoism; and now, fate having bludgeoned that vice out of me, I found myself possessed of an almost morbid sympathy with the troubles of other people.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna explained the tour's title. She stated, [...] "I like to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> myself as 'The Last Girl on Earth' because sometimes people {{make decisions based on}} the outlook of others and, you know, to me, my life is my life. It's my world, and I'm going to live it the way I want to. <b>That's</b> how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> everything, <b>that</b> way I'm focused on me, and my work. It's a really narrow space, a focus." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If You Had My Love" [...] (Lopez' debut single) was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from On the 6 on May 4, 1999. Produced by Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Fred Jenkins III and Cory Rooney, the single was an instant hit (reaching {{number one in the}} United States). It was also an international success, reaching number one in Australia, New Zealand, Finland and other countries; it reached the top ten in over ten countries. Reflecting on the song's success in the United States, Lopez said [...] "Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and still it's like wow, my first record I ever did went to No. 1. It's just an overwhelming feeling... This is a very special thing." [...] A music video for the song, directed by Paul Hunter, caused a stir for its theme of voyeurism and became a fixture on the music video channel MTV. It was well received by critics, with Entertainment Weekly grading it A-minus. [...] "No Me Ames" [...] (with Marc Anthony) was the album's second single. Although it {{was released}} as a B-side single to [...] "If You Had My Love", both songs were provided to radio stations and it charted on Billboards Hot Latin Songs chart.|$|E
5000|$|... "All of the ballplayers in {{the movie}} were prepped for the film by Rod Dedeaux. He coached at USC for many years, and is a {{wonderful}} man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you -- were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' said 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, {{and that was the}} end of his career.And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're Doc Graham.' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do you ever think about, [...] "gee, the career I might've had."' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do -- the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion -- which could have gone into bitterness or regret -- into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, I think, anybody else in college history. He's an amazing man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can fellows like {{ourselves}}, {{who know}} what life and death really mean, dare {{to make a joke}} of anything? I know we pretend it, to save ourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme. Can't I see, old man, how you're always anxious about me, and try to advise me to make my work better? Do you suppose <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> myself? But you can't help me--you can't help me--not even you. I must play my own hand alone in my own way.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Speaking of the album's {{sound and}} lyricism, Lopez stated, [...] "It's gonna be a {{different}} sound, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a lot {{has happened to me}} in the past year or two, I've changed a little bit, my ideas about love has changed...you grow", referring to her divorce from singer Marc Anthony, which inspired lyrics for the album. However, she maintained that her topic is still love, [...] "It's my motivation. It's what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> <b>That's</b> who <b>I</b> am at the essence." [...] Speaking further about the album's concept, she said [...] "if you listen to my albums, they were always about love. I've always sung about love. It was always love in a certain way: A fairytale type of way; I was hoping, praying, and wishing for that." [...] Describing her approach for this album, Lopez stated that [...] "there was just a lot that I had to say", claiming: [...] "My goal was to just be as honest as I could. You know, I'd gone through a lot in my life right at that point when I went on tour. I'd been through a divorce. A lot of things had happened. I really felt like it was a turning point in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] {{said the}} young lord, [...] "you {{know very well}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> all <b>that.</b> A fellow is not any better to me because he has got a title, nor yet because he owns half a county. But men have their ideas and {{feelings}} about it. My father is a rich man, and of course he'll want his daughter to marry a rich man. My father is noble, and he'll want his daughter to marry a nobleman. You can't very well marry Mary without his permission, and therefore you had better let it alone." ...|$|R
