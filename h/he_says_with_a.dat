60|$|It was {{perfectly}} delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty became inspired {{when he thought}} of his little favourite. He stands before me again, his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and pride, for which I can find no description. His honest eyes fire up, and sparkle, as if their depths were stirred by something bright. His broad chest heaves with pleasure. His strong loose hands clench themselves, in his earnestness; and he emphasizes what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right arm that shows, in my pigmy view, like a sledge-hammer.|$|E
6000|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of priggishness, which he dreads with some reason, he {{even went so far}} as to procure a herb tobacco, which he smokes with the help of frequent sulphur matches. This he recommends to us strongly. [...] "Won't you try it?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winning smile. [...] "Just once." [...] And he is the only man I ever met who drinks that facetious fluid, non-alcoholic beer. Once he proposed to wean me upon that from my distinctive vice, which led indeed to our first rupture. [...] "I find it delicious," [...] he said in pathetic surprise.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{very easy}} and very natural to turn from this ruffian, shocked by the {{hardened}} retort; but answer his question, why should it? Should he be frightened {{by the sight of}} a dead man? We are born to die, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> careless triumph. We are not born to the treadmill, or to servitude and slavery, or to banishment; but the executioner has done no more for that criminal than nature may do tomorrow for the judge, and will certainly do, in her own good time, for judge and jury, counsel and witnesses, turnkeys, hangman, and all. Should he be frightened by the manner of the death? It is horrible, truly, so horrible, that the law, afraid or ashamed of its own deed, hides the face of the struggling wretch it slays; but does this fact naturally awaken in such a man, terror--or defiance? Let the same man speak. [...] "What did you think then?" [...] asked Mr. Wakefield. [...] "Think? Why, I thought it was a--shame." ...|$|E
60|$|In this matter, as in {{all such}} matters, we lose our {{bearings}} entirely by speaking of the 'lower classes' when we mean humanity minus ourselves. This trivial romantic literature is not especially plebeian: it is simply human. The philanthropist can never forget classes and callings. <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> modest swagger, 'I have invited twenty-five factory hands to tea.' If he said 'I have invited twenty-five chartered accountants to tea,' everyone would see the humour of so simple a classification. But {{this is what we}} have done with this lumberland of foolish writing: we have probed, as if it were some monstrous new disease, what is, in fact, nothing but the foolish and valiant heart of man. Ordinary men will always be sentimentalists: for a sentimentalist is simply a man who has feelings and does not trouble to invent a new way of expressing them. These common and current publications have nothing essentially evil about them. They express the sanguine and heroic truisms on which civilization is built; for it is clear that unless civilization is built on truisms, it is not built at all. Clearly, there could be no safety for a society in which the remark by the Chief Justice that murder was wrong was regarded as an original and dazzling epigram.|$|E
6000|$|... '"We {{were passing}} {{to the north}} of the Hector Bank that voyage. I said, 'All right, sir,' {{wondering}} what he was fussing about, since I had to call him before altering the course anyhow. Just then eight bells were struck: we came out on the bridge, and the second mate before going off mentions in the usual way--'Seventy-one on the log.' Captain Brierly looks at the compass and then all round. It was dark and clear, and all the stars were out as plain as on a frosty night in high latitudes. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of a little sigh: 'I am going aft, and shall set the log at zero for you myself, so that there can be no mistake. Thirty-two miles more on this course and then you are safe. Let's see--the correction on the log is six per cent. additive; say, then, thirty by the dial to run, and you may come twenty degrees to starboard at once. No use losing any distance--is there?' I had never heard him talk so much at a stretch, and to no purpose as it seemed to me. I said nothing. He went down the ladder, and the dog, that was always at his heels whenever he moved, night or day, followed, sliding nose first, after him. I heard his boot-heels tap, tap on the after-deck, then he stopped and spoke to the dog--'Go back, Rover. On the bridge, boy! Go on--get.' Then he calls out to me from the dark, 'Shut that dog up in the chart-room, Mr. Jones--will you?' ...|$|E

6000|$|Nothing more strangely {{indicates}} an enormous and silent evil of modern society than the extraordinary use {{which is made}} nowadays of the word [...] "orthodox." [...] In former days the heretic was proud of not being a heretic. It was the kingdoms {{of the world and}} the police and the judges who were heretics. He was orthodox. He had no pride in having rebelled against them; they had rebelled against him. The armies with their cruel security, the kings with their cold faces, the decorous processes of State, the reasonable processes of law--all these like sheep had gone astray. The man was proud of being orthodox, was proud of being right. If he stood alone in a howling wilderness he was more than a man; he was a church. He was the centre of the universe; it was round him that the stars swung. All the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical. But a few modern phrases have made him boast of it. <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conscious laugh, [...] "I suppose I am very heretical," [...] and looks round for applause. The word [...] "heresy" [...] not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means being clear-headed and courageous. The word [...] "orthodoxy" [...] not only no longer means being right; it practically means being wrong. All this can mean one thing, and one thing only. It means that people care less for whether they are philosophically right. For obviously a man ought to confess himself crazy before he confesses himself heretical. The Bohemian, with a red tie, ought to pique himself on his orthodoxy. The dynamiter, laying a bomb, ought to feel that, whatever else he is, at least he is orthodox.|$|E
6000|$|Little Baroski is {{the author}} of the opera of [...] "Eliogabalo," [...] of the oratorio of [...] "Purgatorio," [...] which made such an immense sensation, of songs and ballet-musics innumerable. He is a German by birth, and shows such an {{outrageous}} partiality for pork and sausages, and attends at church so constantly, that I am sure there cannot be any foundation in the story that he is a member of the ancient religion. He is a fat little man, with a hooked nose and jetty whiskers, and coal-black shining eyes, and plenty of rings and jewels on his fingers and about his person, and a very considerable portion of his shirtsleeves turned over his coat to take the air. His great hands (which can sprawl over half a piano, and produce those effects on the instrument for which he is celebrated) are encased in lemon-coloured kids, new, or cleaned daily. Parenthetically, let us ask why so many men, with coarse red wrists and big hands, persist in the white kid glove and wristband system? Baroski's gloves alone must cost him a little fortune; only <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> leer, when asked the question, [...] "Get along vid you; don't you know dere is a gloveress that lets me have dem very sheap?" [...] He rides in the Park; has splendid lodgings in Dover Street; and is a member of the [...] "Regent Club," [...] where he is a great source of amusement to the members, to whom he tells astonishing stories of his successes with the ladies, and for whom he has always play and opera tickets in store. His eye glistens and his little heart beats when a lord speaks to him; and he has been known to spend large sums of money in giving treats to young sprigs of fashion at Richmond and elsewhere. [...] "In my bolyticks," [...] he says, [...] "I am consarevatiff to de bag-bone." [...] In fine, he is a puppy, and withal a man of considerable genius in his profession.|$|E

[...] But {{the ill-fated}} prince only {{gives him a}} warning look and plunges into the mazes of the forest. For a long time silence reigns over the Den. Lights glint fitfully, a human voice imitates the plaintive cry of the peewit, {{cautious}} whistling follows, comes next the clash of arms, and the scream of one in the death-throes, and again silence falls. Stroke emerges near the Reekie Broth Pot, wiping his sword and muttering, [...] "Faugh! it drippeth!" [...] At the same moment the air is filled with music of more than mortal--well, the air is filled with music. It seems to come from but a few yards away, and pressing {{his hand to his}} throbbing brow the Chevalier presses forward till, pushing aside the branches of a fallen fir, he comes suddenly upon a scene of such romantic beauty that he stands rooted to the ground. Before him, softly lit by a half-moon (the man in it perspiring with curiosity), is a miniature dell, behind which rise threatening rocks, overgrown here and there by grass, heath, and bracken, while in the centre of the dell is a bubbling spring called the Cuttle Well, whose water, as it overflows a natural basin, soaks into the surrounding ground and so finds a way into the picturesque stream below. But it is not the loveliness of the spot which fascinates the prince; rather is it the exquisite creature who sits by the bubbling spring, a reed from a hand-loom in her hands, from which she strikes mournful sounds, the while she raises her voice in song. A pink scarf and a blue ribbon are crossed upon her breast, her dark tresses kiss her lovely neck, and as she sits on the only dry stone, her face raised as if in wrapt communion with the heavens, and her feet tucked beneath her to avoid the mud, she seems not a human being, but the very spirit of the place and hour. The royal wanderer remains spellbound, while she strikes her lyre and sings (with but one trivial alteration) the song of MacMurrough:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{frequently}} {{made use}} of the expression [...] "in the three kingdoms," [...] which sometimes preceded a statement that his grandmother was descended from Richard III., while his grandfather {{came down from the}} Cornish giants, one of whom, <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disparaging smile, had once thrown a cow over a wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seymour," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} answered in his board-room style, [...] "you {{are a great}} deal too previous, as Medhurst used to say--I mean, Colonel Clay in his character as Medhurst. In the first place, these are early days; our friends have not yet developed their intentions. We may find before long they have a property to sell, or a company to promote, or a concession to exploit in South Africa or elsewhere. Then again, in the second place, we don't always spot {{the exact nature of}} their plan until it has burst in our hands, so to speak, and revealed its true character. What could have seemed more transparent than Medhurst, the detective, till he ran away with our notes in the very moment of triumph? What more innocent than White Heather and the little curate, till they landed us with a couple of Amelia's own gems as a splendid bargain? I will not take it for granted any man is not Colonel Clay, merely because I don't happen to spot the particular scheme he is trying to work against me. The rogue has so many schemes, and some of them so well concealed, that up to the moment of the actual explosion you fail to detect the presence of moral dynamite. Therefore, I shall proceed as if there were dynamite everywhere. But in the third place--and this is very important--you mark my words, I believe I detect already the lines he will work upon. He's a geologist, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> taste for minerals. Very good. You see if he doesn't try to persuade me before long he has found a coal mine, whose locality he will disclose for a trifling consideration; or else he will salt the Long Mountain with emeralds, and claim a big share for helping to discover them; or else he will try something in the mineralogical line to do me somehow. I see it in the very transparency of the fellow's face; and I'm determined this time neither to pay him one farthing on any pretext, nor to let him escape me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had about}} him, he says, a trusty plaid; {{an old and}} valued {{travelling}} companion and comforter; upon which the rains had descended, and the snows and winds beaten, without further effect than somewhat to tarnish its primitive lustre. This coat of many colors had excited the admiration, and inflamed the covetousness of both warriors and squaws, to an extravagant degree. An idea now occurred to Captain Bonneville, to convert this rainbow garment into the savory viands so much desired. There was a momentary struggle in his mind, between old associations and projected indulgence; and his decision {{in favor of the}} latter was made, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater promptness, perhaps, than true taste and sentiment might have required. In a few moments, his plaid cloak was cut into numerous strips. [...] "Of these," [...] continues he, [...] "with the newly developed talent of a man-milliner, I speedily constructed turbans a la Turque, and fanciful head-gears of divers conformations. These, judiciously distributed among such of the womenkind as seemed of most consequence and interest {{in the eyes of the}} patres conscripti, brought us, in a little while, abundance of dried salmon and deers' hearts; on which we made a sumptuous supper. Another, and a more satisfactory smoke, succeeded this repast, and sweet slumbers answering the peaceful invocation of our pipes, wrapped us in that delicious rest, which is only won by toil and travail." [...] As to Captain Bonneville, he slept in the lodge of the venerable patriarch, who had evidently conceived a most disinterested affection for him; as was shown on the following morning. The travellers, invigorated by a good supper, and [...] "fresh from the bath of repose," [...] were about to resume their journey, when this affectionate old chief took the captain aside, to let him know how much he loved him. As a proof of his regard, he had determined to give him a fine horse, which would go further than words, and put his good will beyond all question. So saying, he made a signal, and forthwith a beautiful young horse, of a brown color, was led, prancing and snorting, to the place. Captain Bonneville was suitably affected by this mark of friendship; but his experience in what is proverbially called [...] "Indian giving," [...] made him aware that a parting pledge was necessary on his own part, to prove that his friendship was reciprocated. He accordingly placed a handsome rifle in the hands of the venerable chief, whose benevolent heart was evidently touched and gratified by this outward and visible sign of amity.|$|E
6000|$|Even more {{important}} than the exposition of human knowledge was the exposition of the degrees by which it had been slowly reared. The Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopædia, of which by far the greater and more valuable portion was written by D'Alembert, contains a fine survey of the progress of science, thought, and letters since the revival of learning. It is a generous canonisation of the great heroes of secular knowledge. It is rapid, but the contributions of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, Locke, Leibnitz are thrown into a series that penetrates the reader's mind with the idea of ordered growth and measured progress. This excited a vivid hopefulness of interest, which insensibly but most effectually pressed the sterile propositions of dogmatic theology into a dim and squalid background. Nor was this all. The Preliminary Discourse and the host of articles marshalled behind it, showed that the triumphs of knowledge and true opinion had all been gained on two conditions. The first of these conditions was a firm disregard of authority; the second was an abstention from the premature concoction of system. The reign of ignorance and prejudice was made inveterate by deference to tradition: the reign of truth was hindered by the artificial boundary-marks set mischievously deep by the authors of systems. As the whole spirit of theology is both essentially authoritative and essentially systematic, this disparagement was full of tolerably direct significance. It told in another way. The Sorbonne, the universities, the doctors, had identified orthodoxy with Cartesianism. [...] "It is hard to believe," [...] says D'Alembert in 1750, [...] "that it is only within the last thirty years that people have even begun to renounce Cartesianism." [...] He might have added {{that one of the most}} powerful of his contemporaries, Montesquieu himself, remained a rigid Cartesian to the end of his days. [...] "Our nation," [...] he says, [...] "singularly eager as it is for novelties in all matters of taste, is in matters of science extremely attached to old opinions." [...] This remark remains true of France to the present hour, and it would be an interesting digression, did time allow, to consider its significance. France can at all events count one master innovator, the founder of Cartesianism himself. D'Alembert points out that the disciples violate the first maxims of their chief. He describes the hypothesis of vortices and the doctrine of innate ideas as no longer tenable, and even as ridiculous; but do not let us forget, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fine movement of candour, that it was Descartes who opened the way; he who set an example to men of intelligence, of shaking off the yoke of scholasticism, of opinion, of authority--in a word, of prejudices and barbarism. Those who remain faithful to his hypothetical system, while they abandon his method, may be the last of his partisans, but they would assuredly never have been the first of his disciples.|$|E
6000|$|The decisive cabinet was on Saturday, April 16. It {{was finally}} settled {{that the budget}} should be {{proposed}} as it stood, with its essential features unaltered.

But at the time he had no eyes for any but those two, who of late had so haunted his thoughts. The sight of either of them would have been sufficiently disconcerting. The sight of both together very nearly made him forget the purpose for which he had come upon the stage.
