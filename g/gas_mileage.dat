30|$|While Uber and Airbnb are {{becoming}} masters in leveraging big data analytics and convincing {{people that they}} know best how to improve efficiency and safety with this data [39], these firms control the narrative and only release figures that favorably portray them. Uber reported that its drivers could earn an average salary of $ 90 [*]k/year, but did not mention that this figure {{was based on the}} salaries of drivers in New York City, which has the highest wages of any city it operates in. Additionally, the fine print shows that this figure applies only to drivers driving over 40 [*]h per week and does not include expenses (<b>mileage,</b> <b>gas,</b> repairs, insurance, etc.). Airbnb similarly released a press release claiming that “quantitative evidence shows hosts are good for NY.” It reported that Airbnb supported 950 jobs in the outer boroughs and 82 % of its properties are outside of mid-Manhattan [39]. However, when the New York Attorney General’s office examined the data, it was found that 97 % of Uber’s revenue came from just two of the five boroughs (Brooklyn and Manhattan) [39]. The claims are delivered in a confident tone with impressive figures but are misleading at best.|$|R
25|$|The {{energy policy}} of the United States is {{determined}} by federal, state, and local entities in the United States, which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> standards. Energy policy may include legislation, international treaties, subsidies and incentives to investment, guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy techniques.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the second}} {{generation}} Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002-05 model years, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a CS-M / CS-QM special edition (based on the CS-D) in either an all-white or an all-red paint scheme with a black-and-red {{interior}} (¥633,000 / ¥673,000). The CS-G was aimed at a more masculine clientele, {{and was the first}} SS40 Cervo to use male models in the advertising. The CS-F had a very high 5th gear and offered a 5% <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> improvement over other Cervos.|$|E
25|$|When introduced, only a CS (4MT) or CS-Q (2AT) {{were offered}} (¥580,000/620,000). In late September the more upscale CS-L (5MT) and CS-QL (2AT) {{were added to}} the lineup, {{offering}} (partially) fabric covered seats {{and a number of other}} conveniences at a starting price of ¥687,000. All had 10-inch steel wheels. The automatic transmission was never too popular, offering only two gear ratios and considerably worse acceleration and <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> (down 20 percent), along with a higher price.|$|E
25|$|All these {{criteria}} would be managed through the home owner's personal computer with internet connection, programming the various devices around {{the home to}} consume electricity only when the management software approves of the consumption. The savings represented by this technique, and enabled by event-driven SOA, is like improving the <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> in your vehicle. It makes your home energy use more efficient by enabling the consumption of electricity when the real-time prices are lower and inhibiting the consumption of electricity when real-time prices are higher.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 {{increases}} average <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> to 35 mpg by 2020.

Toyota {{has suggested that}} their third-generation 2009 Prius may cost {{much less than the}} current model. Larger advanced-technology batteries have been suggested to make it plug-in rechargeable. Photovoltaics are an option being discussed to extend its daytime electric driving range. Improving solar cell efficiency factors will continue to make this a progressively more-cost-effective option.|$|E
25|$|The {{range was}} {{available}} with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving <b>gas</b> <b>mileage.</b> The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the face}} of the new {{competition}} from much larger automakers, the compact Rambler American enjoyed appeal not only because of its low initial price, economy, and high <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> but also because its resale values ranked among the highest. The suggested delivered price for the Deluxe 2-door sedan was $1,795, and it was advertised as the lowest priced car in America. Demand for the traditional American continued to grow as sales increased to 120,603 units (of which 44,817 were two-door sedans, 46,973 four-door sedans, and 28,813 station wagons), thus helping AMC reach 7.5 percent of the U.S. market with a total Rambler sales of 485,745 automobiles and third place among domestic brands.|$|E
25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we {{increase the number}} of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (Kitchen sink regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E
500|$|Hurd {{describes}} additional {{steps taken}} {{to increase efficiency}} and cut production costs: [...] "If you use vehicles that get better <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> that are electric or hybrids, you're {{going to pay a}} lot less in fuel. If you use compact fluorescent bulbs, you're going to save {{a lot of money in}} utilities. If you recycle even your own sets, and use them again, that's going to save money. You don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely." [...] Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
500|$|On Vashon Island, Amondson {{provided}} low rent {{housing for}} people with low income. He appeared in court a few times for zoning difficulties relating to the housing complexes but received legal aid from the Interfaith Council on Homelessness. Amondson was known to drive around Vashon Island in a Honda Civic accessorized with a fake elk head {{on the front and}} a license plate that read [...] "Vote Dry." [...] The car was also decorated with homemade bumper stickers that read [...] "Dumb People Drink" [...] and [...] "Your Kids Need You Sober." [...] While driving past taverns, he regularly honked the car horn twice in protest. In 2008, the car was installed with a hydrogen conversion kit that allowed it to be fueled by gasoline and water using electrolysis, significantly improving <b>gas</b> <b>mileage.</b> Amondson's car {{was one of the first}} in the nation to be fitted with such a kit.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, the Cervo {{received}} {{its most recent}} upgrade. The T model was discontinued, the TX received the [...] "aero" [...] front dam of the SR while the <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> of the G version was improved to meet the 15% <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> improvement goals for Japanese fiscal year 2010. The very efficient SR is the only turbocharged Kei car {{to qualify for the}} lower tax grades for especially environmentally friendly vehicles, combining this with being the most powerful version. The Cervo was discontinued by Suzuki during March 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Sprint" [...] and [...] "Sprint Metro" [...] {{differed}} in their engines, though both were computer controlled carb systems. From 1985 to 1988, the carbureted 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine used a hemispherical head design. Later, fuel injection required the cylinder head for 1989 be redesigned {{to add the}} additional cooling required, reducing <b>gas</b> <b>mileage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} rising {{gasoline}} prices, the Gremlin offers a relatively economical alternative to muscle {{cars and the}} more massive American cars of its era-especially for buyers leaning toward the eccentric. AMC said the Gremlin got [...] "the best <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> of any production car made in America", and its [...] gas tank allowed [...] or more between fill-ups.|$|E
2500|$|The ultra-high <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> car ECST Super Eagle won the American Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) 2004 mileage {{competition}} with a tested fuel consumption of [...] per gallon.

2500|$|The new Grand Cherokee SRT8, {{which started}} {{production}} on July 16, 2011, {{is equipped with}} a [...] 6.4L Hemi V8 engine. Jeep claims the new SRT8 gets 13percent better fuel economy than its predecessor. To keep the <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> respectable, Jeep has employed a new active exhaust system that lets Chrysler's cylinder-deactivating Fuel Saver Technology operate over a wider rpm band. Chrysler claims that with the larger gas tank, the SUV can now travel up to [...] on a single tank, while other sources estimate range to be [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to vans and convertibles, {{there was also}} an [...] "R Manhattan Roof" [...] version with a 10cm taller roof. A [...] "R Manhattan Sound" [...] version incorporated high-quality stereo equipment (including the [...] "Bodysonic", transmitting sound vibrations through the seat). The E-series (E, E 1, E II & EIII; [...] "E" [...] for economy) used higher geared transmissions and trip computers to increase <b>gas</b> <b>mileage.</b> The E III, in {{addition to}} benefitting from the FRM conrods, also had an electronically variable lean-burn engine. First generation production ended in late 1986 with the introduction of the GA type City.|$|E
2500|$|The Gremlin {{debuted in}} April 1970 with AMC's [...] I6, a seven main bearing design which {{produced}} [...] as standard equipment, with AMC's [...] I6 - producing [...] - as an option. AMC said the Gremlin offered [...] "the best <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> of any production car made in America". According to the auto editors of Consumer Guide it had [...] "an unusually long option {{list for the}} era" [...] so owners could have luxury and conveniences typically found in more expensive cars, and these options [...] "came with a much higher profit margin" [...] for the automaker.|$|E
2500|$|The Gremlin's {{body was}} heavier and {{stronger}} than its domestic or imported rivals. The engines were also {{more powerful than the}} Gremlin's main domestic and imported competition. The powertrains were smoother and more reliable, and the car had fewer recalls. Its chief import rival was the Volkswagen Beetle, which did not handle as well, got similar <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> from about 40% of the Gremlin's horsepower. The same overall size as the Gremlin, it was packaged marginally better. Gremlin designer Richard Teague commented in Motor Trend that to compare the Beetle (whose basic design originated in the late 1930s) to the Gremlin in profile and body design was like [...] "comparing a Ford GT40 to the Hindenburg".|$|E
2500|$|YugoCars, Inc. had {{intended}} to fit their YUGO 45 with the 903cc four (45 HP) with a ZEUNA catalytic converter and Lambda feedback - planned <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> was 42 to 45 MPG at 70mph, the emission system was largely {{identical to the one}} used on the Fiat/Bertone X1/9 since the 1980 model year. In late 1983, Zastava had added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine (55 HP) with air-injection and a fuel economy in the 30MPG range. Thus equipped, it was faster and more able to keep up on U.S. freeways, but even so, with an [...] top speed, it was the slowest car sold in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{like the}} 2011 V6 and GT Mustangs, the 2011 Shelby GT500 got an engine update with an all-new 5.4L {{aluminum}} engine which was 102 pounds {{lighter than the}} previous cast-iron engine and uses Ford-patented plasma-coating technology (Plasma transferred wire arc). The inventors of PTWA received the 2009 IPO National Inventor of the Year award. This technology was initially patented and developed by inventors from Flame-Spray. The technology was subsequently improved upon by Ford and Flamespray. With the engine updates, not only has performance improved to [...] and [...] of torque, but the GT500's <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> has improved to [...] city and [...] highway, which was enough to eliminate the U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax. The final production number of the 2011 Shelby GT500 {{by the end of}} the year was 5100 units.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{minor changes}} and {{revisions}} marked the 1984 Grand Prix, including {{the return of}} the octagonal Pontiac hood ornament (which originally debuted in 1976), gauges with orange needles and red markings (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prix gauges had white needles), a T-shaped console shifter, an updated bucket seat design, as well as a woodgrain plate above the glove box (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prixs used a black plate). A new optional four spoke steering wheel was also available. The base and Brougham models continued as before but the LJ was replaced by a new LE model. Same engines continued as before including the Buick [...] V6, Chevy [...] V8 and Olds [...] Diesel V8≈. A new option this year was the Turbo Hydra-Matic 200-4R four-speed overdrive automatic available with the 305 V8 for improved highway <b>gas</b> <b>mileage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unwilling to {{face the}} <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> {{criticism}} that Mazda withstood, GM felt it could meet 1975 emissions standards with the engine tuned to provide better mileage. Other refinements improved mileage to a remarkable 20 mpg, but with the fuel breakthrough came related side-effect problems [...] apex seal failures, {{as well as a}} rotor tip-seal problem. By December 1973, it was clear the Wankel, now planned for the Monza 2+2, would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time {{for the start of the}} 1975 model year. and after paying another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, the company announced the first postponement. Motor Trend in April 1974 predicted the final outcome [...] On September 24, 1974, Cole postponed the Wankel engine ostensibly due to emissions difficulties and retired the same month. General Motors admitted fuel economy for the rotary was sub-standard and postponed production in favor of further development. Pete Estes succeeded Cole as GM's president and never showed any special interest in the Wankel or in the perpetuation of Cole's ideas.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the first}} mass-produced American {{passenger}} car with four-wheel-drive of any type, automotive industry analysts {{were taken by}} surprise {{at the fact that}} AMC, a company most had deemed past its ability to produce competitive vehicles, turned the best of what they had into a revolutionary, novel, and all-around competent vehicle. In doing so, the small American manufacturer was seen as having cleverly pioneered a new market segment - one that would grow wildly over the next 25 years and beyond, as evinced by Four Wheeler magazine's conclusion in 1980 that the new AMC Eagle was, indeed, [...] "The beginning {{of a new generation of}} cars." [...] Even as the automaker was struggling financially, [...] "AMC's reputation for developing vehicles on the cheap is only exceeded by its legacy of midwifing the SUV", including the Eagle to be the precursor to one of the most popular vehicle types on the market. Indeed, the Eagle's basic concept - that of a station wagon with AWD, raised ground clearance, full range of power options and automatic transmissions, as well as rough-road capability - has inspired vehicles like the Subaru Outback and Forester lines, the Audi Allroad, the Volkswagen Passat Alltrack, the Volvo XC range, and many others. Similarly, motoring journalist Marty Padgett described AMC's car-based 1980 Eagle, combining all-weather capability with better <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> as [...] "the first crossover," [...] that was succeeded by whole generations of Subaru vehicles and other models.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in showrooms on 28 February 1975, the Pacer was {{designed}} to attract buyers of traditional large cars to a smaller package {{during a time when}} gasoline prices were projected to rise dramatically. In its first year of production, the Pacer sold well, with 145,528 units. [...] There was little competition from other American manufacturers, most of whom had been blindsided by the oil crisis. The increased demand for compact, economy vehicles was growing rapidly. However, Pacer sales fell after the first two years, though the car continued to be built through the 1980 model year. Similar to its mid-year introduction, on 3 December 1979, production of the Pacer ended at the Kenosha, Wisconsin assembly plant where it had begun five years earlier. A total of 280,000 cars were built. Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to imported cars during the late 1970s are cited as the reasons for this outcome. Automobile buyers in the U.S. became adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, particularly the imports that offered better <b>gas</b> <b>mileage</b> presented, the AMC Pacer could not match the German and Japanese cars. Also the large glass areas increased the car's weight. With 22 miles per gallon the Pacer was unattractive for customers in the 1979 energy crisis. AMCs partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named [...] "Le Car" [...] to the AMC dealers. The design of the Pacer gave a little touch to the restyling of the Renault 5 to meet wishes and requirements of the American Market.|$|E

We can then compare the Cadillac models (the last three plots) with the AMC models (the first three plots). This comparison shows distinct patterns. The AMC models tend to be inexpensive, have below average <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> and are small in both height and weight and in roominess. The Cadillac models are expensive, have poor <b>gas</b> <b>mileage,</b> and are large in both size and roominess.|$|E
