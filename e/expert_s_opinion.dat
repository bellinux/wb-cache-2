40|$|Economic {{progress}} and {{development has been}} linked to constructive entrepreneurship; understanding the individual and institutional variables that support entrepreneurial endeavours is thus critical for positive economic development. Measuring these levels of entrepreneurship is a relatively new concept however is ultimately crucial to economic growth. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and the Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) studies are currently the two largest studies of entrepreneurship measurement in the world. This study undertook to identify the validity of these reports in reference to the South African entrepreneurial ecosystem. The GEM and GEI frameworks were deconstructed and compared to one another as well as to <b>expert</b> <b>s</b> <b>opinions</b> in the field of entrepreneurship within South Africa. Thematic analysis of interviews and GEM and GEI results were also contrasted against one another. South African experts in the field of entrepreneurship suggested some measurement indicators used in the reports may be flawed. Emergent themes from interviews demonstrate how certain positive social policies may be destructive economic policies. While entrepreneurship does exist, it may be of a destructive nature / economic consequence, such as rent seeking activities. Neither report discusses productive, destructive or unproductive entrepreneurship and does not attempt to measure it. Ultimately both the GEM and GEI do not show any major structural gaps in framework on a global scale however when used locally they do demonstrate subjective gaps in a South African contextMini-dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|When {{a federal}} appellate court decided {{last year that}} two reporters must either reveal their {{confidential}} sources {{to a grand jury}} or face jail time, the court did not hesitate in relying on the majority opinion in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s sole comment on the reporter 2 ̆ 7 s privilege [...] Branzburg v. Hayes. 2 ̆ 2 The Highest Court has spoken and never revisited the question. Without doubt, that {{is the end of the}} matter, 2 ̆ 2 Judge Sentelle wrote for the three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. By this declaration, the court dismissed with a wave of its judicial hand the arguments made by the reporters and media amici that the court should follow the more lenient concurring opinion of the fifth justice in Branzburg, Justice Powell, rather than the restrictive opinion of the Court authored by Justice White. The reporters had contended that while Justice White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> rejected any constitutional privilege in this situation, Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence advocated a case-by-case balancing approach and thus left an opening for a constitutionally based privilege. Because it provided the crucial fifth vote in the case and was the 2 ̆ 2 least common denominator 2 ̆ 2 between the views of the majority and the dissenters, Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> should control, the reporters had submitted. The reporter 2 ̆ 7 s argument was certainly not a new one; numerous courts and commentators had interpreted Branzburg in the same manner. The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals all have pronounced Justice White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> to be a mere 2 ̆ 2 plurality. 2 ̆ 2 And Justice Stewart, the chief dissenter in Branzburg, later declared that the case was decided by 2 ̆ 2 a vote of four a half to four and a half. 2 ̆ 2 Some courts and commentators, moreover, have concluded that Branzburg was a five to four victory for the press, with Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence plus the four dissenters actually creating a qualified reporter 2 ̆ 7 s privilege [...] the exact holding Justice White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> rejected. As Professor Rodney Smolla surmissed, 2 ̆ 2 [t]he important point of the story [was] that a short concurring opinion by a Justice who actually joined the opinion of the Court in Branzburg in effect superseded the majority opinion and became the prevailing law of the land. 2 ̆ 2 The D. C. Circuit, however, would have none of it. Writing with an air of perplexity in response to the reporters 2 ̆ 7 argument, the panel easily dismissed Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence as mere surplusage: 2 ̆ 2 Justice White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> is not a plurality opinion of four justices joined by a separate Justice Powell to create a majority, it is an opinion of the majority of the Court. As such it is authoritative precedent. It says what it says. It rejects the privilege asserted by appellants [...] In any event, whatever Justice Powell specifically intended, he joined the majority. 2 ̆ 2 Scanning the D. C. Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision on my way to teach Branzburg to my Media Law Seminar, I was surprised by the panel 2 ̆ 7 s surety that White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> should be treated as a true majority. What exactly made the D. C. Circuit so confident of Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s acquiescence in Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning, particularly when Powell 2 ̆ 7 s separate writing seemed to contradict it? If White 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> were treated as a plurality, when Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence would be the law. So why such faith that the White opinion governs...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{comparable}} worth {{has as its}} factual predicate two typical characteristics of women 2 ̆ 7 s employment: occupational concentration or segregation and significantly lower wages compared to those paid to men. What continues to be most troubling about this employment pattern is its stubborn persistence, despite the increased presence {{of women in the}} workforce and the existence for over two decades of legislation prohibiting sex discrimination in employment. The concept of comparable worth has provoked an outpouring of emotional rhetoric and scholarly analysis debating the concept’s viability and desirability. Rather than add to that debate, Professor Dowd traces the evolution of the framework within which comparable worth has developed as a legal doctrine. Furthermore, she identifies the unresolved issues and the strategic choices concerning those issues that may determine the future scope of the concept of comparable worth. The article is divided into three sections. First, it examines comparable worth litigation from its emergence in the 1970 s through 1986. The article then focuses in detail on three recent opinions and their impact on the current framework of comparable worth litigation: the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> reversing the landmark Washington State case; the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> granting limited reinstatement of the complaint in the American Nurses Associations case; and the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> analyzing historic wage discrimination in the Bazemore case. Finally, the article considers the future of the concept of comparable worth in light of the unresolved issues surrounding the scope of this legal doctrine and the impact of litigation strategy on the resolution of those issues...|$|R

The significance of existence of a scholar 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>opinion</b> is accepted only after there is activity of the court which produces a judicial precedent. If a constitutional interpretation bears in mind the interpretation and application in a court, this relation nature cannot be denied.

This paper examines the Kyotohu-Gakuren case. 　When the proposition which draws the conclusion of a concrete incident directly is understood as a ”judicial precedent”, it is the following proposition that it can be said to be a ”judicial precedent” in Kyotohu-Gakuren case: When it is admitted that a crime is performed now or there {{is not a}}n interval after it was performed, and there are the necessity and urgency of perpetuation of evidence, and when the photography is performed by the reasonable method which does not surpass the limit generally permitted, photography of the appearance of the individual by the policeman is not Article 13 violation of the constitution. 　When a ”judicial precedent” is understood widely, the following propositions will be treated as ”judicial precedent” shown by Kyotohu-Gakuren case: (A) The freedom on an individual private life is protected to use of national power by Article 13 of the constitution, and (B) That freedom is not necessarily protected without any restriction. When there is necessity for public welfare, receiving considerable restriction is defined by Article 13 of the constitution. And the (B) is more important for conclusions of judgments. 　Scholars should argue about how is the logic of (B) refuted. According to each right and freedom, scholars should discuss concrete problems about the irrational nature of regulation, or an examination standard and the importance of a right. 　I think that the problem of the ”security range” is not the theme about which it should argue earnestly...|$|R
