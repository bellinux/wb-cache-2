5|$|Despite a {{recovering}} economy from the Asian Financial Crisis, mismanagement of Tung's housing policy triggered a housing market crisis in 1998, disrupting market supply and sent properties prices tumbling until 2002. This caused many <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> become bankrupt due to negative equity.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|Just {{days after}} Irene moved through Florida, President Bill Clinton {{declared}} 18counties as disaster areas. The declaration allowed affected businesses and <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> apply for federal assistance, such as money for temporary housing, minor home repairs, or disaster-related expenses. In addition, the president issued an emergency declaration for Florida, which released federal resources {{to aid in}} debris removal and emergency services. In addition, President Clinton declared the 66counties in North Carolina eligible for assistance due to Hurricane Floyd were also eligible for more assistance due to damage from Irene.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and the waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> attach wall-mounted mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to lean over to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|E
50|$|Each Retirement Living {{development}} incorporates features {{specifically for}} the older <b>homeowner,</b> <b>to</b> make life easier in retirement. A typical development consists of circa 40 one and two bed apartments, a House Manager plus shared facilities such as a homeowners’ lounge, guest suite and laundry. <b>Homeowners</b> have <b>to</b> be 60 or over to live in most developments.|$|R

50|$|Hope Now {{describes}} the assistance {{that it provides}} <b>to</b> <b>homeowners</b> as loan workouts, a form of loss mitigation. These workouts can either result in establishing a modified repayment plan with the <b>homeowner</b> <b>to</b> bring them up to date, or a loan modification where {{the terms of the}} mortgage are modified {{in order to make the}} loan serviceable for the homeowner.|$|R
25|$|The government's role as {{the primary}} {{investor}} allows a systematic loan refinancing process to be implemented. This should enable rapid loan adjustments or workouts for homeowners, which have been facing bottlenecks due to the requirement to have various investors approve the adjustments. For example, the government could rapidly push-down 45-year mortgage terms and fixed, low interest rates, enabling many more <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> stay in their homes. This will reduce foreclosures significantly, helping to stabilize home prices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then {{inflated}} against a two-part mold to form {{them into the}} final shape of the bottle. Preforms (uninflated bottles) are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some Red Cross chapters distribute {{them as part of}} the Vial of Life program to <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> store medical history for emergency responders. Another increasingly common use for the preforms are containers in the outdoor activity geocaching.|$|E
25|$|Numerous sparsely settled {{villages in}} rural areas in Finland are not {{connected}} to municipal water supply or sewer networks, requiring <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> operate their own systems. Individual private wells, i.e. shallow dug wells or boreholes in the bedrock, are often used for water supply, and many homeowners have opted for composting toilets. In addition, these toilets are common at holiday homes, often located near sensitive water bodies. For these reasons, many manufacturers of composting toilets are based in Finland, including Biolan, Ekolet, Kekkilä, Pikkuvihreä and Raita Environment.|$|E
50|$|When refinancing, if the <b>homeowner</b> wants <b>to</b> refinance {{the first}} {{mortgage}} {{and keep the}} second mortgage, the <b>homeowner</b> has <b>to</b> request a subordination from the second lender to let the new first lender step into the first lien holder position.|$|R

During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle slum landlords who charged high rents but refused {{to spend money on}} keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} ways to improve energy {{conservation}} in buildings is to use an energy audit. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system {{to reduce the amount}} of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output(s). This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above. In addition, recent development of smartphone apps enable <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> complete relatively sophisticated energy audits themselves.|$|E
25|$|Event-driven SOA {{software}} {{could allow}} <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> customize {{many different types}} of electricity devices found within their home to a desired level of comfort or economy. The event-driven software could also automatically respond to changing electricity prices, in as little as five-minute intervals. For example, to reduce the home owner's electricity usage in peak periods (when electricity is most expensive), the software could automatically lower the target temperature of the thermostat on the central heating system (in winter) or raise the target temperature of the thermostat on the central cooling system (in summer).|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles-based Mike Davis, in his seminal {{work on the}} city, City of Quartz, {{describes}} the process of gradually convincing Chavez Ravine <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> sell. With {{nearly all of the}} original Spanish-speaking homeowners initially unwilling to sell, developers resorted to offering immediate cash payments, distributed through their Spanish-speaking agents. Once the first sales had been completed, remaining homeowners were offered increasingly lesser amounts of money, to create a community panic of not receiving fair compensation, or of being left {{as one of the few}} holdouts. Many residents continued to hold out despite the pressure being placed upon them by developers, resulting in the Battle of Chavez Ravine, an unsuccessful ten-year struggle by the residents to maintain control of their property.|$|E
500|$|A {{study of}} a sample taken of {{affected}} areas suggested that roughly 62% of buildings in the affected areas suffered damage to roofs, around 34% to windows and 53% to vehicles. [...] Construction of infrastructure for 2000 Sydney Olympics in the city's west at the time meant there was a deficiency of tradespeople who could be contracted to repair roofs and windows. Estimates put between 45,000 and 50,000 tradespeople in Sydney {{at the time of}} the storm, yet owing to high demand [...] "companies were quoting householders $14,000 or more for roof repairs which would normally cost $3,000." [...] The situation led to a warning from Minister for Fair Trade John Watkins on the day following the storm, urging <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> ensure that tradespeople working to repair homes were fully qualified and legitimate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the capital}} city of Manila, power was knocked out, {{resulting}} in many downed trees, and numerous landslides were reported. [...] The city itself suffered widespread flooding which left about 6,000homeless, but no casualties were reported. The suburb of Marikina, however, sustained the worst impact of all Manila suburbs from the typhoon, where a river overflowed its banks, and 15,000people were reported homeless. According to press reports, water levels in one subdivision of the suburb were nearly [...] high, which forced <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> either hang on to oil containers, the trunks of banana trees, and other debris to stay afloat, or climb to the rooftops of the few two-story homes in Marinka. Throughout the city, 11casualties were reported.

500|$|Local {{historic}} {{districts are}} identified by surveying historic resources and delineating appropriate boundaries that comply with {{all aspects of}} due process. Depending on local ordinance or State law, property owners permission may be required; however all owners are to be notified and {{given a chance to}} share their opinion. Most local historic districts are constricted by design guidelines that control changes to the properties included in the district. Many local commissions adopt specific guidelines for the [...] "tout ensemble" [...] of each neighborhood, although some smaller commissions rely on the Secretary of Interior Standards. For most minor changes, homeowners can consult with local preservation staff at the municipal office and receive guidance on and permission for the changes. Major changes however, require <b>homeowners</b> <b>to</b> apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA), and the changes may be decided upon by the historic commission or architectural review board. The COA process is carried out with all aspects of due process, with formal notification, hearings, and fair and informed decision making.|$|E
