40|$|The figure depicts an {{apparatus}} that pulverizes brittle material {{by means of}} a combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibration, hammering, and abrasion. The basic design of the apparatus could be specialized to be a portable version for use by a geologist in collecting powdered rock samples for analysis in the field or in a laboratory. Alternatively, a larger benchtop version could be designed for milling and mixing of precursor powders for such purposes as synthesis of ceramic and other polycrystalline materials or preparing powder samples for x-ray diffraction or x-ray fluorescence measurements to determine crystalline structures and compositions. Among the most attractive characteristics of this apparatus are its light weight and the ability to function without need for a large preload or a large power supply: It has been estimated that a portable version could have a mass < 0. 5 kg, would consume less than 1 W h of energy in milling a 1 -cm 3 volume of rock, and could operate at a preload < 10 N. The basic design and principle of operation of this apparatus {{are similar to those of}} other apparatuses described in a series of prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, the two most relevant being Ultrasonic/ Sonic Drill/Corers With Integrated Sensors (NPO- 20856), Vol. 25, No. 1 (January 2001), page 38 and Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanisms for Deep Drilling and Coring (NPO- 30291), Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. As before, vibrations are excited {{by means of a}} piezoelectric actuator, an ultrasonic horn, and a mass that is free to move axially over a limited range. As before, the ultrasonic harmonic motion of the horn drives the free-mass in a combination of ultrasonic harmonic and lower-frequency hammering motion. In this case, the free-mass is confined within a hollow cylinder that serves as a crushing chamber, and the free-mass serves as a crushing or milling tool. The hammering of the free-mass against a material sample at the lower end of the <b>chamber</b> <b>grinds</b> the sample into powder in a relatively short time. The restriction of the free-mass to axial motion only makes the grinding very efficient. The free-mass can be fabricated to have teeth on its lower face to enhance the grinding effect.

The disks contain slots to allow the ore slurry to pass from the feed end to the discharge end (see Figure 3). The area between each disk is effectively an individual <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the grinding medium is set in motion by the rotation of the disks, which accelerate the medium toward the shell. This action is most pronounced close to the disks. The medium flows back toward the shaft in the zone near the midpoint between the disks, creating a circulation of the grinding medium between each pair of disks, as shown in Figure 4.|$|E

Middle size particles shift to wall by centrifugal force in a big chamber of a classifier and fall down to cone (6) and later they move into an accelerator (2).

40|$|Discharge of finer rock, pebbles, ball scats and slurry from {{mills and}} its flow through trommels and into other {{processing}} operations all affect {{the performance of}} overflow ball mills. Modelling of the coarser rock components and the grinding media is best done using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) while modelling of the slurry component is best done using a compatible particle method such as SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics). This combination of methods allows both these critical components and their interactions {{to be included in}} flow models for the mill and discharge arrangements. Information from such models can be used to both understand the flows in these typically closed and data poor environments and to help optimise designs for improved performance and superior wear life. In this paper, a typical discharge/trommel arrangement for an overflow ball mill is analysed using this modelling approach with opportunities for use in process improvement discussed. In the mill <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> the addition of slurry was found to lower the charge shoulder and toe positions due to drag forces on the media, as well as produce a large slurry pool above the toe.

40|$|Slurry flow, {{including}} {{flow through}} the charge in the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber,</b> through the discharge grates, along the pulp lifters and its discharge from the mill is an important contributor to {{the efficiency of the}} grinding process within a SAG mill. Poor transport of finer ground material can adversely affect grinding leading to excess energy consumption and over-grinding of fine material. This paper uses a 1 -way coupled DEM-SPH method in three dimensions to analyse the full slurry flow for a 1. 8 m diameter by 0. 6 m long AG/SAG pilot mill. This provides detailed information on the internal flow of slurry within a SAG mill, including the prediction of dry regions and of slurry pooling. The importance of the end walls in generating complex three dimensional recirculation patterns in the charge and its influence on axial flow is demonstrated. Such a full 3 D analysis ensures that the slurry is presented to the grate with a realistic spatial distribution and allows prediction of the {{flow through the}} grates and then within the pulp chamber. The rate of filling of the pulp chambers, the point of initiation of flow down along the rising pulp lifters, back flow into the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> and flow onto the discharge cone are all investigated.

ABSTRACT: The {{necessity}} of applying materials with {{high degree of}} fineness in the contemporary technologies require used to modern technology in mechanical comminution of different substances, which will assure demanded particle size distribution of grinding product. The scientific performances are mostly aimed at the search for new work conditions of industrial grinding devices, which should guarantee parameters and fineness of grinding products and should decrease energy consuming of grinding and improve environmental protection. All the above seems to be met in the researches of granular materials grinding in the high-energetic fluidized bed. The fluidized jet grinding relies on keeping up a turbulent fluidization in the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> of mill, which {{is a result of}} collisions of air counter-fluxes. They make it possible to obtain high-energetic fluidized bed, which in turn ensures an effective comminution of tested granular material. The state of pulsatory fluidization is created in the certain surroundings of an axial zone of the fluidized bed. The state of fountain fluidization is created in the axial zone of the fluidized bed, which is characterised by carryover of grains in the zone of high velocities in the centre core of <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber,</b> then by gravitational falling of coarse fraction near walls and by carrying away of the small fraction by the flowing gas into the separation system. The theoretical basis and experimental results for the fluidized jet grinding of granular materials are presented in the paper. The researches were performed on a laboratory fluidized bed opposed jet mill. The experiment contained grinding tests of selected narrow size fraction of limestone in turbulent fluidized layer conditions. The aim of researches was to explain the influence of the values of rotational speed of flow classifier rotor on the efficiency of mill and the particle size distribution of grinding product. The determined masses and particle size distribution of grinding products make it possible to estimate the quality and the efficiency of the carried out fluidized jet grinding tests.

40|$|Work {{continued}} {{during the}} past quarter to improve {{the performance of the}} POC-scale unit. For the charging system, a more robust ''turbocharger'' has been fabricated and installed. All of the internal components of the charger have been constructed from the same material (i. e., Plexiglas) to prevent particles from contacting surfaces with different work functions. For the electrode system, a new set of vinyl-coated electrodes have been constructed and tested. The coated electrodes (i) allow higher field strengths to be tested without of risk of arcing and (ii) minimize the likelihood of charge reversal caused by particles colliding with the conducting surfaces of the uncoated electrodes. Tests are underway to evaluate these modifications. Several different coal samples were collected for testing during this reporting period.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} slurry transportation in autogenous (ag) and semi-autogenous (sag) grinding mills {{have become more}} apparent in recent years with the increasing trend to build larger diameter mills for grinding high tonnages. This is particularly noticeable when ag/sag mills are run in closed circuit with classifiers such as fine screens/cyclones. Extensive test work carried out on slurry removal mechanism in grate discharge mills (ag/sag) {{has shown that the}} conventional pulp lifters (radial and curved) have inherent drawbacks. They allow short-circuiting of the slurry from pulp lifters into the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> leading to slurry pool formation. Slurry pool absorbs part of the impact thus inhibiting the grinding process. Twin Chamber Pulp Lifter (TCPL) - an efficient design of pulp lifter developed by the authors overcomes the inherent drawbacks of the conventional pulp lifters. Extensive testing in both laboratory and pilot scale mills has shown that the TCPL completely blocks the flow-back process, thus allowing the mill to operate close to their design flow capacity. The TCPL performance is also found to be independent of variations in charge volume and grate design, whereas they significantly affect the performance of conventional pulp lifters (radial and curved).

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of trace gases from fluid inclusions of minerals has been developed. The purge and trap GC-MS system is based on the system described by Nolting et al. (1988) and was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) having boiling points as low as - 128. °C (carbon tetrafluoride). The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C. The process is carried out by using a pressurized air stream to dissipate the liquid nitrogen followed by resistive heating of the trap. The design of the cold trap and the direct transfer of desorbed analytes onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample refocusing within the GC oven unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Mohs scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> with a He carrier gas flow.

40|$|In a {{printing}} ink plant, phthalocyanine (Pc) aqueous slurries {{are produced by}} grinding the Pc pigment in water using a media mill. Mostly, dispersions of Pc in water are used in heat-set printing inks to make the color phthalo blue. Typically, Pc slurries are 40 - 50 % solids and ground with steel media (spherical beads) to produce a stabilized dispersion with 99. 9 percent of all solid particles less than 0. 5 microns in size. Vertical media mills have been the industry norm; however, in producing submicron particle sizes, the efficiency is {{less than that of}} newer horizontal media mills that feature high internal flow and multiple pass grinding (Savastano, 2004). The goal of this experimental {{study was to determine the}} optimum operating conditions for a small industrial unit that incorporates newer technology. The first objective was to demonstrate in the laboratory the efficacy of grinding aqueous slurries of Pc using a horizontal peg media mill whose <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> has a small length to width ratio. This was accomplished using a 0. 55 L Labstar Zeta mill, producing a satisfactory dispersion. A second objective in the laboratory was to optimize operating conditions (shot loading, agitator speed, and pump speed) in order to minimize the grinding time to produce acceptable product. The optimized conditions were: shot loading level of 85 %; agitator speed of 3000 RPM; and pump speed of 200 RPM yielding a run time of 1. 33 hours (80 minutes). The success of this project enabled an industrial chemical company to quickly bring a new 25 L unit on stream to grind and disperse Pc in water.

40|$|Stirred media milling is a {{prospective}} technology for producing colloidal dispersions {{by means of}} wet grinding process. In the past, many researchers have studied the effects of different operating parameters such as size, shape, nature and quantity of grinding medium, the speed of agitator in <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber,</b> the feed rate of dispersions, etc. in stirred media mills. However, it is still less known how particle sizing which generates valuable information of particle size of the product to interpret, control and optimize the grinding process, {{is influenced by the}} concentration of the dispersion during stirred media milling where particles change their size from micron to colloidal range rapidly. One of the reasons of this lack had been our incapability in the past to study the particle size distribution of dispersions without dilution. The recent advent of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy is known to be capable of studying dispersions without dilution, under real process conditions and on line. The study employs acoustic attenuation spectroscopy to investigate the effects of concentration of dispersions of CaCO 3 on its particle sizing during size reduction process in a stirred media mill (LabStar manufactured by NETZSCH). The dispersions of CaCO 3 at 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % (m/m) were studied about six hours under a selected set of operating conditions. Contrary to the existing knowledge obtained through other techniques of particle sizing that are based on the principle of dilution, acoustic attenuation spectroscopy shows that, under certain grinding time at given operating conditions, increase in concentration of dispersion results in better grinding results yielding smaller particles. The causes behind the differences in results of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering have been thoroughly investigated. We find certain limitations of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy in particle sizing. A typical phenomenon which causes misleading trends in particle sizing is multiple scattering in acoustic measurements. Multiple scattering, particularly, influences acoustic results when particles approach to fine size range during size reduction process...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic halocarbons (VOX) play an {{important}} role in atmospheric processes. However, biogeochemical release mechanisms from terrestrial environments are complex, not well understood in most parts and a clear view of their relative importance is lacking. Previously, the lithospheric VOX formation potential was subject of only few studies. In the first part of this thesis the development of a new method for the analysis of VOX from rocks and minerals is reported in order to investigate terrigenic VOX formation potential. The purge and trap GC-MS system was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds having boiling points as low as - 128 °C for carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4). The design of the U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™) cold trap for sample preconcentration and the rapid desorption via resistant heating transferred the desorbed analytes directly onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample re-focussing unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Moh’s scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> with a He carrier gas flow. In the second part of this work, the newly developed method is applied to a set of various mineral and rock samples including fluorite, quartz and halite. The analytical results from GC-MS prove the presence of a wide spectrum of volatile compounds from FIs trapped in various minerals. SF 6 and CF 4 were released from fluorites. Methyl bromide, dichloroethene and dichloroethane were detected in quartz samples from the Archean Yilgarn craton in Australia. Methyl chloride (MeCl) has been detected from almost all samples, including halites, fluorites, quartz and dolerites. Initial heating experiments with halites using purge-and-trap GC-MS as well as pyrolysis-GC-MS demonstrated the important role of temperature in MeCl and VOX formation. Finally, in the last part of this dissertation a case study on one possible formation pathway for the volatile compounds MeCl and dimethylsulfide (DMS), via thermolytic degradation of the amino acid derivative methyl methionine is investigated. A fast response of MeCl and dimethylsulfide emission upon heating of freeze-dried samples at 40 °C was observed and made this a plausible abiotic volatile formation mechanism. Besides the mechanistic studies with methyl methionine and structurally related substances, the emission of MeCl and DMS from fluid inclusions, soil samples of terrestrial salt lakes and air sampled immediately above the salt lake surfaces indicated the relevance of this formation pathway for hypersaline environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{grinding}} {{efficiency of}} semi autogenous milling or ball milling {{depends on the}} tumbling motion of the total charge within the mill. Utilization of this tumbling motion for efficient breakage of particles depends on the conditions inside the mill. However, any kind of monitoring device to measure the conditions inside the mill shell during operation is virtually impossible due to the severe environment presented by the tumbling charge. An instrumented grinding ball, which {{is capable of surviving}} a few hours and transmitting the impacts it experiences, is proposed here. The spectrum of impacts collected over 100 revolutions of the mills presents the signature of the grinding environment inside mill. This signature could be effectively used to optimize the milling performance by investigating this signature's relation to mill product size, mill throughput, make-up ball size, mill speed, liner profile and ball addition rates. At the same time, it {{can also be used to}} design balls and liner systems that can survive longer in the mill. The technological advances made in electronics and communication makes this leap in instrumentation certainly viable. Hence, the instrumented grinding ball offers the ability to qualitatively observe and optimize the milling environment. An instrumented load cell package that can measure the force of impacts inside the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> of a mill is developed here. The signal from the instrumented load cell package is interpreted in terms of a histogram termed as an impact spectrum which is a plot of the number of impacts at a specific energy level against the energy. It reflects on the average force regime of the mill. The instrumented load cell package was calibrated against the ultra fast load cell which has been unanimously accepted as a standard to measure single breakage events. The load cell package was successfully used to produce impact spectra in an 8. 5 inch lab scale mill. The mill speed and the ball size were varied to study their effect on the impact spectra. A good correlation was found between the process variables and the impact spectra. The load cell package was then used in a 16 inch pilot scale mill. The mill speed, ball size, and mill filling were varied here and a consistent trend between these variables and impact spectra was observed. With a better understanding developed from the initial tests, the design of the load cell package was significantly changed to eliminate noise. With the new design, the impact spectra were re-determined in the 16 inch pilot mill varying the process variables - ball size, mill speed, and mill filling. Finally, it is successfully shown that a change in the operating variables of a mill can be seen in the impact spectra and that this concept can be successfully developed to monitor the grinding operation of industrial mills. To adapt it to industrial level it is mandatory to make the load cell package wireless. A design of a wireless circuit that is capable of transferring data at the required speed of 1000 kbps was also developed and tested at Cortez Gold Mines (CGM), Nevada...|$|E
40|$|Spiral {{jet milling}} is a size {{reduction}} process used in various industries, ranging from paints to food and pharmaceuticals. It has great benefit in {{the pharmaceutical industry}} due to its ability to reduce particulate solids to micron sizes and narrow size distributions. Despite its heavy usage, the underlying size reduction mechanism of the mill is not well understood. However it is generally known that the milling behaviour {{is dependent on the}} grinding conditions of the mill, as well as the materials physical and mechanical properties. The system is also very energy inefficient. In this work the milling behaviour of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients in the spiral jet mill has been analysed based on their mechanical properties, as established from the Ghadiri and Zhang semi-brittle breakage model. Using the Single Particle Impact Test Rig, the breakability index (αH/KC 2) of three pharmaceutical materials (paracetamol, aspirin, and α-lactose monohydrate) is determined. It is shown that the order of breakability is paracetamol > aspirin > α-lactose monohydrate. For milling studies the Hosokawa Alpine Aeroplex Spiral Jet Mill 50 AS is used. The change in specific surface area (ΔSSA) due to milling is quantified by size analysis and related to the breakability indices. The order of ΔSSA is α-lactose monohydrate > paracetamol > aspirin at high grinding pressure conditions. The loading of particles in the <b>grinding</b> <b>chamber</b> of the mill is found to be an important characteristic for the classification of milled materials in addition to the effects of centrifugal and drag forces. Numerical simulations have been carried out and used to analyse the behaviour of the spiral jet mill. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics, the mechanics of internal particle classification by size of the 50 AS has been analysed. Particles of 2 µm and less are shown to be classified. The Discrete Element Method is coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics to investigate the effect of grinding conditions and particle properties on the particle motion and fluid-particle energy transfer, including gas pressure, the number of particles and the particle size distribution. A very small amount of energy is transferred to the particles from the fluid, highlighting the energy inefficiency of the system. Interparticle interactions are found to have a greater amount of dissipated energy compared to particle-wall interactions, which suggests interparticle collisions are the primary source of particle breakage. The majority of the stress exerted on the particles is close to the wall of the mill, with the normal stress being greater than the shear stress. A very low proportion of particles are found to be in contact at a given time, indicating particle breakage occurs from instantaneous collisions rather than particles shearing against each other. Finally the potential for scale-up of the spiral jet mill is investigated based on the fluid power input to the system. There is a good comparison of the ΔSSA of α-lactose monohydrate milled in four different mills at similar fluid power input conditions. Two of the mills are the 50 AS and the Hosokawa Alpine Piconizer (33 AS), and the other two are of different design but with internal diameters of 2 inches and 4 inches, i. e. roughly similar size to the Hosokawa mills. The latter two mills had a greater fluid power as the grinding nozzle diameters are larger than the Hosokawa mills...|$|E
