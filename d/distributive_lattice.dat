25|$|Given a lattice with {{a bottom}} element 0 {{and a top}} element 1, a pair x,y of {{elements}} is called complementary when x∧y= 0 and x∨y= 1, and we then say that y is a complement of x and vice versa. Any element x of a <b>distributive</b> <b>lattice</b> with top and bottom can have at most one complement. When every element of a lattice has a complement the lattice is called complemented. It follows that in a complemented <b>distributive</b> <b>lattice,</b> the complement of an element always exists and is unique, making complement a unary operation. Furthermore, every complemented <b>distributive</b> <b>lattice</b> forms a Boolean algebra, and conversely every Boolean algebra forms a complemented <b>distributive</b> <b>lattice.</b> This provides an alternative definition of a Boolean algebra, namely as any complemented <b>distributive</b> <b>lattice.</b> Each of these three properties can be axiomatized with finitely many equations, whence these equations taken together constitute a finite axiomatization of the equational theory of Boolean algebras.|$|E

We characterize the topological counterpart of these algebras in terms of suitable coalgebras on spectral spaces.

40|$|The {{class of}} finite <b>distributive</b> <b>lattices,</b> {{as many other}} classes of {{structures}} in everyday use, {{does not have the}} Ramsey property. It is quite common, though, that after expanding the structures with appropriatelly chosen linear orders the resulting class has the Ramsey property. So, one might expect that a similar result holds for the class of all finite <b>distributive</b> <b>lattices.</b> Surprisingly, Kechris and Sokic have proved in 2012 {{that this is not the}} case: no expansion of the class of finite <b>distributive</b> <b>lattices</b> by linear orders satisfies the Ramsey property. In this paper we prove that the class of finite <b>distributive</b> <b>lattices</b> does not have the dual Ramsey property either. However, we are able to derive a dual Ramsey theorem for finite <b>distributive</b> <b>lattices</b> endowed with a particular linear order.

25|$|A poset antimatroid {{has as its}} {{feasible}} {{sets the}} lower sets of a finite partially ordered set.

25|$|In any partial order, {{the lower}} sets form a lattice {{in which the}} lattice's partial {{ordering}} is given by set inclusion, the join operation corresponds to set union, and the meet operation corresponds to set intersection, because unions and intersections preserve the property of being a lower set.
