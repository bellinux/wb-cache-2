5|$|Captain John Saris {{may have}} brought back {{examples}} of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan {{on behalf of}} the United States in the mid-19th century. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, an Elderly manager {{told the}} {{publication}} TWICE that economic recession had affected {{the business and}} forced layoffs of part-time employees, and that Elderly's being in Michigan worsened the effects. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> as the consumer electronics business began to recover, the musical instrument business followed.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
50|$|Lichtenstein {{says that}} he cleaned up Van Gogh's version and jokes {{that it would be}} to Van Gogh's liking, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the vast contrast between his cartoonish style and the original is in and of itself humorous. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> his work is meticulous, while Van Gogh's was spontaneous. <b>He</b> also <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> his translation is no more debasing to the master than were Pablo Picasso's translations of Diego Velázquez.|$|R

5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. He felt that the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall {{had been replaced by}} newer shooter games.|$|E
5|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{concurring opinion}} that {{argued that the}} Indian tribes have a {{stronger}} claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5000|$|Mises biographer Jörg Guido Hülsmann {{says that}} critics who suggest that Mises {{supported}} fascism are [...] "absurd", as <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the full quote describes fascism as dangerous. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> Mises {{thought it was}} a [...] "fatal error" [...] to think that it was more than an [...] "emergency makeshift" [...] against the looming threat of communism and socialism, as exemplified by the Bolsheviks in Russia.|$|R

5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect and accept the ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Thomas of Marlborough, {{who was a}} monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a {{case for}} Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also {{described}} the three men as magistri mei in scholis. Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law. Thomas appears to have studied under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.|$|E
5000|$|Fr. Gabriele Amorth, {{who claimed}} to have {{performed}} 160,000 exorcisms, said exorcists have the ability to detect an evil presence. However, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> [...] "they are not always right: their 'feelings' must be checked out." [...] In his examples, they are able to detect the events that caused the demon to enter, or are able to discover the evil object that has cursed the individual. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> [...] "they are always humble." ...|$|R
25|$|Łojek <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> historiography of {{the fall}} of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the {{interest}} in issues related to the French Revolution; as <b>he</b> <b>notes,</b> a war <b>that</b> never started is much less interesting than the revolution that changed the world. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the end of the alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.|$|R

5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen as giving the green light for repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively.

5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the much higher tooth count and row of crests {{on top of the}} snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
