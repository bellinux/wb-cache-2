25|$|Back in the village, Gaston {{meets with}} the asylum owner Monsieur D'Arque. They plan to lock Maurice away to {{blackmail}} Belle into marrying Gaston ("Maison des Lunes"). In the castle, the Beast and Belle attend a lovely dinner and personal ball, where they dance {{together in the}} ballroom ("Beauty and the Beast"). The Beast, who plans to tell Belle he loves her, asks Belle if she is <b>happy</b> <b>here,</b> to which she responds positively but notes that she misses her father. He offers her his Magic Mirror to view him. She sees that Maurice is sick and lost {{in the woods and}} fears for his life. But even though the Beast knows there's only a few hours left till the last petal falls from the rose, he allows Belle to leave in order to save her father; she departs after a tearful goodbye ("If I Can't Love Her (Reprise)").|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistent}} performances, by December 2005 he {{had lost}} his place and there was speculation that he had fallen out with Taylor and wanted to leave; this was strongly denied by the player: [...] "I'm shocked that people are saying I want to go. I'm very <b>happy</b> <b>here.</b> ... It's taken me long enough to get to Hull so I'm not going to walk out after a few months, or whatever." [...] In the following six weeks he made only two brief substitute appearances– in five months with the club he played 18 games in the Championship without scoring – and the strength of Hull's squad was such that he could not be guaranteed regular first-team football.|$|E
500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, {{and it was no}} secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City. Commented Pérez: [...] "I feel <b>happy</b> <b>here.</b> I like the National League. I was happy in Colorado and I am happy here." [...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of the}} 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to [...]232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the [...] "odd man out" [...] and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004. Almost immediately the Chicago Cubs signed Pérez to a minor-league contract.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he says, [...] "that {{she will}} be <b>happier</b> <b>here,</b> {{and that they will}} value her better than she has been valued upon earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{was staying}} there. It was because I liked the place so much, and because I {{was so much}} <b>happier</b> <b>here</b> than in London, that I came back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{just the}} place for Gran'pa Jim," [...] she mused. [...] "There's no one to bother him with {{questions}} or sympathy and he can live as quietly as he likes and read those stuffy old books--the very name 'classics' makes me shudder--to his heart's content. He'll grow stronger and <b>happier</b> <b>here,</b> I'm sure." ...|$|R
500|$|Peggy {{was written}} out of EastEnders in 2003, sent {{to live in}} Rio de Janeiro with her son Grant for two years, while Windsor took a sabbatical from the show after being {{diagnosed}} with the Epstein-Barr virus. Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I'm so <b>happy</b> <b>here</b> on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good for me and for the character too." [...] Louise Berridge, then EastEnders executive producer, commented: [...] "Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show. We hope she has a great time and look forward to bringing her back with a big story in 2004." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Seven {{communications}} sent. Seven received. Health moderate. George [...] well, energetic, roughneck, {{reminds me}} my brother. Fed-up with war. Hopes deferred. Borneo {{is a beautiful}} place for living, a dreamland where the scenery is beautiful, little birds sing, very delicious fruits grow, we are very <b>happy</b> <b>here.</b> Agnes, Harry, [...] George" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dzierzon's {{questioning}} of papal infallibility {{caused him to}} be retired him from the priesthood in 1869. This disagreement, along with his public engagement in local politics, led to his 1873 excommunication. In 1884 he moved back to Lowkowitz, settling in the hamlet An der Grenze, (Granice Łowkowskie). Of his new home, he wrote:In every direction, one has a broad and pleasant view, and I am pretty <b>happy</b> <b>here,</b> despite the isolation, as I am always close to my beloved bees — which, if one's soul be receptive to {{the works of the}} Almighty and the wonders of nature, can transform even a desert into a paradise. From 1873 to 1902 Dzierzon was in contact with the Old Catholic Church, [...] but in April 1905 he was reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Later, Hawkpaw and Mothpaw {{discover}} {{the remnants of}} the Bonehill, a hill of bones that Tigerstar created in the events of The Darkest Hour. In the end, Sasha decides Clan life is not for her, and she also realizes that her kits are far safer and <b>happier</b> <b>here</b> than with her, so she leaves, but her kits stay.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mean,' said Mr Haredale, {{regarding}} {{her with}} some surprise, 'that having made this effort, you are resolved not to persevere and {{are determined to}} relapse? This is unworthy of you. I have often told you, you should return here. You would be <b>happier</b> <b>here</b> than elsewhere, I know. As to Barnaby, it's quite his home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't get new frocks now as I {{used to do}} in Rome. Aunt Emmeline was {{cruel to}} me, and said things which I could not bear. But they let me have everything. Uncle Reginald gives me all that he has, and I am much <b>happier</b> <b>here.</b> But we cannot {{go out and buy}} things,--can we, Aunt Margaret?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Eto'o {{refused to}} come on as a {{substitute}} in a league match against Racing de Santander on 11 February 2007. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, [...] "He {{did not want to}} come on; I don't know why." [...] Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, [...] "These kind of things are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, {{if it is true that}} I am a problem for my team then I will go. But like I said, I am <b>happy</b> <b>here.</b> The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} 2006 {{issue of the}} EMU alumni magazine, {{university}} president Loren Swartzendruber wrote a four-page essay on refusing the mantle of either liberal or conservative and daring to be [...] "different from other colleges," [...] in keeping with Anabaptist tradition and theology. [...] "How do we define ourselves within a cultural context that wants to reduce complex realities to simplistic clichés?" [...] he asked rhetorically. He told the online journal Inside Higher Ed: [...] "We are, I think, {{a different kind of}} Christian... If [...] assume they’re going to find at EMU what they would also find at Liberty University [...] they’re not going to be very <b>happy</b> <b>here.</b> They’re going to run into it headlong. They’re going to hear about the peace tradition. They’re going to hear a lot of language {{about what it means to}} be a follower of Jesus in this world. From our perspective, that means less nationalism, and a much more global perspective, care for creation. What they would find here is a concern for personal piety … but we’re not willing to stop there because we also believe that the New Testament is pretty clear that there is a social dimension to what Jesus called us to be and to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be <b>happy</b> <b>here</b> with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always <b>happy</b> <b>here,</b> but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

Great as the loss would be to you, I believe that you would be <b>happier</b> <b>here,</b> alone, than you would be were you to see him in {{constant}} trouble and worry. At any rate you would have the option, if you found life intolerably dull here, of joining him out there at any time.|$|R
