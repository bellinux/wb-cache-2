30|$|This study fills {{a gap in}} {{research}} on corruption and the ongoing anti-corruption campaign in China by examining the CCP’s discourse about corruption and anti-corruption policy. It also makes a methodological contribution to research on metaphor in use by <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> documents including newspaper texts. Furthermore, the comparison and contrast of the Chinese and English editions of the party newspaper takes corpus research of metaphors {{to a new level}} by exploring how the same party ideology and political agenda are framed for two different audiences. With this methodological innovation, this study makes a theoretical contribution by uncovering a clear pragmatic strategy in metaphor choice across languages, which is sensitive to culture-specific epistemic conventions and conceptual preoccupations. In this sense, the theoretical contribution rises above the mere confirmation that both culture and embodiment motivate metaphoric discourse.|$|E
40|$|Left-wing {{parties in}} {{contemporary}} democracies {{have to face}} huge organizational and competitive dilemmas. This article aims at <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> change and adaptation of leftwing parties by focusing on Southern European countries. By re-examining three key areas of party change – the linkage between parties and civil society, the ideological and programmatic dimension and party organization – this research contributes to understand the trajectory and the characteristics of contemporary left-wing parties. Although there is an increasing convergence {{with regard to the}} three dimensions, left-wing parties in new democracies are able to respond to more flexibly to external challenges compared to the main Italian left-wing party. This process shows that left-wing parties are adopting a model based on personalized leadership, moderate stances and flexible roots with regard to civil society. The different outcome of these responses is a central element for explaining the institutional and governmental performances. Yet this study argues that the success is inevitably fragile because of the erosion of stable partisan links between left-wing parties and the electorate...|$|E
40|$|This project <b>examines</b> <b>party</b> {{building}} in authoritarian regimes. The overarching puzzle I seek to address is: why are some autocratic ruling parties stronger organizations than others? What explains {{variation in the}} institutional capacity of autocratic rule? The collection of three essays in this dissertation outline the strategic logic of party institutionalization, {{in addition to providing}} new and original ways in which to measure this key concept of authoritarian party strength. It tests previously untested hypotheses about the origins of strong autocratic parties and provides insights on the conditions under which leaders will be incentivized to rule through binding institutions. The first paper conceptualizes autocratic party strength as institutionalization and provides new ways of measuring this variable. The second paper describes the strategic logic of party institutionalization in autocracies and explains why and when some autocrats choose to tie their own hands. The third paper evaluates the thesis that parties emerging out of revolutions and independence wars tend to be more durable by <b>examining</b> <b>parties</b> that emerged out of independence struggles in Africa...|$|R

These were {{with a view to}} <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> politics and the challenge of democratic consolidation in Nigeria. This area of political process has be a clog on the wheel of democratic consolidation in Nigeria since independence, 1960. Most research studies emphasize theories of democracy and political party and with little attention on party politics (intra-politics) and vis-à-vis democratic consolidation in Nigeria. However, the findings of the study showed that 95 % of respondents agreed that money and class were the major factors that undermined or determined the position of candidates in Nigerian election, while 90 % of respondents also agreed that the power of incumbency and godfatherism greatly determined the emergence of party’s candidates. Almost 90 % of respondents agreed that tribalism, ethnicity, nepotism and sectionalism were major factors that have caused party’s lack of internal democracy in Nigeria. The study concluded that party politics in the area of nomination, selection and elections have negative implications on democratic consolidation in Nigeria. Among other things, the study also concluded that lack of internal democracy within political parties as a limiting factor in Nigeria’s attempt to deepen democracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of group affiliation and group dispersion {{is a concept}} that is most often studied in order for political candidates to better understand {{the most efficient way to}} conduct their campaigns. While political campaigning in the United States is a very hot topic that most politicians analyze and study, the concept of group/party affiliation presents its own area of study that producers very interesting results. One tool for <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> affiliation on a large scale is agent-based modeling (ABM), a paradigm in the modeling and simulation (M&S) field perfectly suited for aggregating individual behaviors to observe large swaths of a population. For this study agent based modeling was used in order to look at a community of agents and determine what factors can affect the group/party affiliation patterns that are present. In the agent-based model that was used for this experiment many factors were present but two main factors were used to determine the results. The results of this study show that it is possible to use agent-based modeling to explore group/party affiliation and construct a model that can mimic real world events. More importantly, the model in the study allows for the results found in a smaller community to be translated into larger experiments to determine if the results will remain present on a much larger scale...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uncovers {{political}} culture in Northampton borough from 1768 - 1868 through {{the study of}} parliamentary elections. The thesis provides a comprehensive method of studying {{political culture}} at a local level. Northampton {{is an example of}} an 'open' pre-reform borough in which a large proportion of men were able to vote in parliamentary elections; pollbooks, political ephemera, newspapers and correspondence have been used to provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the borough's elections. By analysing gender and space history alongside more traditional approaches to political history such as <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> politics, politicians and pollbook analysis, this thesis shows the importance of linking various methodologies to provide a complete picture of political culture. This study argues that the home was used as a political space during pre-reform elections due to election customs and the exchange of property. It shows the involvement of non-elite women in pre-reform elections through their role as homeowners and witnessses. By testing 'new political history' this study argues that the constituency was not solely constructed by politicians, and nor did it mirror national agenda: local political rhetoric was actually of a pragmatic nature, and shifted to suit the electorate and encompass common social terminology. This thesis argues that practical changes made by reforms of parliament facilitated ideological shifts and had unintended consequences. Finally, this thesis suggests that political culture must focus on the practicalities of politics at the local level...|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Humanities, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfillment of the requirement for the degree of Master’s by Dissertation (Political Science) Johannesburg, 2014 There is {{a gap in the}} South African literature on party ideology. This thesis attempts to fill that gap by <b>examining</b> <b>party</b> ideology in South Africa and will use the left-right spectrum to measure ideology. It will do this by using quantitative and qualitative methodology by engaging in the following approach: manifesto analysis, expert survey and interviews. It looks at thirteen parties as represented in parliament at 2009, that is, the ANC, DA, COPE, IFP, FFP, ID, UDM, ACDP, UCDP, APC, AZAPO, MF, and the PAC. The ideological analysis will be categorized according to three domains: the political, socio-economic and the social-cultural; and will use an intra-domain approach to identify variables within the major ideologies and domains. The findings of this research show that there is a left-right dimension in South Africa. There are right-wing and left-wing parties. Liberalism, socialism-communism, conservatism and nationalism broadly make up the ideologies present among the parties. In the political domain, parties are predominantly centre-right based on liberal and conservative elements; in the socio-economic domain, parties are predominantly centre-left based on modern liberal or social democratic elements; and in the social-cultural domain, parties are made up of centre-right which is based on liberal and nationalist elements, and centre-left which is based on libertarian elements. The predominant ideological position {{of the majority of the}} parties does not say something about the non-predominant ideologies of the other parties. In the political domain, there is a centre-left tendency based on participatory democracy, a centre position based on liberal views in politics, and a far right tendency based on centralization. In the socio-economic domain, there is a far left position based on socialism-communism, and a far right tendency based on libertarianism. In the social-cultural domain, there is a centre-left position based on moderate liberalism, and a far right position based on conservatism. It is the argument of this thesis to consider the overall ideology but more importantly to give sufficient attention to domain and intra-domain issues. South African parties must engage more rigorously to identify their own ideological positions instead of projecting their immediate focus on adversarial politics but rather understand what vision and principles they are actually offering to South African citizens and society at large...|$|E

40|$|Election manifestos play an {{important}} role both in political practice and in political science research. Nevertheless there are only few studies which <b>examine</b> how <b>parties</b> develop election manifestos. I present an exploratory study of the preparation of the election manifestos for the German state level election in Baden-Württemberg in 2006. The empirical analysis consists firstly of interviews with key actors in the preparation process and secondly of a comparison between the manifesto proposals the party leaderships presented to the party conferences and the final versions. Based on the interview findings I introduce a stylized model of manifesto preparation. The results show that the process was comparatively similar across parties, but there were differences especially with regard to the involvement of party members prior to the party conference stage. This involvement was lower in the two large parties CDU and SPD. All <b>examined</b> <b>party</b> conferences extended the leadership’s manifesto proposal considerably. The Greens and the WASG, the two parties with the supposedly most strongly policy-oriented members, changed the original versions more strongly than the others...|$|R

40|$|A {{dominant}} assumption in {{the existing}} literature on party organisation in Western Europe holds that parties acquiesce in membership decline because modern campaigning is capital- rather than labour-intensive. This article studies eight reform attempts, from 1989 to 2011, by two paradigmatic member- ship parties, the German SPD and CDU. The <b>examined</b> <b>party</b> documents show that the two parties still value and seek mass membership. Indeed, most of the proposed reforms are not attempts at organisational innovation, but have the intention of consolidating the existing membership organisations. Surprisingly, the parties are concerned about membership decline not mainly for electoral reasons, but because they value and wish to preserve their legacy as membership organisations. Secondly, both the SPD and the CDU documents suggest that the legal-normative imperative of the German Basic Law requiring parties to sustain democratic linkage necessitates a membership organisation. Furthermore, the SPD views mass membership as inherent to social democratic ideology...|$|R

The article concludes, however, that perceptions of his weakness and ineffectiveness should be contextualised due to the following two factors: first, the constraints of inheriting an ideologically divided parliamentary Conservative party; and, second, the contrasting circumstances that ensured that his predecessor and successor appeared strong and effective, which have magnified perceptions of his weakness and ineffectiveness...|$|R
