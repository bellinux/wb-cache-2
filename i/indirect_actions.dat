500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose <b>indirect</b> <b>actions</b> contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal."

40|$|AbstractHit {{and target}} theory is widely {{known as a}} method for {{deriving}} the survival probability of a cell {{from the number of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks. Direct <b>action</b> and <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> are the way of causing DNA lesion by radiation. The object of a hit and target model is dried DNA.

5000|$|Dopaminergic means [...] "related to {{dopamine}}" [...] (literally, [...] "working on dopamine"), dopamine being {{a common}} neurotransmitter. Dopaminergic substances or actions increase dopamine-related {{activity in the}} brain. Dopaminergic brain structures facilitate dopamine-related activity. For example, certain proteins such as the dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine receptors can be classified as dopaminergic, and neurons that synthesize or contain dopamine and synapses with dopamine receptors in them may also be labeled as dopaminergic. Enzymes that regulate the biosynthesis or metabolism of dopamine such as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase or DOPA decarboxylase, monoamine oxidase (MAO), and catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) may {{be referred to as}} dopaminergic as well. Also, any endogenous or exogenous chemical substance that acts to affect dopamine receptors or dopamine release through <b>indirect</b> <b>actions</b> (for example, on neurons that synapse onto neurons that release dopamine or express dopamine receptors) can also be said to have dopaminergic effects, two prominent examples being opioids, which enhance dopamine release indirectly in the reward pathways, and some substituted amphetamines, which enhance dopamine release directly by binding to and inhibiting VMAT2.|$|E

This article offers an alternative perspective on transformation in which organizational design is viewed {{as a function of the}} way Special Operations Forces generally conduct missions. Special operations missions and tasks can broadly be categorised into direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> capabilities. Direct action capabilities are those that bring force directly into contact with the enemy.

With respect to the future transformation of Norwegian Special Operations Forces, this article claims that the current organizational structure, i. e., maintaining two separate units, should be maintained if <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> capabilities are to be emphasized and developed as a primary capability, which is not the case today. If special operations capabilities continue to focus on direct action capabilities, current organizational design is not necessarily optimal, and a merger option is therefore relevant...|$|R
