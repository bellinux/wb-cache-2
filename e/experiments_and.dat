5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate <b>experiments,</b> <b>and</b> colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> research aboard the station.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{curriculum}} of the <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> practice in the Department of Electronics and Control Engineering of Tsuyama National College of Technology is presented. Importance of the <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> practice program in technical junior college, Institute National College of Technology, is generally accepted. But {{it is very difficult}} to assemble the <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> practice subjects for the Department of Electronics and Control Engineering which is newly introduced resently, because there is little historical background and its program contains a large variety of engineering lessons. We have investigated trends of the <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> practice program in other Institute National College of Technology, and proposed an example of revised program of the <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> practice subjects for the Electronics and Control Engineering course...|$|R
5|$|During {{the later}} {{part of their}} mission in August, the crew focused on {{completing}} <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> doing research {{in the areas of}} astrophysics, life sciences, and smelting. The remainder of the crew's activities during this time consisted of unloading the newly arrived Progress cargo ship and monitoring its automated refueling of the station's core module.|$|E
5|$|<b>Experiments</b> <b>and</b> ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Experiments</b> <b>and</b> {{observations}} {{show that}} Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{distributed}} {{copies of}} the electrostatic machine to many of his close associates {{to encourage them to}} study electricity. Between 1747 and 1750, Franklin sent many letters to his friend Collinson in London about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and the Leyden jar, including his observations and theories on the principles of electricity. These letters were collected and published in 1751 in a book entitled <b>Experiments</b> <b>and</b> Observations on Electricity.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down or up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|Myers earned {{extra money}} from {{fulfilling}} requests for art work and building mechanical gadgets for others. He {{spent most of}} this money on materials for his <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> on science books. He spent his extra time in workshops and laboratories to learn scientific principles, and his spare time in the woods to learn about nature. He was a leader among his classmates and the local teenagers.|$|E

5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md. <b>Experiments</b> <b>and</b> predictions {{suggest that the}} half-lives will then decrease, apart from 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} pheasant {{is a rare}} bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation <b>experiments,</b> <b>and</b> DNA analysis to show that this pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant Lophura hatinhensis and the subspecies annamensis of the silver pheasant L. nycthemera.|$|E

5|$|The shuttle {{delivered}} {{a pair of}} solar arrays along with the Russian-built Mir Docking Module to allow docking with the station by the space shuttle without moving Mirs Kristall module. During the three-day docking, the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between Atlantis and Mir, moved several long-term <b>experiments,</b> <b>and</b> upgraded the station with new equipment, particularly during {{the installation of the}} docking module.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E
5|$|Each {{dealt with}} a {{different}} aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement <b>experiments,</b> <b>and</b> Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.|$|E
5|$|Frankenstein, MD is {{presented}} as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with cutting-edge medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves {{as an adviser to}} Frankenstein, usually acting as a foil and reminding her of the impracticality or perceived impossibility of her <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> theories.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{temperature}} distribution of four steel-concrete composite decks and one RC deck under freeze-thaw temperature by laboratory <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> finite element analysis. Differences of temperature distribution among five decks are discussed, and {{the comparison between}} <b>experiment</b> <b>and</b> analysis is made. There is a good agreement between analysis <b>and</b> <b>experiment,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is found that}} differences arise due to structural details. Furthermore, the amount of freeze-thaw in concrete is estimated for two simplified cases, and it is found that environmental conditions affect the temperature distribution inside the decks together with structural details...|$|R
