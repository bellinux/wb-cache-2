5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|York {{were beaten}} 4–1 {{at home to}} Morecambe, with Walker scoring York's only goal with a first half penalty, before {{enduring}} their largest defeat of the season after losing 4–0 away to Wycombe. Jamie Reed was loaned to Cambridge United {{for the rest of}} the season, with his opportunities in the team limited. Burton midfielder John McGrath and Aldershot striker Michael Rankine were signed on loan, with the former joining for one month and the latter {{for the rest of the}} season. Both started in York's 0–0 draw at home to Gillingham. York opened the scoring against Barnet at home through a David Stephens own goal, although goals from Andy Yiadom and Jake Hyde saw the away team win 2–1. Everson was loaned out to Gateshead for a month, having struggled for opportunities in the team, and Platt returned to Harrogate on loan for the remainder of the season. York drew 0–0 away to Oxford, with the best chance of the match falling to Blair when he <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> at goalkeeper Luke McCormick. O'Connell's loan was extended until the end of the season. Daniel Nardiello scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Rotherham when York were leading 1–0, after the away team had taken the lead through Blair earlier in the second half. Johnson was released after making seven appearances for the club, having been hindered during the season by stomach and groin problems.|$|E

Coming up toward the works, Devin's entire division, mostly dismounted, skirmished with portions of Heth's, Johnson's and Pickett's infantry. About 10:00p.m., Devin was ordered to pull back to Jetersville and he led his men to that point after burning a nearby mill.|$|E

Within {{the sight of the}} citizens of Constantinople, Krum who was also the high priest made a sacrifice to the Bulgar god Tangra, performed some pagan rituals, then the Bulgarians built trenches along the whole length of the city's walls and then suddenly Krum offered peace.|$|E

The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E
25|$|While many TV {{films of}} the 1970s were action-oriented genre {{pictures}} of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production, the small screen also saw {{a revival of the}} B melodrama.

A petition seeking to disqualify Arroyo from the race was dismissed by the Comelec for lack of merit, a decision which was later affirmed by the Supreme Court.

On not finding him there, he went to Ahuja's flat and found him there. There was a verbal confrontation between the two men; according to Nanavati's account related in court, he had asked Ahuja whether the latter intended to marry Sylvia and accept their children. After Prem replied in the negative, three shots were fired and Prem Ahuja dropped dead. Nanavati <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> to confess to the Provost Marshal of the Western Naval Command and, on his advice, turned himself over to the Deputy Commissioner of Police.|$|E

There are reports that Borg {{received}} threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.|$|E

25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E

The United States occupation of Veracruz ultimately ended and New York resumed her shakedown cruise along the East Coast of the United States. She also undertook several goodwill duties, and in December 1915 she held a high-profile Christmas party and dinner for several hundred orphans from New York City, {{at the suggestion of}} her crew.
