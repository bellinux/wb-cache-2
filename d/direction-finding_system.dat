Oversampled analog-to-digital converter architectures offer a means of exchanging resolution in time for that in amplitude and represent an attractive approach to implementing precision converters without the need for complex precision analog circuits. Using oversampling techniques based on sigma-delta modulation, a convenient tradeoff exists between sampling rate and resolution. One of the major advantages of integrated optics is the capability to efficiently couple wideband signals into the optical domain. Typically, sigma-delta processors require simple and relatively low-precision analog components and thus are well suited to integrated optical implementations.

One {{of the elements of}} IMOS is the Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network (ACORN). ACORN will have a combination of phased array and <b>direction-finding</b> <b>systems</b> to cater for the different needs of the marine research community. The data will be routed through a central laboratory for quality assurance and metadata labelling. System diagnostic data will also be sent to the central laboratory and all monitoring and maintenance will originate there.

Deployment of the radars will be in support of regional nodes where there is a range of identified questions concerned with boundary currents and associated eddies and their interactions with shelf water and topography. The first installation for the Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network is in the southern section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) on the north-east coast. The GBR radar is a phased-array WERA system operating at 8. 348 MHz and a 33 KHz bandwidth. It transmits 28 W of power in a CW chirp on a broad-beam antenna and receives on 12 short whip antennas at half-wavelength spacing along the bank {{at the back of the}} beach in a sweeping arc of a circle with a large radius of curvature. This configuration produces surface current measurements on a 4. 5 km grid scale over ranges of up to 150 km. The two radar stations operate alternately for 5 minutes, giving a map of surface currents every 10 minutes. The data volume is 115 MByte/day for the near real-time data and 1. 5 GByte/day for the raw time series for each of the two radar stations. One of the requirements of the project is to establish appropriate archiving procedures. We anticipate that the most popular data format will be the hourly maps of surface currents which can be used for operational, planning and educational purposes.

The primary objective of the HF beacon on ZACUBE 1 {{is to provide a}} continuous radio signal to calibrate and verify the elevation-resolving algorithm of the SuperDARN HF Radar antenna at SANAE IV in Antarctica. The signal will also be used to characterise the beam pattern of this and other HF radar antennas in the SuperDARN network, and to characterise the ionosphere over the Earthâ€™s polar region. A secondary objective of the HF beacon on the satellite is to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) by using either measurements of the carrier phase delays or of the Faraday rotation of the signal. An orbit analysis was done for the CubeSat using parameters for an orbit at an altitude of 600 km and inclination angles of 97. 8 Â° and 65 Â°. To account for the propagation effects of the radio wave at 14. 099 MHz, the IRI- 2007 model and the Chapman layer model were used to define the ionosphere. A ray tracing algorithm written in MATLAB was used to simulate the ray paths. To evaluate the results, a documented ray tracing algorithm known as Haselgrove ray tracing was used. The results obtained show that for an orbit at an inclination above 70 Â° and altitude of 600 km, a number of rays actually traverse the ionosphere and reach the receivers during most of the year for a sufficient period of time during every pass. The least refraction is experienced during winter, therefore it is the best time for the calibration of the radar antenna.

40|$|A <b>direction-finding</b> <b>system</b> with {{multiple}} direction finders (DFs) {{is a military}} intelligence system designed to detect the positions of transmitters of radio frequencies. This dissertation studies three decision {{problems associated with the}} <b>direction-finding</b> <b>system.</b> The first part of this dissertation is to prescribe DF deployment to maximize the effectiveness with which transmitter positions are estimated in an area of interest (AOI). Three methods are presented to prescribe DF deployment. The first method uses Stansfield?s probability density function to compute objective function coefficients numerically. The second and the third employ surrogate measures of effectiveness as objective functions. The second method, like the first, involves complete enumerations; the third formulates the problem as an integer program and solves it with an efficient network-based label-setting algorithm. Our results show that the third method, which involved use of a surrogate measure as an objective function and an exact label-setting algorithm, is most effective. The second part of this dissertation is to minimize the number of DFs to cover an AOI effectively, considering obstacles between DFs and transmitters. We formulate this problem as a partial set multicover problem in which at least -fraction of the likely transmitter positions must be covered, each by at least direction finders. We present greedy heuristics with random selection rules for the partial set multicover problem, estimating statistical bounds on unknown optimal values. Our results show that the greedy heuristic with column selection rule, which gives priority for selecting a column that advances more rows to k-coverage, performs best on the partial set multicover problems. Results also show that the heuristic with random row and column selection rules is the best of the heuristics with respect to statistical bounds. The third part of this dissertation deals with the problem of deploying direction finders with the goal of maximizing the effectiveness with which transmitter positions can be estimated in an AOI while hedging against enemy threats. We present four formulations, considering the probability that a direction finder deployed at a location will survive enemy threats over the planning horizon (i. e., not be rendered inoperative by an attack). We formulate the first two as network flow problems and present an efficient label-setting algorithm. The third and the fourth use the well-known Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) risk measure to deal with the risk of being rendered inoperative by the enemy. Computational results show that risk-averse decision models tend to deploy some or all DFs in locations that are not close to the enemy to reduce risk.

As the need for ADCs with faster conversion speeds and lower power dissipation increases, {{there is a growing}} motivation {{to reduce the number of}} power-consuming components by employing folding circuits to fold the input analog signal symmetrically prior to quantization by high-speed comparators. These properties of low-power consumption, compactness, high-resolution and fast conversion speeds make folding ADCs an attractive concept to be used for defense applications, such as unmanned <b>systems,</b> <b>direction-finding</b> antenna architectures and system-on-a-chip applications. In this thesis, a prototype of an optical folding ADC was implemented using the Robust Symmetrical Number System (RSNS).

This thesis focuses on the simulation and hardware implementation of this ADC architecture, including the bank of comparators and the RSNS-to-Binary Conversion within a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), to achieve an eight-bit dynamic range of 133.

From this background a particular <b>direction-finding</b> <b>system</b> suitable for shipboard use is detailed. Use of three {{modes of operation}} of the defined system is shown to provide through 360 ° coarse and find indications of the bearings of each of several stations transmitting simultaneously. It is also shown that this system will provide measures of amplitude and, with some added circuitry, frequency {{of each of these}} received signals. It is shown that the gain characteristics of the antennas for each mode of operation are chosen in a manner which makes the parallel-channel receiving system immune to signals reflected from the ship and its rigging. Two different methods of obtaining independent measures of signal frequency and bearing are presented. A brief history of direction finding and an extensive bibliography are provided.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} {{to suggest that the}} f{hook} 0 Es value tends to be high at positions in the Es-layer where trough slope-lines and crest slope-lines of F 2 -layer irregularities meet the Es-layer. These slope-lines are drawn through the troughs and crests, respectively, of the characteristic kinks in the F 2 -layer ionization contours, which are associated with F 2 -layer irregularities. A rotating-loop <b>direction-finding</b> <b>system</b> has allowed an estimation of the distribution of ionization, which gives rise to Sporadic-E echoes. Analysis of Sporadic-E occurrence, on two occasions, suggests that the reflecting surfaces are frontal in nature, the fronts having a separation from each other of some tens of kilometres, and probably existing as closed curves, with diameters of the order of several hundreds of kilometres. A possible association between these structures and the occurrence of the green line of the airglow, is discussed. A distribution of ionization, which will give contours showing "clouds" of ionization at some frequencies and a ripple structure at other frequencies, is proposed, in an endeavour to explain the apparent dual nature of Sporadic-E occurrence. The evidence seems to indicate that the mechanism operating at the Es-layer level, producing the phenomenon of Sporadic-E, is the same as that which produces the F 2 -layer irregularities which are responsible for "Spread-F"...|$|E
