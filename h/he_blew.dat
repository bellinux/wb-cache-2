5|$|On September 1, Mota was {{the winning}} pitcher when he pitched a {{scoreless}} inning in an 8–7 victory over Houston. He got another win by pitching a scoreless inning on September 12 in a 6–4 victory over Florida. With the Mets, {{he had a}} 3–0 record with a 1.00 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 18 games to finish the season 4–3 with a 4.53 ERA in 52 games. He made {{the playoffs for the}} first time in his career as the Mets won the NL East. In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> a 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two scoreless innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared in five of the seven games in the series. <b>He</b> <b>blew</b> a lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not give up a run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E
60|$|Last {{came the}} turn of the third fairy. 'This one has a horn slung round him. When <b>he</b> <b>blows</b> at the small end the seas shall be covered with ships.

5|$|Prior to the 2004 season, {{with a year}} {{remaining}} on his contract, Rivera signed a two-year extension worth $21million, with an option for a third year. That season, Rivera surpassed 300career saves and made his sixth All-Star team with 32saves at the midseason break, then an AL record. His final numbers for the year included a 1.94ERA and a career-high 53saves in 57opportunities; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves. Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting. Following the Yankees' victory in the 2004 AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins, Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives {{who had died in}} an accident in his swimming pool. Despite his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day. He recorded a save that night, as well as in Game 2. Although the Yankees led three-games-to-none in the series, Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5, and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination. In Game 4, Boston's Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera, eventually scoring on a single to tie the game. In Game 5, Rivera entered with a one-run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score. Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason, <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> three of five save opportunities in the two series. Boston's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best-of-seven series in which they trailed three-games-to-none.|$|E
5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre {{said that he would}} try to reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped early in the second half; over one stretch, <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had {{one of the most memorable}} postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E

25|$|American {{officials}} assumed {{already in}} 2012 that Qaidat al-Jihad (a.k.a.

25|$|One recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} suicide bombs carried by children. Unlike most suicide bombings, the use of these not only earned condemnation from the United States and from human rights groups such as Amnesty International, but also from many Palestinians and much of the Middle East press.

25|$|Harvick {{then went}} on to collect four {{straight}} Top 10 finishes at Daytona, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Indianapolis. Upon returning to Pocono, his day ended quickly as <b>he</b> <b>blew</b> an engine just 20 laps into the race. He ended up in the 42nd position. It was his first DNF since the previous year's Duck Commander 500 at Texas. He nearly won the Cheez-It 355 at Watkins Glen, but ran out of gas on the last corner. This allowed Joey Logano, who was second at the time, to win the race. Harvick was able to cross the finish line, scoring a third-place finish. He {{then went on}} to finish second in the Pure Michigan 400 the following week, and at the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol as well. During Labor Day Weekend at Darlington in the Bojangles' Southern 500, he finished fifth after leading 44 laps. The first race of the Chase took place at Chicagoland. Harvick finished 42nd after getting a flat tire and spinning into the wall due to contact with Jimmie Johnson a few laps earlier on a restart. A confrontation did take place, after Harvick met with Johnson and punched him in the chest. Harvick dominated next week at Loudon, leading 216 of 300 laps. However, he ran out of gas, allowing Matt Kenseth to win. Harvick finished 21st, putting him in danger of being eliminated from the Chase. The following week at Dover International Speedway, Harvick dominated a majority of the race to earn third win of the season, leading 351 of 400 laps in the process. That win allowed Harvick to clinch a spot into the next round of the Chase, after narrowly avoiding being eliminated.|$|E
