[...] According to this account, [...] Geary's party rode through Amwell Township toward Flemington to verify that a supply of salt beef and pork was ready for the army to pick up.

[...] When Geary's company rode by, the militia fired a volley of musket fire, killing Geary. [...] A more brief description by a non-participating British officer reporting the event indicated that Geary was alerted to the impending fire, but was unable to escape the volley. [...] The dragoons returned fire, but were driven off by continuing militia fire.|$|E

For example, it is speculated that the jussive -u is from the Hebrew imperative -û, but it could also be from the Greek [...] imperative of <b>deponent</b> verbs such as dekhou (receive!); or perhaps it was inspired by [...] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial -e is found in Latin and Italian (bene) as well as in Russian (after a palatalized consonant); the participle bases -t- and -nt- are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base -i is found in Italian (-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli for Esperanto mi, ci, vi, si, li) and English (me, we, he, she).|$|E

40|$|Latin <b>deponents</b> {{are usually}} treated as {{morphological}} idiosyncrasies {{in which the}} Middle morphology {{is not related to}} an anticausative (change of state), reflexive or passive syntactic structure, in which it would be expected and grammatically justified (Embick, David. 2000. Features syntax and categories in the Latin perfect. Linguistic Inquiry 31 (2). 185 – 230; Xu, Zheng, Mark Aronoff and Frank Anshen. 2007. Deponency in Latin. In Matthew Baerman et[*]al. (eds.), Deponency and morphological mismatches, 127 – 144. Oxford: Oxford University Press). Focusing on the non-denominal <b>deponents,</b> I show that these verbs are always reflexives or anticausatives. In the reflexive and anticausative structures a single argument gains two thematic roles, the most external one, doer for the reflexives, undergoer for the anticausatives, and a lower one (holder of a state, benefactive, etc.). The Latin Middle morphology marks the external role as syntactically deactivated but semantically existential and allows for the assignment of the external role to a lower argument. The peculiarity of <b>deponents</b> is not the presence of the Middle, but the fact that, because of specific lexical constraints, these verbs cannot be present in an Active derivation. Similar lexically constrained verbs which can only appear in anticausative or reflexive structures are crosslinguistically attested: <b>deponents</b> are not Latin idiosyncrasies...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, {{a notice}} {{to a party}} <b>deponent</b> (a person called to testify in a deposition) may be {{accompanied}} by a request for production of documents and other tangible things during the taking of a deposition. The notice to produce (literally: [...] "bring these documents with you to the deposition") is served prior to the deposition. This follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The method of using a subpoena duces tecum is generally valid only to compel a witness to produce documents and other things {{at the time of the}} deposition. If a <b>deponent</b> is a non-party to the action (not involved directly in the litigation, but wanted for testimony), production of documents can be compelled only through a proper subpoena duces tecum. Depending on the nature of the documents, and their volume, some may be obtained directly, and before deposition under FRCP 34. In cases where a large number of documents are potentially relevant to the hearing, the court may order them to be produced prior to the deposition. This forms a part of legal discovery and allows parties involved time to review them prior to the deposition or other hearing.|$|E

2500|$|In this Western tradition, {{physicians}} {{are considered to}} be members of a learned profession, and enjoy high social status, often combined with expectations of a high and stable income and job security. However, medical practitioners often work long and inflexible hours, with shifts at unsociable times. Their high status is partly from their extensive training requirements, and also because of their occupation's special ethical and legal duties. The term traditionally used by physicians to describe a person seeking their help is the word patient (although one who visits a physician for a routine check-up may also be so described). This word [...] is an ancient reminder of medical duty, as it originally meant 'one who suffers'. The English noun comes from the Latin word patiens, the present participle of the <b>deponent</b> verb, , meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb πάσχειν (= paskhein, to suffer) and its cognate noun [...] (= [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Fernós was {{concerned}} that this would dilate the process, especially since he thought that Congress was unlikely to offer a compromise {{in a process that}} would include the consideration of statehood. Muñoz then suggested that they went directly to a plesbicite that only considered independence, statehood and a generic [...] "Commonwealth". On August 16, 1962, PdC No. 616 which adopted the governor's idea was presented in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Fernós criticized the fact that the bill lacked the elements of the development that they had proposed towards a sovereign association; the referendum had been turned into a straw poll. This presented a notable contrast to what had been accorded with the Kennedy administration. After the project went to public hearings, Hiram Torres Rigual and Juan Manuel García Passalacqua presented Muñoz with an analysis of the <b>deponent</b> arguments which focused on the recognition of the sovereignty and the opposition to the presidential vote. Despite his disdain towards the way that the issue was being attended, Fernós attempted to harmonize the local and federal processes. This bill was eventually removed and replaced with another. Parallel to this, the members of the informal Commission continued their research for a bill that developed the current status.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{publisher}} of the Virginia Gazette had died. When it became clear in the spring of 1766 that the Stamp Act {{was not going to be}} enforced, two printers set up shops in Williamsburg. Both papers thrived in the ensuing controversies. On July 4, Judge Blair explained in a published letter that the judges had relied upon assurances of [...] "three eminent Lawyers" [...] that they could grant Chiswell bail, as well as two depositions that Routledge had run himself on Chiswell's sword, while stressing that the high bail of 6,000 pounds sterling could be recovered should Chiswell fail to show for trial. In response, 'Dikephilos' wrote that his own investigation agreed that Routledge had been drunk, but Chiswell was not, and further that neither <b>deponent</b> favoring Chiswell had witnessed the brawl. He predicted popular violence if the trial unfairly favored the aristocratic defendant. More published letters followed. On August 1, Wythe identified himself in print as one of the consulted lawyers and said his opinion had been limited to the legal bail issue. After Chiswell returned to Williamsburg in September, his attorney John Wayles published the two depositions given to the judges, which proved to be from Wayles himself and the Cumberland undersheriff. Judge Blair was furious when Wayles added a detail to the published copy of his own deposition (which he had gotten from the court records), apparently in order to track the undersheriff's deposition. Judge Byrd, on the other hand, joined with Wayles to demand a libel indictment against Col. Robert Bolling, Jr., claiming Bolling wrote the anonymous criticism of the bailment published on July 11. The grand jury refused, issuing a no-bill instead. However, Wythe's sterling reputation may have been tarnished. When the assembly reconvened, Robert Carter Nicholas was appointed treasurer, Peyton Randolph became speaker, and his brother John Randolph became king's attorney general, a post to which Wythe had aspired. Chiswell died unexpectedly in his Williamsburg home on October 15, before his trial could begin. Jefferson decades later in his Kentucky Resolution echoed the anonymous 'Virginia Gazette' writer of September 12, 1766, who stated, [...] "Distrust, the parent of security, is a political virtue of unspeakable utility." ...|$|E

and that after her marriage, she having one day taken it off her finger, he saw upon the inside of it a stamp, but what that stamp is he does not know. And being interrogate, Depones, That he had a suspicion that this ring was Serjeant Davies's ring, having heard it reported in the country that Serjeant Davies had such a ring upon his finger when he was murdered, but does not remember his having told his suspicion to any body; and being further interrogate, depones, That since the panel Duncan's imprisonment, the <b>deponent</b> was solicited by Donald Clerk, the panel Duncan's brother, to conceal what he knew when he came to give evidence; but this was after his having first solicited the <b>deponent</b> to leave the country, that he might not give evidence, and upon the deponent's saying he offered him nothing to leave the country with; but then it was that Donald proposed his not giving true evidence, adding, that of every penny Donald was worth, the <b>deponent</b> should have the half; and being interrogate, at the desire of the Jury, if ever he had asked payment of the twenty pounds contained in the above-mentioned paper produced by him, Depones, That he once did, shortly after the term of payment, to which Duncan answered, that it would be as well to let it ly in his hands, to which he was satisfied, and that he never asked payment of the annual rent; and being further interrogate, Depones, that before the <b>deponent</b> went home to the panel's service at Martinmas one thousand seven hundred and fifty, it was well known and reported in the country that the bones of the dead body found upon the above mentioned hill had been buried by the <b>deponent</b> and Donald Farquharson, as also was the story of the vision or apparition whereof the <b>deponent</b> had told Donald Farquharson; and being interrogate for the panel, Depones, that he not only told the story of the vision or apparition to Donald Farquharson, as above mentioned, but that he also told it to John Growar and Daldownie before he mentioned it to Donald Farquharson: Depones, That there were folks living with him at the sheilling the time the vision appeared to him as above, but that he told it to none of them; and adds, that Isobel M'Hardie, in Inveray, a woman then in the sheilling with him, has told him since, that she saw such a vision as the <b>deponent</b> has above described, and has told him herself so much; and upon the panel's interrogatory, depones, that upon the vision's appearing to him, it described the place where he would find the bones so exactly, that he went within a yard of the place where they lay upon his first going out: And this is the truth, as he shall answer to God; and depones he cannot write.|$|E
