City Steps is a 5 -year {{community-based}} partici-patory research walking intervention {{designed to}} help lower blood pressure in a majority African American population in southern Mississippi via community col-laboration and capacity building, increased walking, culturally tailored health education sessions, and moti-vational interviewing. Building community capacity for physical activity is {{a key component of}} this interven-tion. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been used to assess how project stakeholders perceive the community capacity-building efforts of the project. This article illustrates the baseline results of this mixed methods approach from the perspective of three groups of stakeholders: project researchers and staff, commu-nity advisory board, and intervention walking coaches. Eight constructs were examined, including leadership, resources, <b>external</b> networking, <b>visibility</b> and recogni-tion, personnel sustainability, ability and commitment to organize, communication with community members, and relationships with influential others. Quantitative results indicated significant differences among stake-holder groups for project leadership and personnel sustainability.

40|$|Image-based CSG {{rendering}} algorithms {{for standard}} graphics hardware rely on multipass rendering that includes {{reading and writing}} large amounts of pixel data from and to the frame buffer. Since the performance of this data path has hardly improved over the last years, we describe new implementation techniques that efficiently use modern graphics hardware. 1) The render-to-texture ability is used to temporarily store shape visibility, avoiding the expensive copy of z-buffer content to <b>external</b> memory. Shape <b>visibility</b> is encoded discretely instead of using depth values. Hence, the technique is also not susceptible to artifacts in contrast to previously described methods. 2) We present an image-based technique for calculating the depth complexity of a CSG shape that avoids reading and analyzing pixel data from the frame buffer. Both techniques optimize various CSG rendering algorithms, namely the Goldfeather and the layered Goldfeather algorithm, and the Sequenced-Convex- Subtraction (SCS) algorithm. This way, these image-based CSG algorithms now operate accelerated by graphics hardware and, therefore, represent a significant improvement towards real-time image-based CSG rendering for complex models...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{traffic safety}} and {{capacity}} raise enormous attention nowadays, especially in ports and inland waterways with {{high traffic density}} and restricted waterway geometry. However, {{a limited number of}} factors is considered in existing maritime models. Especially influences of <b>external</b> factors (wind, <b>visibility</b> and current), vessel encounters and human factors on vessel behavior (speed, course and lateral position) have not been investigated. In order to provide insight into vessel behavior {{for the development of a}} new maritime traffic model, possible impacts from current and vessel encounters are investigated using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. In this paper, equidistant cross sections approximately perpendicular to the navigation direction are used to extract vessel speed, course and position from AIS data. These vessel behavior data together with corresponding data on external conditions, including wind, visibility and current from the Port of Rotterdam, form the basic data set of this analysis. Vessel behavior under weak external influences is defined as unhindered (or reference) behavior. Vessel behavior under strong current is compared to unhindered behavior to investigate the influence of current. In addition, encounters including overtaking and head-on, are investigated to study the influence of other vessels. Statistical analysis is carried out to investigate changing of vessel speed and lateral position during encounters. Analysis results show that current only has impact on vessel speed. Both vessels involved in overtaking change their speeds and deviate in lateral direction to avoid collision. However, vessels only laterally deviate without speed changing in head-on cases.

40|$|Maritime {{traffic safety}} and port {{capacity}} is increasingly important nowadays. Due to the fast development of vessel traffic in ports and waterways, {{a lot of}} {{attention has been paid to}} maritime traffic safety and port capacity. Many simulation models have been used to predict traffic safety and port capacity m ports and waterways. However, maritime traffic models only consider few aspects, as the influences of human behavior and external factors have not been included regarding maritime traffic safety. To investigate the vessel behavior and external influencing factors, an analysis has been performed based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data under various external conditions. The study area includes a junction and a slight bend with high maritime traffic density within the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Vessels are classified m different categories based on their type and gross tonnage. Equidistant cross-sections approximately perpendicular to the navigation direction are used for investigation of vessel behavior, including speed, course and path for each vessel category. The influences of <b>external</b> factors (wind, <b>visibility</b> and current) on vessel behavior are identified by comparmg with unhindered vessel behavior. In the analysis, specific thresholds are set to select external conditions and eliminate the influence of encounters. The analysis of unhindered vessel behavior for each vessel category provides insight into vessel behavior. The results revealed that the wind has influence on vessel path, the visibility can affect vessel speed and path, and the current can influence vessel speed.

The focus of all products is on installation, use and maintenance simplicity, richness of value-adding services, economical affordability and use of effective marketing strategies in order to reach the maximum diffusion of the system. The major achievement in those issues is a software that can be installed in a simple pc in few minutes by any non-specialised, non-tutored person, and that can then be managed by "normal", technically unlearned people, as for any common pc software. The time needed to configurate the system and actually create the archive depends on the complexity of the archive, and can vary from a few minutes to some hours. A detailed and quite innovating business model is being applied to the products, with the aim of sustaining and propelling the project by business revenues.

50|$|As an academic, Ayo Ogunsheye wrote {{often on}} the need to tilt {{education}} towards improving national consciousness and bringing the informal education sector into public consciousness. In 1959, when the clamor for independence was at it loudest, a conference was held at Ibadan to hash out impending independent issues. As chairman of the first of such seminar in the region, the international conference discussed 'representative government and Progress in West Africa'. Most of his views about self-government emphasized the need to ensure internal cohesion in order to improve the standard of living of citizens. Using the adage, a nation divided against itself cannot stand, he stressed the extradition of internal chaos by the use of an appropriate constitution, which would become a necessary factor for strengthening the country, However, like his views on education, a lot them dealt with nationalism and how to ensure dynamic progress for black Africa. He also emphasized major complementary cases for unity in West Africa and Nigeria. That Nigeria as a large and diverse nation will provide instances where regions can benefit from fair exchange of food and resources. The need to attract foreign capital will become closer to reality with the existence of a large country suitable for foreign investors.
