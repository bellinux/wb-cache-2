500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good to see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Erotica is {{a concept}} album about sex and romance, on which she {{incorporated}} an alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Musically, it is a pop and dance record which incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album played on innuendos and double entendres instead of explicit words. [...] "Erotica" [...] is the opening track from the album. Starting with Madonna saying [...] "My name is Dita", she invites her lover to be passive, while she tells him to [...] "do as I say" [...] and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. It deals with sex hang-ups, and {{has been described as}} [...] "an ode to S". Her cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] follows the title track. It is described as a [...] "sassy, house-style remake" [...] of the pop standard. The third track, [...] "Bye Bye Baby," [...] starts with the declaration, [...] "This is not a love song," [...] and goes on to ask questions of a lover she is about to abandon. At one point, Madonna asks angrily: [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> good to see me cry?" [...] The fourth track from Erotica, [...] "Deeper and Deeper," [...] is described as one of the [...] "pure disco" [...] moments of the album. Its bridge features a flamenco guitar, and its lyrics talk about sexual obsession.|$|E
