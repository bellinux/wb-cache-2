5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores,</b> in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Charley turned eastward {{and then}} east-northeastward while {{tracking}} over decreasing sea surface temperatures (SST's). Early on September 27, Charley was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, Charley crossed over Terceira Island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores</b> with winds of 65mph (100km/h). Charley gradually lost tropical characteristics, and by 1800UTC on September 27, it had transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnant system accelerated northeastward toward the British Isles, where it merged with another extratropical low on September 29. While {{passing through the}} Azores, Charley produced tropical storm force winds, with the Lajes AFB reporting sustained winds of 53mph (85km/h) and gusts reaching 82mph (132km/h). No other effects from Charley were reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emmy passed within 135miles (215km) of the Lesser Antilles, {{though only}} minor effects were experienced.

5|$|When Bonnie {{passed over}} the Azores only four days after Charley, it {{resulted}} in tropical storm-force winds {{across much of the}} island chain.

5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways {{was in the}} process of buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores</b> archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E

5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of an}} upper-level low {{just west}} of the Canary Islands on September28. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460mi, 740km) southwest of São Miguel Island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores.</b> Early on October4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Upon her commissioning, Hannover {{joined the}} II Battle Squadron. From May to June 1908, Hannover {{took part in}} {{maneuvers}} in the North Sea.

The annual autumn exercises began in September; after these were completed Hannover {{was transferred to the}} I Squadron, where she served as the flagship for two years. In November, fleet and unit exercises were conducted in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores</b> reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores,</b> where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tanya was not {{considered}} a threat to land, as it did not move through the Azores while a tropical cyclone. The Azores were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores</b> were around 105mph (170km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores.</b> However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E

5|$|One week later, Hertha began a seven-month {{training}} cruise (15 August 1913 – 12 March 1914). The voyage took Lindemann to Dartmouth in England, Vilagarcía de Arousa in Spain, Faial Island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores</b> {{and as far}} as Halifax in Nova Scotia. The {{return trip}} then went via Vera Cruz in Mexico, Havana in Cuba, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Kingston in Jamaica, Port of Spain in Trinidad and then to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Spanish mainland, arriving back in Germany in the middle of March 1914, first in Brunsbüttel and two days later in Kiel. Lindemann was promoted to Fähnrich zur See (Ensign) on 3 April 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced light {{rainfall and}} winds throughout the northern Lesser Antilles. The passage of Erika brought {{a cloud of}} ash to Antigua from the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat, a rare occurrence. Strong waves from the hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern Puerto Rico, and also killed two surfers. Moderate wind gusts in Puerto Rico left thousands without power, and the hurricane resulted in $10million in damage to the Caribbean territory of the United States. Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Azores.</b> Later in its duration, the storm brought hurricane-force wind gusts and rainfall to the Azores, though no damage was reported. Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in the months of August and September, the first such occurrence in a hurricane season since 1929.|$|E
