40|$|Eco-certification {{is widely}} {{perceived}} to be an increasingly important strategy to improve the environmental performance of agriculture {{in an era of}} global trade integration and apparent weakening of regulatory capacity of nation-states. Few analyses have sought to determine whether ecolabeled products are produced in a manner that conserves natural resources and mitigates risks to ecological integrity. The authors report on a 2003 audit of farming practices in banana production in Ecuador. They find that certified farms significantly outperform noncertified farms on all <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> In many cases, noncertified farms are out of compliance with Ecuadorian environmental law. Thus, there is evidence to support claims that ecocertified products pose relatively lower ecological risks. In evaluating limitations of their study, the authors note a need to develop longitudinal data sets to assess if and how certification motivates behavioral change at the level of production.

40|$|What is {{it about}} home-making that it should touch us when it's lowly and repel us when it is sumptuous? A simple, cosy cottage may be a potent image of home, {{but when it comes}} to the design and {{construction}} of affordable suburban housing, homeliness and place-making are often far from the agenda. Affordable housing developments tend to be cheaply built, isolated, lacking in infrastructure and services, and designed with little attempt to listen to community needs or foster senses of place. The establishment of pressing sustainability concerns in the 1987 Bruntland Report for the United Nations and more recently the 2007 Stern Review" for the United Kingdom Treasury has put pressure on governments to take action. Sustainability guidelines, however, have tended to focus on quantifiable <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria,</b> and to give little consideration to place-making activities. Focusing on affordable housing in Australian suburbs, we will argue that the notion of sustainability should be broadened beyond environmental concerns, to incorporate the everyday practices of people - the livable, lived-in dimension of space...|$|R
40|$|Concrete structures’ {{service life}} lasts decades. In order {{to deal with}} all the {{probable}} degradations and deteriorations in the whole life span, the concept of concrete structures’ Life-Cycle Design was introduced into China in the 1980 s. However, until this day, Life-Cycle Design is still more of a concept to most structure designers and engineers, rather than a practical method. This paper provides a hierarchical method for concrete structures’ Life-Cycle Design, in which the design process is divided into five levels. Safety should be the fundamental requirements for all concrete structures, so as to guarantee a reliable quality. For structures located in severe environments, durability design is necessary so as to ensure the designed service life. Further, when specific economic requirements are set for concrete structures, life-cycle cost (LCC) should be considered carefully in selecting the optimal scheme. Besides, those concrete structures designed to be environmental-friendly should also take into account the specific <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> Nowadays, user-friendly schemes have attracted increasing attention too; therefore, customers’ demands should also be fully involved in the design process. Considering all the design levels mentioned above, diverse designing criteria are provided accordingly.

Only vapour compression machines are considered. A {{summary of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> such as ozone depletion potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP, HGWP) and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) is given for the most popular derivatives of methane, ethane and propane. The total equivalent warming impact (TWEI, LEWI) of refrigerating machines is discussed for a few examples, when refrigerant leakage and CO_ 2 emissions due to the electrical power consumption are considered. It is shown how the filling quantity of the refrigerant in heat pumps effects the heating capacity. The choice of the appropriate refrigerant for the desired application range depends on many factors. The vapour pressure, the pressure ratio, the coefficient of performance, the temperature after compression, the volumetric cooling or heating capacity have a determining influence {{on the use of}} a defined refrigerant. The subcooling of the condensate and the superheating of the vapour have also influence on the coefficient of performance and the volumetric cooling or heating capacity.

An EU directive for human pharmaceuticals explicitly requires that {{all member states}} should establish collection systems for unused or expired medicines. Such systems were already in use in several member states {{at the time the}} legislation went into action in 2004. Nevertheless, the disposal regulations in the EU member states are still rather different, ranging from recommendations to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste that goes nearly completely to incineration (Germany) [...] with temperatures usually between 900 °C - 1.300 °C [...] to collection systems where leftovers are considered to be “hazardous waste” (Luxembourg). In France, the Cyclamed take-back program enables people to bring back unused or expired pharmaceuticals back to the pharmacies. Nevertheless, wrong disposal via sink or toilet and hereby to the wastewater system still seems to be a problem in many EU member states: investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink. This is one of the aspects considered in the above-mentioned EU strategic approaches.Moreover, regarding the market authorization for pharmaceuticals approved for marketing in the EU before 2006 the <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria</b> have been different.

By 2020 thanks to the European Community and the Mayors agreement in 2008, cities aiming to be smart (for energy management,transport, digital technologies, social policy) will focus on sustainable development, by innovations and adequate partners. The general goal of resource saving and use of renewable energy has become a strategic necessity, fully involving architecture, whose environmental load in industrialized countries has become unsustainable. The national regulatory framework is constantly evolving, because the new European Directive 31 / 2010 /CE, repealing the E. D. 91 / 2002 /CE, obliges from January 2021 energy consumption close to zero for all new buildings. Objectives can only be achieved with the contribution of all actors of the building process and the use of effective tools for management and control of environmental quality, associated with the construction activity. Within this framework planning and building tools are essential, whose regulatory strategies are also activated at the regional scale. In Italy, many regions have begun to address the problem, for which there is a wide range of regional regulations and building regulation (R. E.) where sustainability criteria were introduced, assigning volume premiums or economic incentives, aimed at promoting the reduction of energy consumption.

Spatial and seasonal variations in a battery of seven biomarkers were analyzed in relation to environmental parameters (temperature, salinity and pH), physiological status (condition and gonad indexes), stress on stress (SoS) and chemical contaminant levels (heavy metals, PAHs and PCBs) in digestive glands. Integrated Biological Response (IBR) was calculated using seven biomarkers (AChE, BPH, MXR, GST, CAT, MDA and MT). Seasonal variations in biological response were determined during a critical period between spring and summer at two sites, where chemical contamination varies {{by a factor of}} 2 for heavy metals and a factor 2. 5 for PAHs. The analysis of a battery of biomarkers was combined with the measurement of physiological parameters at both sites, in order to quantify a maximum range of metabolic regulation with a temperature increase of 11 °C between May and August. According to our results, the MT, MDA, CAT and AChE biomarkers showed the highest amplitude during the 11 °C rise, while the BPH, GST, and MXR biomarkers showed the lowest amplitude. Metabolic amplitude measured with the IBR at Menzel Abdelrahmen - the most severely contaminated station - revealed the highest metabolic stress in Bizerte lagoon in August, when temperatures were highest 29. 1 °C. This high metabolic rate was quantified for each biomarker in the North African lagoon area and confirmed in August, when the highest IBR index values were obtained at the least-contaminated Site 2 (IBR= 9, 6) and the most-contaminated site 1 (IBR= 19, 6). The combined effects of chemical contamination and increased and salinity temperatures in summer appear to induce a highest metabolic adaptation response and can therefore be used to determine thresholds of effectiveness and facilitate the interpretation of monitoring biomarkers.

DOI: [URL] assessment is now an internationally accepted methodology for evaluating the effects of proposed major transport infrastructure projects on the environment. Within the UK, both the Channel Tunnel and the proposed high-speed rail link project have a statutory requirement to produce an <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> of the immediate and long-term effects of construction and operation.

The results confirm that methods currently used in strategic <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> are not sufficiently rewarding and provide technical and methodological challenge for experts working on their development. Solving the problem requires the development of more innovative and effective methods of evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} results from {{research into the}} perspectives on <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments</b> of Canadian indigenous peoples, in particular British Columbia's West Moberly First Nations, the Halfway River First Nation, and the Treaty 8 Tribal Association. This collaborative project interviewed First Nation government officials and staff as well as community members to determine their analyses of what worked and, more significantly, what did not work in engaging and consulting indigenous people. This research identified significant failings in Canadian and British Columbia <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> processes, including substantive procedural failures, relational failures between First Nation, provincial and federal governments, and fundamental philosophical differences between assessment processes and indigenous worldviews. Based upon their review of <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> failings, the collaborating First Nations recommend a fundamental revision of <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> processes so as to protect into the future their Treaty and Aboriginal rights and to ensure their survival as distinct and viable cultures upon the land.

40|$|The lack {{of early}} {{integration}} with {{the planning and}} decision-making process {{has been a major}} problem in <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment.</b> Traditional project-based <b>environmental</b> impact <b>assessment</b> has inadequate incentives and capacities to incorporate critical environmental impacts at a broader temporal or spatial scale. While many applications have been geared towards implementing project-level <b>environmental</b> <b>assessments,</b> comparatively little research has been done to determine how to incorporate strategically critical environmental impacts into local comprehensive land use planning. Although the principles of strategic <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> (SEA) are not yet required in local comprehensive land use planning in the United States, these principles create a theoretical framework for local <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment.</b> This study builds a theoretical framework for more effectively integrating the principles of strategic <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> into local comprehensive land use plans. The empirical case study results indicate that California local jurisdictions did not fully integrated the SEA principles into their local plans.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{contamination}} of soils has increased worldwide and bioremediation offers an attractive and environmentally friendly {{solution to this}} problem. However, the efficiency and completion of remediation must be assessed using <b>environmental</b> risk <b>assessment</b> <b>criteria.</b> As a result, a variety of indicators have become essential for determining and evaluating recovery of contaminated soils. In this study, microbiological and toxicological assays are used to support traditional chemical analyses, to identify a suite of assays suitable for determining a Soil Recovery Index from Pollution (SRIP). Microbiological assays used are microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), plate counts for culturable degraders and general heterotrophs enzyme activities (dehydrogenase and phosphatase), basal respiration, Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR), and bacterial biosensor. Toxicological response assays of higher organisms include two species of earthworms (Eisenia fetida and Lumbricus terrestris), also, plant assays, including seed germination, root elongation, germination index and plant shoot height performed using two species of plant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white mustard (Brassica alba L.). All assays were applied sequentially to kerosene and diesel amended soils for both incubated and non–incubated treatments. The indicators were discriminated {{in terms of their}} sensitivity using a ranking system. The data collected were integrated into a single numeric value to reflect a ‘level of concern’ for each soil treatment. Soil characteristics and hydrocarbon types play key roles in the response of these indicators. The soil that had high organic matter and clay content was less affected by hydrocarbons. For the freshly hydrocarbon amended soils, kerosene was more toxic than diesel, however the opposite was found in the incubated hydrocarbon amended treatments. The most sensitive and robust indicators were basal respiration, bacterial heterotrophs and degraders counts, bacterial biosensors (methanol extracted soils), earthworm survival, mustard root elongation and mustard plant shoot height. Sensitive indicators were inserted into the SRIP. The SRIP indicates the “level of concern” for each soil treatment in a single value. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
