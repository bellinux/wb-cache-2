25|$|The {{earliest}} imperative languages {{were the}} machine languages {{of the original}} computers. In these languages, instructions were very simple, which made hardware implementation easier, but hindered the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN, developed by John Backus at <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Machines</b> (IBM) starting in 1954, {{was the first major}} programming language to remove the obstacles presented by machine code in the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN was a compiled language that allowed named variables, complex expressions, subprograms, and many other features now common in imperative languages. The next two decades saw the development of many other major high-level imperative programming languages. In the late 1950s and 1960s, ALGOL was developed in order to allow mathematical algorithms to be more easily expressed, and even served as the operating system's target language for some computers. MUMPS (1966) carried the imperative paradigm to a logical extreme, by not having any statements at all, relying purely on commands, even to the extent of making the IF and ELSE commands independent of each other, connected only by an intrinsic variable named $TEST. COBOL (1960) and BASIC (1964) were both attempts to make programming syntax look more like English. In the 1970s, Pascal was developed by Niklaus Wirth, and C was created by Dennis Ritchie while he was working at Bell Laboratories. Wirth went on to design Modula-2 and Oberon. For the needs of the United States Department of Defense, Jean Ichbiah and a team at Honeywell began designing Ada in 1978, after a 4-year project to define the requirements for the language. The specification was first published in 1983, with revisions in 1995, 2005 and 2012.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Spare parts {{have become}} {{ubiquitous}} in modern societies and managing their requirements {{is an important}} and challenging task with tremendous cost implications for the organisations that are holding relevant inventories. An important operational issue involved {{in the management of}} spare parts is that of categorising the relevant stock keeping units (SKUs) in order to facilitate decision-making with respect to forecasting and stock control and to enable managers to focus their attention on the most “important” SKUs. This issue has been overlooked in the academic literature although it constitutes a significant opportunity for increasing spare parts availability and/or reducing inventory costs. Moreover, and despite the huge literature developed since the 1970 s on issues related to stock control for spare parts, very few studies actually consider empirical solution implementation and with few exceptions, case studies are lacking. Such a case study is described in this paper, the purpose of which is to offer insight into relevant business practices. Design/methodology/approach – The issue of demand categorisation (including forecasting and stock control) for spare parts management is addressed and details reported of a project undertaken by an <b>international</b> <b>business</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturer for the purpose of improving its European spare parts logistics operations. The paper describes the actual intervention within the organisation in question, as well as the empirical benefits and the lessons learned from such a project. Findings – This paper demonstrates the considerable scope that exists for improving relevant real word practices. It shows that simple well-informed solutions result in substantial organisational savings. Originality/value – This paper provides insight into the empirical utilisation of demand categorisation theory for forecasting and stock control and provides some very much needed empirical evidence on pertinent issues.

Later on, Charles Babbage (1812) theorized, but never built, a fully-automatic steam driven calculating machine. In 1823 he envisioned a better idea, of an "analytical engine" that would have conditional control and where the instructions were to be stored on punched cards. The introduction in 1890 of the punched cards by Herman Hollerith, whose firm later became <b>International</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Machine</b> (IBM), marked the transition from the decimal system to the binary system. The binary system had two states, 0 and 1, corresponding to the place in the card having or not a hole punched in to it. The binary representation could take advantage of many two-state devices like card readers, electric circuits (on/off states) and vacuum tubes, and it led to the next stage in the evolution of computing: the electronic one. The theoretical foundation of modern electronic computers was laid by Alan Turing who described in 1936, [58], a hypothetical device that became known as a Turing machine. A Turing machine can read, write and erase symbols written on squares of an infinite tape. Its endless tape can be interpreted as a general purpose internal memory, on which operations of read, write and erase are performed as in any modern day RAM. The first high-speed electronic digital computer was the ENIAC (Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator), which used almost 18, 000 vacuum tubes stored on 167 square meter [...] ...|$|R
