Nilsson's voice {{in the control room}} is heard on several songs, instructing the recording engineer to add more echo or remove a voice.

500|$|In {{her first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Lauren {{is a member}} of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that [...] "Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce." [...] Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: [...] "Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who do things like that in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: [...] "On those occasions when Meredith's {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her." [...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already {{been in and out of}} that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked." [...] On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV's [...] list of the [...] "Best TV Couples of All Time" [...] and in the same list by TV Guide.|$|E

[...] "Over the years I had always a very tight schedule and those things accumulated. I always put first gymnastics against other things and I felt tired, so I decided at that time to stop my sports activity. I felt like <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> than a few months break, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> a break to do something else besides gymnastics."

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Britain, Knowles made an {{announcement}} which saw his career take a dramatic and unexpected turn. While in Kansas he became a Jehovah's Witness, and in his own words, [...] "I shall continue playing football {{for the time being}} but I have lost my ambition. Though I still do my best on the field <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> time to learn about the Bible and may give up football." [...] Despite this, Wolves got the 1969–70 season off to a great start, winning the first four matches, Knowles scoring in the first three of them. Two home draws and an away defeat in Coventry followed. The eighth game of the season, a 3-3 draw at home against Nottingham Forest, was the last game that Knowles ever played.|$|E

I'm undeserving; and I mean to go on being undeserving. I like it; and that's the truth.
