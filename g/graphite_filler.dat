40|$|AbstractThe {{current work}} studies {{the effect of}} the {{incorporation}} of different amounts of <b>graphite</b> <b>filler</b> on the mechanical properties of epoxy resin and of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites. Graphite-reinforced epoxy-matrix composites were prepared with graphite fractions ranging from 5 to 30 wt%. The carbon-fiber reinforced graphite/epoxy hybrids were prepared using a fixed amount of carbon fiber, and graphite incorporation in the epoxy of 7. 5, 10 and 11. 5 wt%. After cure the produced materials were submitted to tensile and to flexural three point bending tests. Examination of microstructural features and fracture surfaces were undertaken by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Increased <b>graphite</b> <b>filler</b> contents results in improved tensile modulus of the epoxy matrix. The 7. 5, 10 and 11. 5 wt%-graphite materials showed also an increase in the ultimate stress value with increasing filler. Introduction of reinforcement carbon fibers enhances tensile modulus. This increase is higher for the higher amounts of <b>graphite</b> <b>filler</b> in the matrix.

A pin-on-disc test configuration {{was used for the}} experimental study. The different polymeric materials selected for these studies were commercial polyimides (PI), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and flouropolymers. Some of these materials were bulk materials whereas others were used as coatings applied on to the cast iron substrate. The tribological characteristics of the polymers were compared with a reference grey cast iron. The frictional characteristics were evaluated in both static and dynamic conditions. The results have shown that by using polymeric materials it is possible to reduce breakaway friction by an order of magnitude compared to grey cast iron. However, the breakaway friction increased significantly after the wear tests. The polymeric materials having lowest breakaway friction have shown the highest wear {{with the exception of the}} PEEK-PTFE coating which showed low wear. PI with <b>graphite</b> <b>fillers</b> also showed low wear but it resulted in relatively high friction. The carbon fibre reinforced materials resulted in unstable friction as well as higher wear compared to the PI materials with <b>graphite</b> <b>fillers.</b>|$|R

Within this project, critical experiments were conducted for graphite moderated LEU systems to determine core reactivity, flux and power profiles, reaction-rate ratios, the worth of control rods, both in-core and reflector based, the worth of burnable poisons, kinetic parameters, and the effects of moisture ingress on these parameters. One benchmark experiment was evaluated in this report: Core 4. Core 4 represents the only configuration with random pebble packing in the HTR-PROTEUS series of experiments, and has a moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio of 1 : 1. Three random configurations were performed. The initial configuration, Core 4. 1, was rejected because the method for pebble loading, separate delivery tubes for the moderator and fuel pebbles, may not have been completely random; this core loading was rejected by the experimenters. Cores 4. 2 and 4. 3 were loaded using a single delivery tube, eliminating the possibility for systematic ordering effects. The second and third cores differed slightly in the quantity of pebbles loaded (40 each of moderator and fuel pebbles), stacked height of the pebbles in the core cavity (0. 02 m), withdrawn distance of the stainless steel control rods (20 mm), and withdrawn distance of the autorod (30 mm).

In this study, tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of nanocomposites formed by high density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix and <b>graphite</b> powder <b>filler</b> material were determined. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the conductive <b>filler</b> was <b>graphite</b> with an average particle size of 400 nm and purity of 99. 9 %, the matrix material was high density polyethylene (HDPE) with a density of 0. 968 g/cm 3 and a melt index of 5. 8 g/ 10 min, supplied by Petkim A. Ş. - Izmir. Nanocomposites containing up to 30 weight percent of <b>graphite</b> powder <b>filler</b> material were prepared by mixing them in a Brabender Plasticorder at 180 °C for 15 minutes. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of nanocomposites formed were determined as functions of graphite powder content. Findings: An increase in tensile strength and modulus of elasticity was observed with increasing graphite powder content from 0 to 6 %. However, for further increasing the graphite content, tensile strength decreases while modulus of elasticity continued to increase in the composite. Practical implications: Since natural graphite (NG) has a high electrical conductivity at room temperature, it is considered an ideal candidate for manufacturing conductive polymer composites. The recent advancement of nano-scale compounding technique enables the preparation of highly electrically conductive polymeric nanocomposites with low loading of conductive fillers. Nanocomposites may offer enhanced physical features such as increased stiffness, strength, barrier properties and heat resistance, without loss of impact strength in a very broad range of common synthetic or natural polymers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was to tailor a colloidal processing technique called electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for use within the investment casting shell formation process, where the EPD coating procedure {{would be used to}} form the primary ceramic coating on the melt-out substrate. EPD takes place due to the presence of an electric field within the suspension medium, which attracts charged particles in the suspension towards an electrode of opposite charge, onto which they are deposited. For the complex structures created using investment casting, the die cast patterns used as the substrate for the ceramic have to be easily removed, and so substrates materials that can either be melted or dissolved out the material to leave the hollow ceramic shell used. To implement EPD into the investment casting process, this substrate needed to be conducting, and so conducting particle-filled investment casting waxes were created and analysed. Carbon black and <b>graphite</b> <b>filler</b> were incorporated into waxes, and the conductivity and rheology of the resultant composites were studied, to gauge their suitability as an investment casting pattern material. On the basis of both cost and for environmental reasons, the use of aqueous suspension media for EPD was preferred over the more commonly used organic systems.

The wear behavior indicated that the abrasive wear resistance is not only simply related to the hardness of the deposit but that it is also determined by the carbides and matrix structure of the coating. The hypereutectic carbides have the largest (Cr,Fe) (23) C- 6 carbide content and the maximum hardness; however, they show the worst wear resistance due to the large particles were dug out during wearing...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} research {{we investigated}} thermal properties of {{three groups of}} nanostructured materials: (i) magnetic; (ii) reduced graphene oxide films; and (iii) hybrid magnetic – graphite – graphene composites. The thermal measurements were conducted using the transient “hot disk” and “laser flash” techniques. The rare-earth free nanostructured SrFe 12 O 19 permanent magnets were produced by the current activated pressure assisted densification technique. The thermal conductivity of the nanostructured bulk magnets was found to range from 3. 8 to 5. 6 W/mK for the in-plane and 2. 36 W/mk to 2. 65 W/mK for the cross-plane directions, respectively. The heat conduction was dominated by phonons near the room temperature. The anisotropy of heat conduction was explained by the brick-like alignment of crystalline grains with the longer grain size in-plane direction. The thermal conductivity scales up with the average grain size and mass density of the material revealing weak temperature dependence. Using the nanostructured ferromagnetic Fe 3 O 4 composites as an example system, we incorporated graphene and <b>graphite</b> <b>fillers</b> into magnetic material without changing their morphology. It was demonstrated that addition of 5 wt. % of equal mixture of graphene and graphite flakes to the composite results in a factor of × 2. 6 enhancement of the thermal conductivity without significant degradation of the saturation magnetization. We investigated thermal conductivity of free-standing reduced graphene oxide films subjected to a high-temperature treatment of up to 1000 °C. It {{was found that the}} high-temperature annealing dramatically increased the in-plane thermal conductivity, K, of the films from ~ 3 W/mK to ~ 61 W/mK at room temperature. The cross-plane thermal conductivity, K, revealed an interesting opposite trend of decreasing to a very small value of ~ 0. 09 W/mK in the reduced graphene oxide films annealed at 1000 oC. The obtained films demonstrated an exceptionally strong anisotropy of the thermal conductivity, K/K ~ 675, which is substantially larger even than in the high-quality graphite. The strongly anisotropic heat conduction properties of these films can be useful for the thermal filler applications. The results obtained for the nanostructured magnetic and hybrid materials are important for the renewable energy and electronic applications of permanent magnets...|$|R
30|$|Before {{preparation}} of polyethylene composites, the <b>fillers</b> (<b>graphite,</b> calcium carbonate, Gofun, cornstarch, and cellulose) were dried at 120 °C under reduced pressure until constant weights were obtained. Composite sheets with a thickness of 0.50  mm were prepared {{according to the}} previous report (Onishi et al. 2010). Polyethylene fine powder with a particle size less than 125  μm and an additive or fillers were mixed using a mortar and pestle. The resulting mixture was heated to 200 °C at 20  MPa for 5  min in a stainless steel mold, and was gradually cooled by standing at room temperature.|$|R
