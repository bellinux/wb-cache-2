5000|$|Hikers {{and outdoor}} sports enthusiasts {{sometimes}} use [...] "survival bracelets" [...] made of several feet of paracord which is woven into a compact and wearable form. Such bracelets {{are meant to}} be unraveled when one needs rope for whatever purpose — securing cargo, lashing together poles, <b>fixing</b> broken <b>straps</b> or belts, or assisting with water rescues. Young survivalists (Girl Scouts and boy scouts) are also taught the importance of using the paracord as a survival tool. On the other hand, the paracord is a poor choice for an emergency tourniquet as its small diameter will crush tissue without applying the needed pressure to stop bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Unity Structures were a {{construction}} {{company based in}} Rickmansworth. Using common storey-level precast reinforced concrete panels, they produced various updated versions of their bungalow and twin-storey house variations. Using metal bracing within the cavity and metal joists connected at column joints, the PRC columns act as mullions. Copper straps tie the inner panel to outer PRC panel on earlier variants, while later the copper <b>strap</b> <b>fixed</b> to column holding just outer PRC cladding panels.|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectromyography (EMG) {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} widely used in ergonomics and biomechanical studies for analyzing the demand of a job, comparing different tasks, and ergonomics design. To perform such analyses, the EMG data must first be normalized to maximum voluntary contractions (MVC). Normalized EMG data not only allows comparisons to be made between different tasks, but it also informs about how active muscles are relative to their maximum capabilities. Different MVC exercises have become accepted as a standard only by their wide use. However, systematic research {{on the effectiveness of}} different MVC methods are still needed to identify the exercises that will produce the true maximum contraction levels of muscles. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the accepted MVC methods in the literature for the anterior deltoid and trapezius muscles to newly proposed MVC methods. Eight participants were recruited from the Louisiana State University (LSU) population. The proposed MVC for the anterior deltoids involved positioning the shoulders at 90 o flexion with <b>fixed</b> <b>straps</b> wrapped around the distal end of the upper arm. In this position, participants were asked to exert upward forces against the straps while attempting to use only the shoulder muscles. The proposed MVC for the trapezii involved performing lateral raises at 100 o shoulder abduction against fixed chains. These MVC methods were compared to their respective accepted MVCs in the literature. The proposed MVC for the right and left anterior deltoids resulted in 58 % and 46 % higher EMG levels, respectively, than the accepted MVC. The proposed MVC for both the right and left trapezii produced 68 % higher EMG levels than the accepted MVC. The new MVC methods were found to allow the production of more accurate EMG signals of the maximum contraction levels...|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this Walter had to stand upon Ralph's head to gain additional height. He presently, after several attempts, succeeded in <b>fixing</b> the <b>strap</b> firmly against the bar half-way up, and then placing one knee in the loop and putting an arm through the bar to steady himself, he set {{to work at the}} lead. The sharp point of the dagger quickly cut out that near the surface, but farther down the hole narrowed and the task was much more difficult. Several times Ralph relieved him at the work, but at last it was accomplished, and the bar was found to move slightly when they shook it. There now remained only to loosen the cement above, and this was a comparatively easy task; it crumbled quickly before the points of their daggers, and the bar was soon free to move.|$|R
5000|$|The M1C {{was issued}} mid-late war. Like the M2, its most visible {{differences}} {{from the standard}} infantry M1 helmet was the liner. The liner of the M1C, like most paratrooper liners, had a set of [...] "A yokes" [...] or <b>straps</b> <b>fixed</b> {{to the side of}} the liner to enable the use of a leather chin cup to give support to the head and neck during jumps. Often, however, these modified liners could not be manufactured in time for jumps so they were modified by the soldiers themselves.|$|R
60|$|Having {{finished}} his narrative, the miserable-looking little man {{picked up his}} greasy old felt hat that had a leather <b>strap</b> <b>fixed</b> round the crown, in which were stuck a couple of frayed ostrich feathers, and jammed it down over his ears. Then he fell to drawing circles on the soil with his long toes. His auditors only looked at one another. Such a ghastly tale seemed to be beyond comment. They never doubted its truth; the man's way of telling it carried conviction with it; indeed, two of them at any rate had heard such stories before. Most people have {{who live in the}} wilder parts of South Africa, though they are not all to be taken for gospel.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed in}} deep and moody reflection, and was pacing at a {{distance}} from his dependents along {{the upper end of the}} hall, sometimes stopping from time to time to caress and feed a gos-hawk, which sat upon his wrist, with its jesses (i. e. the leathern <b>straps</b> <b>fixed</b> to its legs) wrapt around his hand. The bird, which seemed not insensible to its master's attention, answered his caresses by ruffling forward its feathers, and pecking playfully at his finger. At such intervals the Baron smiled, but instantly resumed the darksome air of sullen meditation. He did not even deign to look upon an object, which few could have passed and repassed so often without bestowing on it a transient glance.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present results of testing a full scale {{reinforced}} concrete T connec-tion by static loading. The connection is a T connection representing a beam-column connection. The beam and column had a square cross section with a 300 mm dimension. The height of the column was 2. 9 m and the clear beam length was 1. 4 m. The connection was initially tested to failure. Galvanised steel straps were used to strengthen the connection. Epoxy resin was used to <b>fix</b> the steel <b>straps</b> to the concrete surface. The connec-tion was tested after the rehabilitation. Results of testing the rehabilitated connection show that the yield and ultimate loads were 65 kN and 95 kN, respectively, compared with the original test results of 75 kN and 84 kN, respectively...|$|R
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the {{backseat}} of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to <b>fix</b> up the <b>strap</b> of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|R
60|$|The French dragoons {{carry a gun}} in a {{way that}} is {{convenient}} for military purposes, because it does not interfere with the immense housings that cavalry soldiers require; but it is not so handy, it does not lie so freely as the above, nor is it as well suited to a traveller or a sportsman. The gun is placed butt downwards, as in the Namaqua method, and leans backwards in the same way; but the under side of the gun, instead of being backwards, or towards the horse's tail, Is towards his head. The butt lies in a shallow bucket, secured by two <b>straps</b> <b>fixed</b> to the front of the saddle; another strap, leading from the pommel, and passing over the right thigh of the rider, is hitched round the barrel of the gun, and has to be unbuckled and cast off when the gun is taken out.|$|R
40|$|Innovation in {{training}} equipment {{is important for}} increasing training effectiveness, performance and changes in body composition, especially in wheelchair users with paraplegia. The main objective of a workout session is to induce an adaptation stimulus, which requires overload of involved muscles by voluntary effort, yet this overload may be highly influenced {{by the size of}} the spinal cord lesion. Krancykl construction is designed to allow exercise on any wheelchair and with adjustable height or width of crank handles, where even the grip handle may be altered. The aim of this study was to determine the differences in body composition, performance and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in paraplegics with a different level of paralyses after a 12 week training programme of a unilateral regime on Krankcycle equipment (a crank machine). The study sample included four men and one women at a different spine lesion level. The 12 weeks programme was successfully completed by four participants, while one subject got injured during the intervention process. Three participants were paraplegics and one was quadriplegic with innervation of the biceps humeri, triceps humeri and deltoideus. The Krankcycle 30 min programme was followed by four other exercises, which were performed after themselves rather than in a circuit training manner as the latter would result in much longer rest periods between exercises, because paraplegics have to be <b>fixed</b> by <b>straps</b> during exercise on hydraulic machines. The RPE after the workout decreased following the twelve week adaptation period...|$|R
40|$|According to the author’s opinion, the {{solution}} for cultural genesis {{issues can be}} tackled through the analysis of structural peculiarities of hollow bodies of vessels of different ceramic complexes. The ceramics of the Malyshev Culture of the Lower Amur is no exception. The article traces the evolution of researchers’ views in regard to Neolithic culture in inner periodization of the region as well as cultural relevance of early complex ceramics by a well known Soviet archeologist academic A. P. Okladnykov – stage of Lower Amur Neolithic culture. Case study: visualization of ceramic collection of one-layer Neolithic settlement Malyshevo- 1 (“At the craftsmen”). Here we identify two vessel groups, which differ through their morphological and decorative features. On the ground of technological assessments of manufacturing techniques by I. G. Glushkov (1996), including methodological developments by A. A. Bobrinsky (1978), the program of hollow body design is researched. The manufacturing techniques are identified (methods of <b>fixing,</b> build-up, <b>straps</b> oiling, types of molding), filling program, cutting and bottom fixing. The mixed programs of hollow body vessels are identified and locations of two pottery traditions are found. A competitive analysis for identifying the peculiarities of Malyshev ceramics and Neolithic materials of the Lower Amur and bordering seaside territories. There are similarities are drawn out between ceramic complexes of Osipov culture of early Neolithic (Lower Amur) and Rudninsky culture (Rudninsky type, Sergeev type) of early Neolithic (seaside territories). ...|$|R
60|$|Before pushing off, the hermit drew a {{revolver}} and a cutlass from his store-room {{in the bow}} {{and handed them to}} Nigel, who thrust the first into his belt and fastened the other to the deck by means of a <b>strap</b> <b>fixed</b> there on purpose to prevent its being rolled or swept off. This contrivance, as well as all the other appliances in the canoe, had previously been pointed out and explained to him. The hermit and negro having armed themselves in similar way, let go the bushes which held them close to the bank and floated out into the stream. They let the canoe drift down a short way so as to be well concealed by the bend in the river and a mass of bushes. Then they slowly paddled over to the opposite side, and commenced to creep up as close to the bank as possible, under the deep shadow of overhanging trees, and so noiselessly that they appeared in the darkness like a passing phantom.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of ski lifts, the need for skiing {{to get to the}} top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank. New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful. Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the [...] "long thong", a long leather <b>strap</b> <b>fixed</b> directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.|$|R
5000|$|After {{turning the}} grain and straw {{upside down and}} leaving it to dry during a lunch break, the farmers carry out {{a second round of}} {{threshing}} in order to separate the last of the grain from the straw. Then, they use pitchforks, rakes and brooms to create a mound. A pair of oxen or mules pulls the threshing board by means of a chain or a <b>strap</b> <b>fixed</b> to a hook nailed in the front plank; donkeys are not used, because unlike mules and oxen they often defecate on the crops. The driver rides on the threshing board, both guiding the draft animals and increasing the weight of the threshing board. If the driver's weight is not enough, large stones are put on the board. In recent times, the animals are sometimes replaced with a tractor; because the driver no longer sits on the board, the weight of stones becomes more important. Children enjoy riding on the threshing board for fun, and the farmers allow it because their weight is useful, as long as the children are not too boisterous. During this process, if the stalks are excessively squashed, two large metal arcs are affixed {{to the back of the}} threshing board; these turn-up and give volume to the straws, behind the threshing.|$|R
