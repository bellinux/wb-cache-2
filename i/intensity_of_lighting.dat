It is, however, observed that for some lighting devices, {{the use of such}} a methodology leads to a lower energy-conversion efficiency (with a lower light intensity for the same amount of electrical input power) than potentially possible. The main problem is related to the saturable characteristic of the electrical-to-optical energy conversion, which follows that of an exponential characteristic, and the fast nature of this reaction in these lighting devices. This paper presents an in-depth discussion on the phenomenon and offers a solution to the problem. Specifically, it is proposed that an n -level type of driving approach to be adopted in the design and construction of power-electronic drivers for fast-response saturable lighting devices to achieve a quasi-optimal lighting efficacy. The result is energy saving for the same required light illumination. Theoretical proofs and experimental results are provided for verification.

In addition to this, and in order to meet concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development, the design of street lighting should take into account the optimization of its energy efficiency, as excessive energy usage is associated with an increase in polluting emissions, namely CO 2.

40|$|In {{intensive}} horticultural cultivation {{natural light}} levels often limit crop production during several periods. For an optimum plant production and product quality light intensity, spectrum and photoperiod {{have to be}} adapted {{to the needs of}} the crops at every moment. Light has to be optimised together with all other growth factors like temperature, humidity and CO 2. For a sustainable greenhouse production the use of freely available sunlight has to be preferred. New transparent greenhouse covering materials, like ETFE, glass with new anti-reflection coatings or materials with micro-surface structures, transmit a very high amount of light into the greenhouse. Other new materials are able to scatter the incoming light and make it diffuse. Diffuse light penetrates deeper into the canopy, increases light interception by the crop, influences micro-climate and increases crop production by 6. 5 - 9. 2 % in The Netherlands, the potential in lower latitudes is even higher. Other materials manipulate light spectrum. Photoselective nettings have been developed in different colours influencing morphogenesis and crop production. Fluorescent plastic films combine effects on morphogenesis with high light transmission, especially important for higher latitudes. When sunlight is optimized it can still be necessary to add artificial light to ensure a year-round supply of horticultural products. There is still room for improving the crop energy efficiency under artificial lighting by changing duration and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting,</b> different growing systems and plant densities. Since artificial lighting requires a high amount of energy, new artificial lighting systems have been developed, such as interlighting and light emitting diodes (LED).
