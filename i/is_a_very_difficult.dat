5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> {{structure}} to study {{because it is}} so thin and fragile. In spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function.|$|E
5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Alan Turing {{proposed}} a general procedure {{to test the}} intelligence of an agent {{now known as the}} Turing test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> challenge and at present all agents fail.|$|E

25|$|As noted at the beginning, {{the effects}} of the atomic {{structure}} of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> problem, and only limited progress has been made. However, it seems probable that the main influences on the theory of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling will (in effect) be to change the values of P and ν in eq. (15), by amounts that cannot easily be estimated at present.|$|E
25|$|Canmore <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> {{place to}} find {{affordable}} housing, and pet owners or families may have difficulty arranging accommodation. To alleviate the housing crunch, Canmore has pursued several affordable housing projects. In 2000, the Town of Canmore established the Canmore Community Housing Corporation (CCHC) to provide housing solutions for a healthy and balanced community. CCHC administers a Perpetually Affordable Housing (PAH) Program consisting of 41 ownership and 60 rental housing units at below-market purchase prices and rental rates. Mountain Haven Co-operative Homes Ltd. administers its own PAH development that provides 44 equity and non-equity (lease to own) units.|$|E
25|$|Resist dyeing {{was common}} {{from the late}} Roman period for those outside the Court, and woodblock {{printing}} dates to at least the 6th century, and possibly earlier - again this would function as a cheaper alternative to the woven and embroidered materials of the rich. Apart from Egyptian burial-cloths, rather fewer cheap fabrics have survived than expensive ones. It should also be remembered that depicting a patterned fabric in paint or mosaic <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> task, often impossible in a small miniature, so the artistic record, which often shows patterned fabrics in large-scale figures in the best quality works, probably under-records the use of patterned cloth overall.|$|E

25|$|The Draught of Peace {{provides}} personal comfort, calms {{anxiety and}} soothes agitation. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape sets the potion {{as one of}} his lessons. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> potion to make as the ingredients have to be added in a very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred exactly the right number of times and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to exactly the right level for the right number of minutes before the final ingredient is added. Hannah Abbott had to have this potion in Order of the Phoenix to reduce her anxiety over the upcoming Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s).|$|E
25|$|The PEMFC {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to mobile phones, because of its compactness. However, the water management is crucial to performance: too much water will flood the membrane, too little will dry it; in both cases, power output will drop. Water management <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> subject in PEM systems, primarily because water in the membrane is attracted toward the cathode of the cell through polarization. A wide variety of solutions for managing the water exist including integration of electroosmotic pumps. Furthermore, the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by carbon monoxide (no more than one part per million is usually acceptable) and the membrane is sensitive to things like metal ions, which can be introduced by corrosion of metallic bipolar plates, metallic components in the fuel cell system or from contaminants in the fuel/oxidant.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

50|$|The early 20th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> time in France-Vatican {{relations}} {{because of}} tensions over church-state separation (laicité) and anticlericalism, which were condemned by Pius X, and {{which led to}} the freezing of relations.|$|R
500|$|In three-cushion billiards, {{sometimes}} called three-cushion carom, or carambole, {{the object is}} to carom off both object balls with at least three [...] being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball. Three-cushion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> game. Averaging one point per [...] is professional-level play, and averaging 1.5 to 2 is world-class play. An average of one means that for every turn at the table, a player makes 1 point and misses once, thus making a point on 50% of his or her shots.|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

2500|$|These are all algebraic, and in {{some sense}} most {{surfaces}} are in this class.
