5|$|The {{introduction}} of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially {{increased the number}} of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975. Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 were caught in the North Atlantic. Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by <b>industrial</b> <b>catches</b> by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century. Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s. After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Gotō Islands.|$|E

This study gives an overview of Mozambique’s marine fishing history from the colonial period to the present, including how fishing was affected by the country’s 16 -year civil war. Since the 1950 s, when the compilation of global fisheries data by FAO began, Mozambique has reported primarily <b>industrial</b> <b>catches</b> and has vastly under-reported the nation’s small-scale fishing sector due to lack of resources and civil strife. This study tentatively reconstructs small-scale catches, <b>industrial</b> <b>catches,</b> and discards. In total, small-scale catches may account for an average of 87 % of Mozambique’s national marine fisheries landings. Since 2000, the fishing sector as a whole has landed between 115, 000 and 140, 000 tonnes per year, which is 5. 5 times greater than the statistics reported by FAO based on country reports. Though there is a large degree of uncertainty with this work, the assumptions made herein are better than the alternative, i. e., that the smallscale sector has no landings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} industrial {{output and}} labor productivity growth around the poor periphery 1870 - 1975 (Latin America, the European periphery, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia). Intensive and extensive industrial growth accelerated there over this critical century. The precocious poor periphery leaders underwent a surge and more poor countries joined their club. Furthermore, by the interwar {{the majority were}} catching up on Germany, the US and the UK, a process that accelerated even more up to 1950 - 1975. What explains {{the spread of the}} industrial revolution world-wide and this catching up? Productivity growth certainly made their industries more competitive in home and foreign markets, but other forces mattered as well. A falling terms of trade raised the relative price of manufactures in domestic markets, as did real exchange rate depreciation. In addition, increasingly cheap fuel and non-fuel intermediates from globally integrating markets seems to have taken resource advantages away from the European and North American leaders, and integrating world financial markets also reduced the cheap capital advantage of the leaders. However, ever-cheaper labor was not a serious cause of <b>industrial</b> <b>catch</b> up, offering little support for the Krugman-Venables (1995) model. Furthermore, tariffs did not foster <b>industrial</b> <b>catch</b> up either, but rather poor industry performance fostered high tariffs. Markets and policies mattered, not just institutions. ...|$|R

However, {{in order to}} create effective and sustainable fisheries policies and management that will ensure a growing population can prosper, policy makers need to know what is being fished and how much is fished. Vanuatu, the smallest country in Melanesia, has a declared and claimed Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over 820, 000 km 2 and fisheries resources play a large part in the food security and economic stability of this country. This reconstruction of the total marine fisheries catch of Vanuatu for 1950 – 2014 faced major data gaps. It showed that the reconstructed total catches of nearly 1. 4 million tonnes (metric tons) 40 % higher than the 977, 997 tonnes reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on behalf of Vanuatu for the same period. However, if large-scale <b>industrial</b> <b>catches</b> are excluded, the reconstructed small-scale fisheries catches (~ 270, 000 tonnes) were over 200 % higher than the 114, 862 tonnes of reported catch that were assumed to represent the small-scale sector in FAO data. Subsistence catches made up almost 93 % of small-scale catches, followed by artisanal and recreational catches with ~ 7 and < 1 %, respectively.

40|$|Marine oxygen-deficient environments {{with high}} {{sedimentation}} rates and high primary productivity can provide relevant information regarding variations of ocean–climatic {{conditions in the}} past. In the Humboldt current ecosystem, which now hosts huge populations of pelagic fishes (mainly anchovy and sardine), fish scale abundance in the sedimentary record may be useful indicators of environmental change. Here we assess such a proxy record in a 42 cm-long sedimentary core collected from 80 min Mejillones Bay (23 S, northern Chile). We also analyse fish remains in surface sediment sampled along a bathymetric transect (from 10 to 110 m water depth) in the same bay. In the core-top record, the fluctuations of sardine and anchovy scale deposition rates (SDR) agreed with those of <b>industrial</b> <b>catches</b> for these two species in northern Chile, tending to validate the SDR as a proxy of local fish biomass when bottom anoxic conditions prevail. However, apparent SDR for records prior to 1820 have probably been influenced by dissolution processes linked to the oxygenation of the bottom environment of Mejillones Bay, as suggested by other proxy records. After 1820, the fluctuations in the relative abundance of sardine and anchovy scales point to alternating warm and cold conditions during about 30 years and then a progressively cooler period. Since ca. 1870, marked fluctuations of SDR of both species are observed, probably {{as a consequence of}} the onset of a different oceanographic regime characterized by intensified upwelling, stronger subsurface oxygen deficiency, higher primary productivity, and enhanced ‘‘ENSOlike” interdecadal variability. While anchovy SDR fluctuated in periods of 25 – 40 years, only two peak periods of sardine SDR occurred (late 19 th century and late 20 th century), suggesting that sardine abundance depends on other ocean–climatic factors.

Fish length and condition increased from the early 1970 s to the early 1990 s and then decreased. Fish length positively cor-related with Ross Sea ice extent in early spring, a relationship possibly caused by more ice encouraging larger fish to move farther south over the shelf and into the study area. Fish condition positively correlated with the amount of open water in the Ross Sea during the previous summer (Feb), perhaps reflecting greater avail-ability of prey with the higher productivity that more open water brings.

40|$|We report {{analyses}} of a dataset spanning 38 years of near-annual fishing for Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni, using a vertical setline through the fast ice of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972 - 2010. This constitutes {{one of the}} longest biological time series in the Southern Ocean, and certainly the longest for any fish. Fish total length, condition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) were derived from the more than 5500 fish caught. Contrary to expectation, length-frequency was dominated by fish in the upper half of the <b>industrial</b> <b>catch.</b> The discrepancy may be due to biases in the sampling capabilities of vertical (this study) versus benthic (horizontal) fishing gear (industry long lines), related to the fact that only large Antarctic toothfish (more than 100 cm TL) are neutrally buoyant and occur in the water column. Fish length and condition increased from the early 1970 s to the early 1990 s and then decreased, related to sea ice cover, with lags of 8 months to 5 years, and may ultimately be related to the fishery (which targets large fish) and changes in the Southern Annular Mode through effects on toothfish main prey, Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum. CPUE was constant through 2001 and then decreased dramatically, likely related to the industrial fishery, which began in 1996 and which concentrates effort over the Ross Sea slope, where tagged McMurdo fish have been found. Due to limited prey choices and, therefore, close coupling among mesopredators of the Ross Sea, Antarctic toothfish included, the fishery may be altering the trophic structure of the Ross Sea...|$|R
40|$|The large tuna {{resources}} of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are delivering great economic benefits to Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) through sale of licences to distant water fishing nations and employment in fish processing. However, tuna needs to contribute to Pacific Island societies in another important way by increasing local access to the fish required for good nutrition to help combat the world's highest levels of diabetes and obesity. Analyses reported here demonstrate that coastal fisheries in 16 of the 22 PICTs will not provide the fish recommended for good nutrition of growing Pacific Island populations, and that by 2020 tuna will need to supply 12 % of the fish required by PICTs for food security, increasing to 25 % by 2035. In relative terms, the percentages of the region's tuna catch that will be needed in 2020 and 2035 {{to fill the gap}} in domestic fish supply are small, i. e., 2. 1 % and 5. 9 % of the average present-day <b>industrial</b> <b>catch,</b> respectively.

The actions, research and policies required to implement these interventions effectively, and the investments needed to maintain the stocks underpinning the considerable socio-economic benefits that flow from tuna, are described...|$|R

The Philippines was very much part of that catching up. In the decade or so up to 1913, Philippine industrial output grew at 6. 3 percent per annum, way above that achieved by the industrial leaders. Indeed, the Philippines was the third Asian country to enter the 5 % industrial growth club: Japan 1899, China 1900, the Philippines 1913, Taiwan 1914, Korea 1921, and India 1929. The Philippines continued its <b>industrial</b> <b>catch</b> up during the interwar years 1920 - 1938, as it did during the ISI years 1950 - 1972.

What were the causes of this regime switch? Was it political instability at a critical time in the 1980 s? Was it a subsequent failure to exploit the move of Japanese manufacturing FDI into the region? Was it an institutional weakness benign in the pre- 1982 past but made more powerful since?

50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, Norway pout, blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total <b>industrial</b> fish <b>catch</b> was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|R

Recent statistics point towards overfishing, {{but the situation}} {{is not the same}} for all: Eg. there is a steady decline of Cape Verde artisanal catches, as opposed to a rise in <b>industrial</b> <b>catch</b> (INDP 2012). The aim of the paper is to investigate the current and future relative sectoral development (modelling part), their socioeconomic ties and mutual perception of competition (descriptive part), and its impact on and interrelations with policy making (modelling and quantitative part), based on an extensive survey dataset collected in Senegal and Cape Verde inter alia data on socioeconomics, business data, fishing activity and management views. Perceptions on the availability of resources and fishing effort indeed coincide with available data in both countries. Small-scale fishermen are more prone to economic risks. We find that there is substantial mobility from the small-scale into the industrial sector. No sectoral differences with regard to management views are obvious. Views on effective government support are nearly not affected by sectoral affiliation. I use the FISHRENT model under an open access setting by Pavel Salz (2010) for an analysis on fleet structures and effect from the introduction of policies. I expect to find immediate asymmetric effects. However, the long-term effects are expected to differ greatly with regard to the policy, sectoral development and factor use and availability. Additionally, I plan a regression analysis on factors influencing the fishermen's viewpoints on fisheries management...|$|R

The activities of a 46 vessels fleet were analyzed during the period July 2007 -November 2008 using data base generated by the National Program for Tracking Fishing Vessels with Satellite - PREPS. The fishing pattern was also analyzed during the closed season of the piramutaba, between September 15 th and November 30 th of both years, when the vessels have temporary permission to catch other fish down the isobath of 20 meters. The range of 10 nautical miles from the coast of Amapá, Pará and Maranhão States along with an area of natural breeding of estuarine region aquatic species of Amazonas and Pará Rivers, were considered areas of restricted fishing activities.

We reviewed published reports, collected and analyzed physical, chemical and ecological data sets, and developed models for the physical (atmosphere and ocean) and ecological components of this large marine ecosystem, to examine prevalent scientific questions regarding climate variability and change in the region, covering three time scales (ENSO, decadal-tointerdecadal, and long-term trend). We were able to describe how the Gulf of California influences the northward propagation of coastal trapped Kelvin waves associated with El Niño (ENSO) events, and how this signal, together with changes in the atmospheric forcing, results in a ENSO signature inside the Gulf. For the decadal-to-multidecadal scales, we found coherent trends among series, and with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The long-term temperature signal for the Gulf of California shows a warming {{that occurred in the}} mid 20 th century, approximately a decade before that in the California Current.

The fact and the theory based on it are no novelties. Early in the sixteenth century, indeed, the Sieur Gonneville, skipper of Honfleur, sailing round the Cape of Good Hope, made his way right across the Southern Ocean to some vague point of South America where he found the people still just in the intermediate stage between the use of natural vessels and the invention of pottery.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine why information technology has become one of important issues in the current international relations and political economy and how political economic institutions of a nation could help the development of the IT industries and infrastructure or might hinder the development. The theoretical goal of my study is to develop a theory of institutional inertia and adjustment with the case study of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s computer software sector development. My case study of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s government-led strategy and <b>industrial</b> policy to <b>catch</b> up with the US hegemony called Wintelism illustrates that institutional fitness in the past could change into institutional inertia in the current New Economy. Unlike the cases of endogenous technological innovation based on its own institutional assets of political economy, when a new technological innovation is exogenously introduced to a nation, the industrial and economic governance system of the nation usually needs to adjust its political economic institutions in order to adopt the newly introduced technological innovation. Without the adjustment, it becomes much harder to internalize the technological advance in the economy and society. My theory of institutional inertia and adjustment points up an urgent need of institutional adjustment in order for the developmental state to cope with the current IT revolution, to build an information-intensive society, and to compete with foreign rivals in the international market. As clarified in the e-Japan Strategy, the Japanese political economic institutions must be adjusted to more suitable ones for IT sector development. If not, Japan will continue to fall behind in competition in the increasing profit business of software and will not complete its goal of informatization. ...|$|R
