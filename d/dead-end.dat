5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, <b>dead-end</b> corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-684, NY22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of Brewster on what is now CR50, a <b>dead-end</b> road maintained by Putnam County. Modern NY22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road {{on the opposite side}} of the Croton River via the NY981B connector. South of Copake Falls, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of NY344.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being <b>dead-end</b> communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

The route heads northward, intersecting with local <b>dead-end</b> streets deep in the forests of rural Morris County. Route 183 passes a nearby factory and intersects U.S. Route 46. The route continues northward, crossing over a creek and entering downtown Netcong. Downtown Netcong is highly developed, and Route 183 serves as the main street through the community. The highway intersects with Allen Street (Morris County Route 631) before running along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and into Sussex County.|$|E

Route163 passes several residences to the north and a short stretch of homes to the south. There is a short intersection with an unnamed local road. After that intersection, Route163 passes a truck stop that is visible on both Route46, which parallels to the south, and the short state highway. There is another short truck stop before an intersection with a return ramp to Route46. Route163 officially terminates at a barricaded <b>dead-end</b> near Hemlock Hill Road.|$|E

There is an intersection with Delaware Drive just after the inception. Delaware Drive heads to a <b>dead-end</b> at the banks of the Delaware River.

5|$|There {{is still}} a {{functioning}} farm in Salta, which is passed on the lane accessing the hamlet. There are other farms in Mawbray and Allonby, and the hamlet is surrounded by farmland belonging to these local farmers. Though the road through the hamlet comes to a <b>dead-end,</b> and is accessed by lane only from the coastal B5300 road or Mawbray, two public bridleways at the end provide access over the fields to Hailforth and Mawbray, with the latter emerging {{right next to the}} pub in the centre of the village. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the peat to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside.|$|E

5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long <b>dead-end</b> siding was {{provided}} for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the northbound line {{just south of the}} station.

The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.|$|E

The third part deals with an algorithm to extract conserved moieties. In a fourth part the concept of nullcycles is introduced. A nullcycle is composed of two parallel pathways, running in opposite direction, so that the net result is zero. Copyright c○IFAC 2004...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} early {{obstacles}} recognition in {{wireless sensor networks}} under various traffic patterns. In the presence of obstacles, the efficiency of routing algorithms is increased by voluntarily avoiding some regions {{in the vicinity of}} obstacles, areas which we call <b>dead-ends.</b> In this paper, we first propose a fast convergent routing algorithm with proactive <b>dead-ends</b> detection together with a formal definition and description of <b>dead-ends.</b> Secondly, we present a generalization of this algorithm which improves performances in all to many and all to all traffic patterns. In a third part we prove that this algorithm is optimal up to a constant factor as we prove it computes path whose length is at most 2 pi + 1 times longer than the shortest path. In a fourth part we consider the reactive version of the algorithm which is an extension of a previously known early obstacle detection algorithm. Finally we give experimental results to illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms in different scenarios. ...|$|R
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a <b>dead-end</b> road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a <b>dead-end</b> street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{resubmit}} its 1901 bill, the CLR {{presented a}} much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The reversing loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points, adopting the committee's recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the <b>dead-end</b> reversing siding west of Shepherd's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south. At {{the southern end of}} Hammersmith Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road (now Shepherd's Bush Road) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there.|$|E
