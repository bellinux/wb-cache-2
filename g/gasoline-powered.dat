5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use <b>gasoline-powered</b> engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving <b>gasoline-powered</b> ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{sessions}} {{were led by}} Sébastien Bourdais, with his Peugeot 908 HDi FAP setting a lap time of 3:26.707, a second and a half ahead of two trailing Audis. Pescarolo Sport had the fastest <b>gasoline-powered</b> car in fourth. In the LMP2 class, the pair of Barazi-Epsilon entries led with identical times of 3:39.016; ASM Team Racing for Portugal trailed the pair in class.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{a product}} of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and <b>gasoline-powered</b> tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful <b>gasoline-powered</b> {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Karl Benz {{was granted}} the first patent on a {{reliable}} <b>gasoline-powered</b> engine in Germany. In 1885, he produced the first true gasoline automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen. The new invention was quickly refined and gained popularity in Germany and France, and interest {{grew in the}} United Kingdom and the United States. In 1902, Ransom Olds created the production line concept for mass-producing lower-cost automobiles. Henry Ford soon refined the concept so that by 1914, middle-class laborers could afford automobiles built by Ford Motor Company.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward <b>gasoline-powered</b> models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a <b>gasoline-powered</b> car instead.|$|E
5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, {{about half the time}} it takes to refill a <b>gasoline-powered</b> car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with <b>gasoline-powered</b> cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go will run out of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E
5|$|The library {{incorporates}} {{many aspects}} of environmentally-sensitive design, in accordance to Clinton's work involving sustainable development. It first earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification under the United States Green Building Council LEED for New Construction program in 2004 and later Platinum Certification under LEED-EB (LEED for Existing Buildings) in 2007. The library's flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there are charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, a rooftop garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels. The garden collects runoff and is maintained {{without the use of}} <b>gasoline-powered</b> lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all <b>gasoline-powered</b> vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, car dealers, gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the industry {{is not ready to}} supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as <b>gasoline-powered</b> car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the <b>gasoline-powered</b> engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel {{is widely}} used in most types of transportation. Trucks and buses, which were often <b>gasoline-powered</b> in the 1920s through 1950s, are now almost {{exclusively}} diesel-powered. The <b>gasoline-powered</b> passenger automobile is the major exception; diesel cars are less numerous worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Henry Ford tested his new Quadricycle, a <b>gasoline-powered</b> motor car, in Detroit on June 4, 1896.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Roadster's battery-to-wheel motor {{efficiency}} was reported as 88% to 90% on average and 80% at peak power. For comparison, internal combustion engines have a tank-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%. Taking {{a more complete}} picture including the cost of energy drawn from its source, Tesla reports that their technology, assuming electricity generated from natural gas-burning power plants, has a high well-to-wheel efficiency of 1.14 kilometers per megajoule, compared to 0.202km/MJ for <b>gasoline-powered</b> sports cars, 0.478km/MJ for <b>gasoline-powered</b> commuter cars, 0.556km/MJ for hybrid cars, and 0.348km/MJ for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{production}} of the French <b>gasoline-powered</b> VELOSOLEX ceased in Hungary. However, production continues in China and has restarted in France. In the United States, Velosolex America markets the VELOSOLEX worldwide.|$|E
25|$|A {{conventional}} vehicle {{can become}} a greener vehicle by mixing in renewable fuels or using less carbon intensive fossil fuel. Typical <b>gasoline-powered</b> cars can tolerate up to 10% ethanol. Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol, though there were discontinued. Another available option is a flexible-fuel vehicle which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol, up to 85% in North America and Europe, and up to 100% in Brazil. Another existing option is to convert a conventional <b>gasoline-powered</b> to allow the alternative use of CNG. Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Iran, India, Italy, and China have the largest fleets of natural gas vehicles in the world.|$|E
25|$|Whiting carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled {{diesel-powered}} Jensen survey launches. For {{utility and}} rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with <b>gasoline-powered</b> outboard motors, a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat.|$|E
25|$|However, compact folding {{bicycles}} {{are permitted}} on all MBTA vehicles at all times, provided {{that they are}} kept completely folded {{for the duration of}} the trip, including passage through faregates. <b>Gasoline-powered</b> vehicles, bike trailers, and Segways are prohibited.|$|E
25|$|The {{campground}} and camps have {{facilities for}} {{swimming in the}} lake near its shore. Boating is permitted on the lake as long as <b>gasoline-powered</b> engines are not used. Diving is also permitted with advanced open-water certification due to the lake's depth.|$|E
25|$|After 38 {{minutes of}} flying various manoeuvres, battery {{capacity}} may be 25%. From the inside, the Electro {{is very similar}} to the <b>gasoline-powered</b> version, but from the outside, the Electro is much quieter. Electricity costs are about 1/10 of gasoline.|$|E
25|$|American Honda {{has also}} {{been active in the}} {{deployment}} of low-emissions vehicles in the U.S., including the first <b>gasoline-powered</b> vehicles to meet California's Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV), Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV), and Super Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) exhaust emissions requirements.|$|E
25|$|Around the 1880s, {{businesses}} such as Rouse Hazard Co. in Peoria, were {{dealers and}} importers of bicycles and accessories worldwide. Charles Duryea, {{one of the}} cycle manufacturers, developed the first commercially available <b>gasoline-powered</b> automobile in the U.S. in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Frances Slocum Lake is a warm-water fishery. Fisherman {{can catch}} crappie, bluegill, walleye, muskellunge, pickerel, and smallmouth and largemouth bass from the shore, fishing pier and from {{electric}} or non-powered boats. <b>Gasoline-powered</b> boats are prohibited at Frances Slocum State Park.|$|E
25|$|In France, the <b>gasoline-powered</b> {{motorized}} bicycle, known popularly as the vélomoteur or vélomoto {{was popular}} during the 1930s, {{and continued to}} be widely sold in early postwar years {{as a means of}} transportation during a period of gasoline shortages and limited automobile production.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} he {{imported}} 65 <b>gasoline-powered</b> cars from France {{and began the}} New York Taxicab Company. The cabs were originally painted red and green, but Allen repainted them all yellow to be visible from a distance. By 1908 the company was running 700 taxicabs.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1953, the only remaining streetcar lines fed two tunnels— the main Tremont Street Subway network downtown and the short tunnel (now the Harvard Bus Tunnel) in Harvard Square. <b>Gasoline-powered</b> buses {{could not be used}} in the tunnels due to the problem of venting exhaust fumes.|$|E
25|$|Peirce carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled {{diesel-powered}} Jensen survey launches, each {{equipped with}} the same Hydrochart system as aboard Peirce. For utility and rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with <b>gasoline-powered</b> outboard motors, a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{rate the}} Prius {{as among the}} cleanest {{vehicles}} sold in the United States based on smog-forming emissions.

25|$|Stacy Building– the {{location}} where, in 1892–93, the Duryea Brothers built the first, American, <b>gasoline-powered</b> car, which in 1895 {{won the first}} automobile race in Chicago, Illinois. A model of the Duryea Brothers' first car sits in a tree-shaded park beside the historic location, amidst the restaurants and bars of the Club Quarter.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{are exempt from}} the annual circulation tax or ownership tax for five years from the date of their first registration. Thereafter, EVs benefit from a 75% reduction of the tax rate applied to equivalent <b>gasoline-powered</b> vehicles. In the region of Lombardy, electric {{vehicles are}} exempt from the annual ownership tax.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{first product}} was a <b>gasoline-powered</b> {{delivery}} truck engineered by Ford and completed in January 1900. It received favorable coverage {{in a local}} newspaper, but was not without its flaws; it was slow, heavy, unreliable and complicated to manufacture. Later in life, Ford recalled this period as one that was driven by profit rather than innovation.|$|E
25|$|The {{redesigned}} {{and more}} efficiente fourth generation Prius was released for retail customers in Japan in December 2015. The launch in North American market {{is scheduled for}} January 2016, and February in Europe. The 2016 model year Prius Eco surpassed the 2000 first generation Honda Insight as the all-time EPA-rated most fuel efficient <b>gasoline-powered</b> car available in the U.S. without plug-in capability.|$|E
25|$|ROUSH CleanTech's propane autogas-fueled {{vehicles}} {{have the}} same horsepower, torque and towing capacity as their <b>gasoline-powered</b> equivalents. The shift to a dedicated liquid propane fuel system does not affect vehicle functionality. Ford's factory warranty remains intact on the ROUSH CleanTech vehicles. Propane emits fewer greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides than gasoline, diesel, heavy fuel oil or E85 ethanol per unit of energy.|$|E
25|$|The Yamaha R-MAX is a Japanese {{unmanned}} helicopter {{developed by}} the Yamaha Motor Company in the 1990s. The two-bladed, <b>gasoline-powered</b> aircraft is remote-controlled by a line-of-sight user; it was designed primarily for agricultural use, and is capable of precise aerial spraying of crops. The R-MAX {{has been used in}} Japan and abroad for agriculture {{and a variety of other}} roles, including reconnaissance, disaster response and technology development.|$|E
