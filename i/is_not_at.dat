5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> all clear.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

5000|$|The easiest {{starting}} {{place is}} to find a [...] "maximum cell"; that is, a numbered cell which if the walls <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the maximum distance possible, the number <b>is</b> <b>not</b> satisfied. For example, in a 10x10 grid which has <b>not</b> started to <b>be</b> solved, a 19-cell is a maximum cell, since if the four walls <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the edges of the grid, the number of cells visible wouldn't be enough. After making some progress, [...] "minimum cells" [...] appear, where if the walls <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the minimum distance possible, the number <b>is</b> <b>not</b> satisfied.|$|R

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> fault.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} mourning doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> immediate risk. As a gamebird, the mourning dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|Tigers can {{occupy a}} wide range of habitat types, but will usually require {{sufficient}} cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines in a pride. A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.|$|E
