50|$|A12 Authentication (Access Authentication for 1xEV-DO) is a CHAP-based {{mechanism}} {{used by a}} CDMA2000 Access Network (AN) {{to authenticate}} a 1xEV-DO Access Terminal (AT). A12 authentication occurs when an AT first attempts to access the AN and is repeated after some authentication timeout period. The element in the AN that performs this authentication is the Radio Network Controller (RNC) using its Access Network AAA (AN-AAA). In order to support A12 authentication, matching A12 credentials (i.e., an A12 Network Address Identifier (NAI) and A12 CHAP key) must be provisioned into the AT and the user’s home AAA server. Since these credentials are only shared between the AT and its home AAA, the AN-AAA forwards A12 challenge responses received from an AT to its home AAA {{to determine whether they}} are correct. A12 authentication is separate from packet <b>data</b> <b>authentication</b> that may occur later when a data session is being established.|$|E
