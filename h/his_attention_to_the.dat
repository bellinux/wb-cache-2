5|$|In 358, Julian first turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Frankish tribes, {{crossing}} the lower Rhine {{and forced the}} Salii and Chamavi tribes to surrender and become tributarii (tribute-payers). He then restored three important forts on the lower Meuse river. Finally, he again switched <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Alamanni, {{crossing the}} Rhine at Mainz and forcing the submission of the new paramount kings Hortarius and Surmarius.|$|E
5|$|Following Congressional {{passage of}} the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act in 1980, {{attorney}} Tom Tureen turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mashantucket Pequot case.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 1938, Hitler {{announced}} {{the unification of}} Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. Hitler then turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{he turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anstruther Burghs, {{a set of}} five burghs which were located only 15 miles from his newly {{purchased}} estate at Balgonie in Fife.|$|R
50|$|With Antalya {{secure and}} the western marches at peace, Kaykaus turned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. During the Fifth Crusade, the crusaders allied with Kaykaus and forced <b>the</b> Ayyubids <b>to</b> {{undertake}} a two-front conflict.|$|R
50|$|Gorham {{moved to}} Japan {{with his wife}} and {{children}} in 1918 during World War I. He was initially interested in the aviation industry, but after a year without success shifted <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> automotive industry.|$|R
5|$|Although Balzac {{himself did}} not marry until 1850, he {{was fascinated by}} the subject. Soon after Les Chouans was {{published}} in 1829, he released a treatise about the institution called Physiologie du Mariage. <b>His</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> details of relationships – failed and successful – are woven into Les Chouans, and Marie herself is based on a woman with whom he had had an affair.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{alarmed by}} Malta's preparations, the Ottoman sultan {{directed}} <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Venice, {{with which he}} declared war in 1716. In reply to a plea for assistance, the Grand Master Perellos lent five of his warships and a few galleys to repel the Ottoman invasion.|$|E
5|$|To {{fend off}} the Huns, Theodosius had to pay an {{enormous}} annual tribute to Attila. His successor, Marcian, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West. After Attila's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed, {{and many of the}} remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|After Campbell's {{achievement}} of the 300 mph land speed record with Blue Bird in 1935 {{he retired from the}} land speed record. Shortly afterwards he switched <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water speed record, at that time dominated by the American Gar Wood.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Rabih {{also turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Borno Empire of Shehu (king) Ashimi of Borno. Borno was a Sahelian Kingdom that traced its origins back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages. That year, the empire {{consisted}} of 80,000 soldiers, mostly slaves commanded by slaves, {{and was in}} full decline.|$|R
50|$|Much of Ogata's {{life was}} devoted to Rangaku, which was clearly {{displayed}} in the vision he had for Tekijuku. Ogata is known in history for <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medical, or internal therapeutic aspects of Rangaku, including emphasis on diseases and his aid in translation of foreign medicinal terms.|$|R
5|$|When the {{pay-per-view}} began, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) faced Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski. The Dudleyz initially {{dominated the}} match and executed the Wassup? on Nowinski. During the match, Theodore Long, Mack and Nowinski's manager, verbally distracted D-Von, resulting in D-Von punching Long and distracting the referee. Nowinski hit Bubba {{with a face}} mask that he wore. After the referee placed <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> match, Nowiniski pinned Bubba for the win.|$|E
5|$|With {{relations}} between the MR and the LNWR deteriorating, Watkin turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposal to link to Aylesbury. Negotiations between the A and the GWR had broken down, and Watkin seized an opportunity to agree running rights over the A's route north from Aylesbury, taking over the line completely in 1891. In 1888 work began on the extension to Aylesbury.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 49 BC, the {{hardened}} legions of Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed {{to follow up on}} the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|E
50|$|Born in Moscow, Borisovsky entered Moscow Conservatory in 1917 {{studying}} the violin with Mikhail Press. A year later, {{on the advice}} of violist Vladimir Bakaleinikov, Borisovsky turned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viola. He studied with Bakaleinikov and graduated in 1922. Borisovsky became Professor of Viola at the conservatory in 1927.|$|R
50|$|When a renovator (Henry Darrow) {{decides to}} {{purchase}} an old theater with <b>the</b> intent <b>to</b> fix it up and sell it for a profit, he's unaware that {{the place is a}} safe haven for the supernatural. As he spends more and more time there, it becomes more apparent that <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location are very unwelcome.|$|R
5000|$|After the show, Constantine Petrovich began a {{reckless}} flirtation with Agrippina and <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{wife of a}} fellow officer caused people to gossip. Agrippina's husband, Prince Tariel [...] "Taia" [...] Dadiani, {{was one of the}} officers under Duke Constantine's command It was considered very bad form to take advantage of one's rank in such a manner.|$|R
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> severe economic difficulties and {{the disintegration of the}} Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the renewal of Arab invasions, and to a sequence of natural disasters such as the eruptions of the volcanic island of Thera, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian concluded that the Empire had lost divine favour. Already in 722 {{he had tried to}} force the conversion of the Empire's Jews, but soon he began to turn <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> veneration of icons, which some bishops had come to regard as idolatrous. In 726, Leo published an edict condemning their use and showed himself increasingly critical of the iconophiles. He formally banned depictions of religious figures in a court council in 730.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which {{could account for the}} discrepancy. This {{was the first time that}} Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
50|$|In his {{southern}} expansion Arnulf inevitably had {{conflict with}} the Normans, {{who were trying to}} secure their northern frontier. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men. The Viking threat was receding during the later years of Arnulf's life, and he turned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reform of the Flemish government.|$|R
50|$|Loudon then {{returned}} <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> siege of Glatz. The arrival of his heavy artillery had allowed <b>the</b> siege <b>to</b> properly begin on 20 July and a trench had been dug. Once the guns had weakened the defences Loudon {{was able to}} organise volunteers <b>to</b> storm <b>the</b> city, opening the gates and allowing the remainder of <b>the</b> Austrian army <b>to</b> enter.|$|R
50|$|A sleek-haired, pale young man, {{known to}} his intimates and the {{personal}} paragraphs of sporting weeklies as 'Tanky', hard-drinking socialite Gifford is in company with Cynthia Drassilis early in <b>The</b> Little Nugget. <b>His</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young lady anger Peter Burns, who refers to Gifford as 'a most unspeakable little cad', and ends up engaged to Cynthia to keep {{her out of the}} clutches of such unsavoury men.|$|R
5|$|Simpson and Percy {{made the}} podium in every {{meeting of the}} ISAF Sailing World Cup in 2012, {{including}} gold at the Hyeres French World Cup regatta. They competed at the 2012 Olympic Games, again in the Star class, failing to defend their title despite being in the lead throughout the competition, but winning the silver medal. After the Star class {{was removed from the}} Olympic sailing disciplines, Simpson turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> America's Cup, moving to San Francisco to train in March 2013. He was known for his athleticism, and for his attention to detail in preparing the boat to obtain the best possible performance.|$|E
5|$|The venture, {{financed by}} John Quiller Rowett, is {{sometimes}} referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite was true for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} nineties Julian turned <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USA, making two albums in Nashville with E Street Band bass-player Garry Tallent {{producing}} {{and a host}} of local guests, including Vince Gill, Duane Eddy, Bill Payne and Steve Forbert. ‘Fragile As China’ charted in Germany and helped him build a radio presence and a solid following in the USA, where he still tours at least once a year.|$|R
50|$|Oliver Cromwell {{was now in}} the {{fortunate}} position of having two Scottish armies opposing him with allegiances to two different political parties, the Resolutioners who supported King Charles II and the Protesters or Remonstraters who opposed the King. So Cromwell resolved <b>to</b> confine <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operations of the Western Association army to destroy it and then with his flanks secured march north with the whole of his force, and attacking the Resolutioners army.|$|R
60|$|Ramsbury {{understood}} at {{last that}} his decision was final, and, observing <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new schoolmistress, flattered itself {{that it had}} discovered the reason. It is possible that Miss Lindsay shared their views, but if so she made no sign, and on the many occasions on which she met Mr. Barrett {{on her way to}} and from school greeted him with frank cordiality. Even when he referred to his loneliness, which he did frequently, she made no comment.|$|R
5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and the {{prospects}} of building {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> link to Taunton. He had been the architect of the Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used inclined planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone. In a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E
5|$|While still {{involved}} in the disputes over Legislative Council attributions, Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission. The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned coats of arms of the Romanian counties, each bearing the Steel Crown, as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple escutcheons. He was turning <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Slătineanu branch of his family, and completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of Brăila in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine Analele Brăilei, 1/1929).|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army {{to the aid of}} France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can bet she does!" [...] Seth exclaimed {{with great}} emphasis; {{and then he}} gave all <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> obeying <b>the</b> many {{commands}} which issued from Mrs. Dean's mouth.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not said}} a word, {{since the first}} exclamation of warning, with which he had drawn <b>his</b> friend's <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young girl in the doorway.|$|R
2500|$|Wallner {{then turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{animations}}. As all the animations in <b>the</b> game had <b>to</b> be interchangeable for every settler (walking, bending etc.), he first needed <b>to</b> work on <b>the</b> skeletal animation. Unsatisfied {{with the results}} when he attempted to use 3D Studio Max, he chose instead to build an [...] "extremely primitive skeletal settler which we could put under the visible structure of our figures." [...] <b>The</b> drawback <b>to</b> this approach was that all actions had to animated separately, frame-by-frame.|$|R
