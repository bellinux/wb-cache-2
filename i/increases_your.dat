2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, meditation and relaxation training {{have been found to}} increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are [...] remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear. Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which <b>increases</b> <b>your</b> well-being. Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.|$|E
