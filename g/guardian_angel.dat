Like Black, Means has a nearly-supernatural insight into criminal cases (which she attributes to a <b>guardian</b> <b>angel).</b> When Means is prepared for initiation into the group the angelic presence forsakes her, leading to a mental breakdown as she shelters herself from the viral outbreak orchestrated by the group.
