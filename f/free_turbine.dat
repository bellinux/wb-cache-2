40|$|The REDT (Rotor à Entraînement Direct par Turbine – Direct Turbine Driven Rotor) is a {{new concept}} for {{helicopter}} rotor drives developed by Sagita in Belgium. It works without any mechanical link between the engine {{on one side and}} the rotor drive on the other side. It uses a fuselage-mounted compressor that powers two contra-rotating rotor-mounted <b>free</b> <b>turbines.</b> These <b>free</b> <b>turbines</b> drive a pair of contrarotating rotors that are fitted with rigid hingeless main rotor blades. This novel rotor drive eliminates the need for either mechanical transmission or a tail rotor. The aim of the REDT concept is to lower the maintenance costs and the accident rate, as well as to extend the flight envelope towards much higher airspeeds compared to classical helicopters...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> {{is that the two}} turbines can operate at different speeds, and that these speeds can vary relative to each other. This is particularly advantageous for varying loads, such as turboprop engines.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid such}} accidents, <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> engines, {{including}} the Proteus, are now commonly {{fitted with a}} device to shut off the fuel supply at the HP cock if torque in the turbine output shaft suddenly falls to zero.|$|E

50|$|The Kuznetsov NK-8 is a two-spool {{turbofan}} engine - with two low pressure turbines driving the fan and {{low pressure compressor}} and one high pressure turbine driving the higher stages of the compressor.As the No. 2 engine's low-pressure shaft failed in the engine due to metal fatigue, the low-pressure turbine become suddenly physically separated from the low-pressure compressor, <b>freeing</b> the <b>turbine.</b> Because the engine combustion chamber was still producing power, the suddenly <b>freed</b> <b>turbine</b> spun out of control with such enormous speed that within {{a fraction of a}} second, the centrifugal force caused the turbine to disintegrate. The enclosure of the turbine failed to contain the pieces of the turbine, which were ejected tangentially at high speed, causing severe damage to the tail section of the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Design of the P.531 {{was started}} in November 1957 as a private venture {{improvement}} of the company's earlier Skeeter. The first prototypes were powered by a derated 325 shp Blackburn Turbomeca Turmo 600, a <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> engine allowing clutchless transmission. The P.531 first flew on 20 July 1958. Three more developed P.531-0s followed and these were delivered to the Royal Navy/Fleet Air Arm for trials and familiarisation. Following evaluation by the Navy a batch of 30 developed aircraft were eventually ordered as the Westland Wasp.|$|E
50|$|An attractively simple {{configuration}} {{making use}} of the <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> is the propfan engine, with a rear-mounted unducted fan in pusher configuration, rather than the more familiar tractor layout. The first such engine was the very early and promising Metropolitan-Vickers F.3 of 1942 with a ducted fan, followed by the unducted and much lighter F.5. Development of these engines stopped abruptly owing to corporate takeovers, rather than technical reasons. Rolls-Royce continued with design studies for such engines into the 1980s, as did GE, but {{they have yet to}} appear as commercial engines.|$|E
50|$|As well {{as being}} one of the first engines to feature a <b>free</b> {{propeller}} <b>turbine,</b> the Theseus was the first turboprop in the world to pass a type test, doing so in January 1947.|$|R
50|$|The Solar T62 Titan is an American gas-turbine engine used {{mainly as}} a {{helicopter}} {{auxiliary power unit}} (APU), ground power generator or helicopter power-plant. A <b>free</b> power <b>turbine</b> version was developed as the Solar T66.|$|R
50|$|A {{single-stage}} turbine {{drives the}} 10 stage all-axial compressor, whilst a two-stage <b>free</b> power <b>turbine</b> drives the load. The combustor is annular. The Gnome {{differed from the}} T-58 in having a British developed fuel control system (Lucas).|$|R
5000|$|Turbine — The turbine is {{a series}} of bladed discs that act like a windmill, extracting energy from the hot gases leaving the combustor. Some of this energy is used to drive the compressor. Turboprop, {{turboshaft}} and turbofan engines have additional turbine stages to drive a propeller, bypass fan or helicopter rotor. In a <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> the turbine driving the compressor rotates independently of that which powers the propellor or helicopter rotor. Cooling air, bled from the compressor, may be used to cool the turbine blades, vanes and discs to allow higher turbine entry gas temperatures for the same turbine material temperatures.** ...|$|E
5000|$|Bluebird CN7 was {{the first}} land speed record vehicle to be powered by a gas turbine engine.The Bristol-Siddeley Proteus was the Bristol Aeroplane Company's first {{successful}} gas turbine engine design, and delivered [...] plus approximately [...] of exhaust thrust. The Proteus was a two spool, reverse flow turboshaft. Because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only a power shaft, this engine is sometimes classified as a <b>free</b> <b>turbine.</b> The engine, a Proteus 705, was specially modified by Bristol's Stanley Hooker to have a power shaft {{at each end of}} the engine. These shafts are connected directly to final drive assemblies with differentials and fixed ratios of 3.6 to 1 providing power to all four wheels via half-shafts.|$|E

40|$|The Rankine {{compression}} {{gas turbine}} (RCG) {{is a new}} type of combined cycle, i. e. combined steam and gas turbine installation, that returns all shaft power on one <b>free</b> power <b>turbine.</b> The novelty of the RCG is that the steam turbine drives the compressor of the gas turbine cycle. This way, the turbine of the gas turbine acts as a <b>free</b> power <b>turbine.</b> With its <b>free</b> power <b>turbine</b> the possible field of application of the RCG is mechanical drives. The RCG can be designed with components that can all be referred to as existing technology, which makes the RCG robust and technologically feasible. Thermodynamic calculations show that a thermal efficiency of about 40 % is realistic. This is higher than simple cycle gas turbines, and equal to gas turbines with a recuperator. The calculations also show that the specific power of an RCG is up to twice as high than that of both simple cycle and recuperative cycle gas turbines. Finally, economical assessments show that the extra investments of an RCG compared to a simple cycle have an expected payback time of 2 – 4 years. This makes the RCG economically appealing, but further study is necessary to obtain more exact figures on the economical feasibility...|$|R
50|$|Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine is {{a design}} {{spin-off}} from the Kaveri engine, designed for Indian combat aircraft. Using {{the core of}} the Kaveri engine, GTRE added low-pressure compressor and turbine as a gas generator and designed a <b>free</b> power <b>turbine</b> to generate shaft power for maritime applications.|$|R
50|$|General Electric's GE36 Unducted Fan was a {{variation}} on the original propfan concept, and appears similar to a pusher configuration piston engine. GE's UDF had a novel direct-drive arrangement, where the reduction gearbox was replaced by a low-speed seven-stage <b>free</b> <b>turbine.</b> One set of turbine rotors drove the forward set of propellers, while the rear set was driven by the other set of rotors which rotated in the opposite direction. The turbine had 14 blade rows with seven stages. Each stage was a pair of contra-rotating rows. Boeing intended to offer GE's pusher UDF engine on the 7J7 platform, and McDonnell Douglas was going to do likewise on their MD-94X airliner. The GE36 was first flight tested mounted on the #3 engine station of a Boeing 727-100 in 1986.|$|E
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> design was {{the ease with which}} a counter-rotating engine could be designed and manufactured, simply by reversing the power turbine alone. This allowed handed engines to be made in pairs, when needed. It also allowed contra-rotating engines, where gas generator core and power turbine revolved in opposite directions, reducing the overall moment of inertia. For the helicopter engine replacement market, this ability allowed previous engines of either direction to be replaced simply. Some turboshaft engines' omni-angle freedom of their installation angle also allowed installation into existing helicopter designs, no matter how the previous engines had been arranged. In time though, the move towards axial LP compressors and so smaller diameter engines encouraged a move to the now standard layout of one or two engines set side-by-side, horizontally above the cabin.|$|E
50|$|Oddly, {{they then}} {{suggested}} that any engine core developed for this role {{should also be}} suitable for aviation use, {{which led to the}} abandonment of the rotating injectors after all, and eventually to the use of a modified BMW 003 core, from a well-proven design. The basic layout had to be modified {{with the addition of a}} third bearing near the middle of the engine to help absorb shock loads, and a third turbine stage was added to the end of the engine to harness more torque. Unlike the earlier design, the power-take off could be placed anywhere (not just off the <b>free</b> <b>turbine</b> stage) and was in fact moved to the front of the engine in order to make the design as compatible as possible with existing engine compartments. The basic design was completed in mid-November, and assigned the name GT 101.|$|E
50|$|In most designs, the gas {{generator}} and power section are mechanically separate so they can each rotate at different speeds appropriate for the conditions, {{referred to as a}} 'free power turbine'. A <b>free</b> power <b>turbine</b> can be an extremely useful design feature for vehicles, as it allows the design to forgo the weight and cost of complex multiple-ratio transmissions and clutches.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{to an open}} <b>turbine</b> in <b>free</b> stream, ducted <b>turbines</b> {{are capable}} {{of as much as}} 3 to 4 times the power of the same turbine rotor in open flow.|$|R
50|$|The Gem's three-shaft engine {{configuration}} {{is rather}} unusual for turboshaft/turboprop engines. Basic arrangement is a four-stage axial LP (Low Pressure) compressor, {{driven by a}} single stage LP turbine, supercharging a centrifugal HP (High Pressure) compressor, driven by a single stage HP turbine. Power is delivered to the load via a third shaft, connected to a two-stage <b>free</b> (power) <b>turbine.</b> A reverse flow combustor is featured.|$|R
