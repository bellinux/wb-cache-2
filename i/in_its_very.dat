25|$|The {{sequencing}} of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity {{that had not}} been appreciated before.

However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{original}} Senators, success was quick, winning the Eastern League championship <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> first season. In 1991, affiliation {{shifted from the}} Pittsburgh Pirates to the Montreal Expos, an affiliation continuing through that team's move to Washington, D.C. The first several years of affiliation with Montreal brought consecutive championships from 1996 to 1998. In 1999, the Senators played the Norwich Navigators for a shot at their record-setting fourth consecutive Eastern League Championship. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning of game 5, the Senators trailed by 3 runs, but with 2 outs, the bases loaded, and a full count Milton Bradley hit a walk-off grand slam to right center field to win the fourth straight championship for the Senators, an Eastern League first.

The Yankees are the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Big Red Machine in four straight.

25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on his lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E
25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> {{favourable}} reception {{by critics}} {{and in the}} way that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing fast and loose with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

25|$|Several encyclicals {{addressed}} the Eastern Catholic Churches. Orientalis Ecclesiae was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary {{of the death}} of Cyril of Alexandria, a saint common to Eastern Christianity and Latin Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. Orientales omnes Ecclesias, issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the Ruthenian Church, threatened <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. Sempiternus Rex was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to Miaphysite theology to return to the Catholic Church. Orientales Ecclesias was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued Stalinist persecution of the Church. Several Apostolic Letters were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in Fulgens corona, as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.|$|E
500|$|Others {{agree on}} the {{strength}} of Frost at Midnight. Richard Holmes wrote in 1989 that the poem [...] "is one of the most intricately structured of all the Conversation Poems". Rosemary Ashton argued in 1997 that the poem is [...] "one of [...] most delightful conversation poems". Agreeing with this view in 2006, Adam Sisman believes that Frost at Midnight is [...] "perhaps the most beautiful of Coleridge's 'conversation poems'". Other poems in the series received praise, with George Watson, in 1966, claiming that To William Wordsworth [...] "is the last pure example that Coleridge's poetry affords of the conversation poem [...] the poem is extravagant <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> being." [...] Also, Holmes describes The Eolian Harp as a [...] "beautiful Conversation Poem".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>very</b> heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
