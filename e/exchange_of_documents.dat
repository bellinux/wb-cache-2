5000|$|The {{final report}} of the CIAC was {{presented}} in November 2008; among its arguments were the declaration of [...] "illegitimacy" [...] to the commercial tranches and the need of recognizing the joint responsibly comprehended in managing the debt, the annulment of illegitimate obligations and the compensation for the damages caused. President, Rafael Correa, declared on 12 December the moratorium of the external debt, on the tranche of Global bonds 2012 and 2030. Global bonds 2010 represented a capital of 510 million dollars. In February 2009, he likewise declared the moratorium on Global bonds 2030; they added up to a capital of 2,700 million dollars. With this declaration, Correa undertook {{the definition of a}} proposal directed to creditors, despite the warnings from the market analysts that the country would suffer the terrible consequences of having refused to pay the debt when it had all the necessary resources in order to do so.The market speculated on the scope of Ecuador’s plan. Options revolved around the renegotiation, restructuration, repurchase, <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> among others. The official proposal was presented on 20 April 2009; it consisted on repurchasing the bonds in circulation for up to 35 cents of their nominal values (price ceiling), appealing to an inverse reverse auction mechanism, by which the owed amount reduced just as the due date for closing the operation got closer. Ecuador finally announced, on June of the same year, that through the operation it had repurchased the bonds with a discount of up to 70 per cent. According to reports from the Minister of Finance of that time, Elsa Viteri, the net savings that came from this operation were 2,000 million dollars. However, when adding the savings concerning the service of the bonds, if their original settlement due date had arrived, the country saved 7,500 million dollars, according to Viteri. Ecuador, buy means of the repurchase and other actions concerning the management of its public debt, succeeded in lowering the service of its external obligations from almost the 40% to the 22% of the General Budget of the State. The balance of the debt reduced, in net terms, by more than 3,000 million and the service by 331.2 million dollars a year. With these achievements, during the last five years, social investment grew significantly from 1,980 to 5,197 million dollars between 2006 and 2011. Poverty, at national scale, decreased from 37.6% to 28.6%, during the same years. Rural poverty was reduced from 60.6 to 50.9 per cent.

40|$|Negotiation in {{traditional}} commerce {{is a complex}} communication process. Research in negotiation support for electronic commerce has focused on new negotiation protocols such as auctions. However, for peer-to-peer negotiations in business-to-business electronic commerce such protocols are inappropriate. In this paper we present a novel approach to the effective support of electronic negotiations. Existing negotiation processes {{in traditional}} commerce are analysed {{to find out about}} negotiation patterns and to anticipate potential problems. Our aim is to exploit the potential of information technology to overcome (most of) these problems for electronic negotiations. Electronic negotiations between business partners involve the <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and messages. Documents are contracts which evolve during the negotiations. The evolution is coordinated through the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> structured messages such as offers, requests, quotations, counteroffers, and acceptances. In contrast to the current practice of separate management <b>of</b> messages and <b>documents,</b> we propose a powerful framework for effective negotiation support in electronic commerce by combining communication and document management. ...|$|R
