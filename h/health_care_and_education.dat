5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill.

They drafted the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E

5|$|However, the BC NDP {{were deeply}} unpopular within the province, {{reaching}} a low at 15% support in opinion polls {{at the time}} of Glen Clark's resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>education,</b> and Dosanjh's personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote, on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} obstacle was {{a pivotal}} group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant {{to support the}} bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, {{but they could not}} address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment. This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage. The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it. The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill. Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010. Since passage, Republicans have voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act over sixty times; no such attempt by Republicans has been successful. The amendment bill, The <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> Reconciliation Act, cleared the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.|$|E
