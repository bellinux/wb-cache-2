25|$|As for the Chargers, the {{implications}} of their defeat were worse in hindsight as this remains as the only Super Bowl the Chargers had ever played in and including the pre AFL-NFL merger, the 3rd championship game the Chargers lost, since they previously won the AFL Championship in 1963. That championship remains to this day as the only major sports championship the city of San Diego has won (and also the longest championship drought for any city that has at least two major sports franchises), so {{even though they were}} heavy underdogs, the loss still had a great significance. The Chargers would also not win another playoff game since then until the 2007 season, when they reached the AFC Championship, but lost to the then 18-0 New England Patriots, 21–12. This remains the closest the Chargers <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> returning to the Super Bowl as of the 2016 season. Super Bowl XXIX would be their only appearance while playing in San Diego, before they moved to Los Angeles following the 2016 season.|$|E
500|$|The {{strain of}} {{this seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> Phips {{in a way that}} so many {{previous}} seemingly insurmountable challenges had not. In January 1693, Phips was involved in an embarrassing and unseemly physical altercation with his subordinate captain in the royal navy, Richard Short. Their accusations against each other in letters to Whitehall follow the standard lines of the Tarpaulin vs. Gentleman. Short is called a drunk, corrupt, unwilling to withstand hardships or obey direct orders. His lieutenant captain is accused of cowardice. Phips, as usual, is accused of having only a carpenter's education, poor manners, disregarding standard procedure (reminiscent of the journal of Knepp). [...] Phips pick for a replacement captain, Dobbins, is accused of the same. Phips is also accused of corruption, which was a standard charge, and a standard problem for colonial leadership at this time, but Phips having traded silver for paper after the fiasco of Quebec, and building his own ship to chase pirates in Maine, seems to take the teeth out of this accusation.|$|E
2500|$|While outsiders thought Taft was {{the epitome}} of {{conservative}} Republicanism, inside the party, he was repeatedly criticized by hardliners alarmed by his sponsorship of New Deal-like programs, especially federal housing for the poor. The real estate lobby was especially fearful about public housing. [...] Senator Kenneth S. Wherry discerned a [...] "touch of socialism" [...] in Taft, and his Ohio colleague, Senator John Bricker, speculated that perhaps the [...] "socialists <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> Bob Taft." [...] The distrust on the right hurt Taft's 1948 presidential ambitions.|$|E

Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in our heads and got on (record).

I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself. If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington.

"Kinsman," [...] she said, [...] "you are welcome--and you, too, stranger," [...] she added, {{releasing}} my alarmed companion, who instinctively {{drew back}} and settled his wig, and addressing herself to me--"you also are welcome. You came," [...] she added, [...] "to our unhappy country, when our bloods were chafed, and our hands were red. Excuse the rudeness that {{gave you a}} rough welcome, and lay it upon the evil times, and not upon us." [...] All this was said with the manners of a princess, and in the tone and style of a court. Nor was there the least tincture of that vulgarity, which we naturally attach to the Lowland Scottish. There was a strong provincial accentuation, but, otherwise, the language rendered by Helen MacGregor, out of the native and poetical Gaelic, into English, which she had acquired as we do learned tongues, but had probably never heard applied to the mean purposes of ordinary life, was graceful, flowing, and declamatory. Her husband, who had in his time played many parts, used a much less elevated and emphatic dialect;--but even his language rose in purity of expression, {{as you may have}} remarked, if I have been accurate in recording it, when the affairs which he discussed were of an agitating and important nature; and it appears to me in his case, and in that of some other Highlanders whom I have known, that, when familiar and facetious, they used the Lowland Scottish dialect,--when serious and impassioned, their thoughts arranged themselves in the idiom of their native language; and in the latter case, as they uttered the corresponding ideas in English, the expressions sounded wild, elevated, and poetical. In fact, the language of passion is almost always pure as well as vehement, and it is no uncommon thing to hear a Scotchman, when overwhelmed by a countryman with a tone of bitter and fluent upbraiding, reply by way of taunt to his adversary, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> your English." ...|$|E
