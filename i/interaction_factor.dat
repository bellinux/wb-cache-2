Then look at the competitive <b>interaction</b> <b>factor</b> (CIF) and the effective toxicant concentration (ETC) of the metals—then effective toxicantconcentration is compared to laboratory observations.

50|$|The {{perpetuation of}} self-objectification can be {{described}} as a cycle. Objectification causes self-objectification which perpetuates objectification, or causes it to continue, and the cycle goes on. Both media and social <b>interaction</b> <b>factor</b> into that cycle as well. Media is everywhere, plastering seemingly perfect women across billboards, in music videos, and on covers of magazines. These ideals cause people to put on an unrealistic lens, thinking that they should look and act like the women in the media are portrayed, perpetuating the cycle of self-objectification. Social interactions affect this cycle as well, as the way people communicate with each other subconsciously furthers objectification as well. This type of talk is known as appearance related communication. Two types of appearance related communication that have had an effect on the existence of self-objectification are fat talk and old talk.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{recognizes that}} soil {{layering}} {{may have a}} profound effect on the settlement of pile groups and that pile-to-pile interaction induces not only additional settlement at the head of each pile but also additional stresses along its shaft. A general analytical formulation is developed, based on the Winkler model of soil reaction, for determining the vertical <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> between two piles embedded in multilayered soil. It is shown that such <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> depend not only on the displacement field arising from the settlement of a loaded ('source') pile but also on the interplay between the adjacent ('receiver') pile and the soil subjected to this displacement field. Such interplay, which has not been considered (at least explicitly) in currently available simple methods, is quantified here through an analytically determined factor zeta, which lies between 0 and 1, The paper also develops closed-form expressions for pile stiffness and <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> in a two-layer stratum, and highlights crucial aspects of the problem...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the mixed-design ANOVA uses both between-subject {{variables}} and within-subject variables (a.k.a. repeated measures), it is necessary to partition out (or separate) the between-subject effects and the within-subject effects. [...] It is as if you are running two separate ANOVAs with the same data set, except that it is possible to examine the interaction of the two effects in a mixed design. As can be seen in the source table provided below, the between-subject variables can be partitioned into the main effect of the first factor and into the error term. The within-subjects terms can be partitioned into three terms: the second (within-subjects) factor, the interaction term for the first and second factors, and the error term. The main difference between the sum of squares of the within-subject factors and between-subject factors is that within-subject factors have an <b>interaction</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Wegscheider {{conditions}} {{follow from}} {{the principle of}} detailed balance and the second law of thermodynamics. They constrain possible values of the kinetic parameters in reaction networks. A mathematical model that violates these conditions describes a thermodynamically impossible system. Large reaction networks contain usually {{a large number of}} Wegscheider conditions. This makes the thermodynamically consistent, kinetic modeling of such networks difficult. For this reason we developed the Thermodynamic-Kinetic Modeling (TKM) formalism, that provides a structurally consistent parameterization of kinetic models (Ederer & Gilles, Biophys J, 92 (6), 2007). The parameters of the TKM approach are capacities of species and resistances of reactions. Networks that model the formation of multi-protein complexes contain a particularly high number of Wegscheider conditions. Since the formation of protein complexes is a central motif of cellular signal transduction, we will show how the TKM formalism can be applied to such networks. Results: The thermokinetic capacities of protein complexes can be written by a product of a base capacity with <b>interaction</b> <b>factors.</b> The <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> depend on the binding energies of the proteins. Higher order <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> are possible, if more than two proteins interact. In a similar way, thermokinetic resistances can be decomposed into a base resistance and <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> that describe the influence of the binding state of the participating proteins. This decomposition of capacities and resistances allows us to formulate a thermokinetic model in a rule-based manner. Conclusions: Kinetic models that describe the formation of protein complexes are prone to a violation of the Wegscheider conditions. The Thermodynamic-Kinetic Modeling (TKM) formalism provides a thermodynamically consistent and intuitive parameterization of such networks by capacitive and resistive <b>interaction</b> <b>factors.</b> It allows for a rule-based formulation of thermokinetic models. This is important since due to the combinatorial complexity of protein complexation, the number of occurring species and reactions increases exponentially with the number of proteins. © 2008 University of Göteborg [accessed December 22, 2008...|$|R

The moderation effect of gender and ethnicity is investigated. A total of 454 high school HAVO and VWO students from The Netherlands participated in this study. They completed the Level of Expressed Emotion (LEE) questionnaire, the scale of Family cohesion from the Leuven Family Questionnaire and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). This study demonstrates that family <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> are no predictors for social phobia symptoms among adolescents. The level of social phobia symptoms is an indicator for the level of social phobia symptoms at a later moment. A negative relation occurs between expressed emotions and social phobia on both measurements. The development of the family <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> is stable over time, whereas the social phobia symptoms decline. There is no moderation effect of gender and ethnicity.

The capacity of the pile foundation to resist static and dynamic loads depends {{on the behavior of}} the piles which, in turn, is a product of pile-soil-pile interaction.;Dynamic analysis of pile groups is very recent and rather complex while corresponding experimental data are limited.;Field dynamic experiments and limited static tests with a large group of 102 piles are described and results are presented in order to verify the linear theories accounting for pile-soil-pile interaction.;The experimental data for vertical and horizontal excitation are compared with the theoretical predictions {{made on the basis of}} different approaches that account for the group effect, namely; static <b>interaction</b> <b>factors,</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> <b>factors,</b> complete dynamic solution, direct static analysis and the equivalent pier. The comparison suggests that dynamic analytical techniques are able to predict the main features of dynamic behavior of pile groups, but tend to overestimate damping, i. e., underestimate the response. In addition to the difficulty involved in calculating the static <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> for large groups, the approach may underestimate the stiffness and does not yield any estimate of group geometric damping.;A method is formulated which avoids the use of the <b>interaction</b> <b>factors</b> while remaining simple and is computationally very efficient, facilitating a fast inexpensive computer analysis of very large pile groups. The method presented allows for an arbitrary soil profile, pile type and configuration, evaluates group stiffness, forces on individual piles and material damping making it suitable for static and low frequency dynamic loading.

40|$|AbstractIn {{structures}} to support large {{vertical and horizontal}} loads, piles are usually used {{in the form of}} closely spaced group. The piles in a group are not only affected by their individual loads transmitted from the pile cap, but also by additional loads transferred through the soil from the interference of neighboring piles. This group interaction influences the group stiffness, load-transfer mechanism and group settlement. In order to predict the response characteristics of pile groups, the interaction factors calculated using Mindlin's solution based on the theory of elasticity has been widely applied. The pile-to-pile <b>interaction</b> <b>factor</b> is defined as the ratio of displacements or rotations of an unloaded receiver pile to those of neighboring loaded source pile due to soil deformation. In this paper, a series of centrifuge model tests were carried out to examine the effect of soil relative density and pile spacing and pile tip condition on the <b>interaction</b> <b>factor</b> between two adjacent piles. Based on the results, soil relative density has a significant effect on the interaction between piles and thus it must be considered in the calculation of <b>interaction</b> <b>factor.</b> For this purpose, a correction to the Randolph and Wroth equation based on the test results was proposed in which the effect of soil relative density is contemplated. With an increase in the pile spacing, the value of <b>interaction</b> <b>factor</b> for all cases decreased. Compared to the effect of pile shaft, pile tip condition has a little effect on the <b>interaction</b> <b>factor.</b> The obtained results were also compared with those from a three-dimensional finite element analysis and a good agreement between the measured and the calculated results was observed...|$|E
