5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the <b>differential</b> <b>heating</b> between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the <b>differential</b> <b>heating</b> between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. <b>Differential</b> <b>heating</b> from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
40|$|CO {{adsorption}} microcalorimetry {{was employed}} {{in the study of}} gamma-Al 2 O 3 -supported Pt, Pt-Sn and Pt-Fe catalysts. The results indicated that the initial <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO adsorption of the Pt/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was 125 kJ/mol. As CO coverage increased, the <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of adsorption decreased. At higher coverages, the <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of adsorption decreased significantly. 60 % of the <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO adsorption on the Pt/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was higher than 100 kJ/mol. No significant effect on the initial <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> was found after adding Sn and Fe to the Pt/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The amount of strong CO adsorption sites decreased, while the portion of CO adsorption sites with <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of 60 - 110 kJ/mol increased after increasing the Sn or Fe content. This indicates that the surface adsorption energy was changed by adding Sn or Fe to Pt/gamma-Al 2 O 3. The distribution of <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO adsorption on the PI-Sn(C) /gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was broad and homogeneous. Comparison of the dehydrogenation performance of C- 4 alkanes with the number of CO adsorption sites with <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of 60 - 110 kJ/mol showed a good correlation. These results indicate that the surface Pt centers with <b>differential</b> <b>heats</b> of 60 - 110 kJ/mol for CO adsorption possess superior activity for the dehydrogenation of alkanes...|$|R

The vapor sorption isotherm and the <b>differential</b> <b>heats</b> of sorption were determined simultaneously from dry condition to a water activity of 0. 99.

Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins.

25|$|Also {{known as}} the thermal theory or the <b>differential</b> <b>heating</b> of sea and land theory, the {{traditional}} theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale sea breeze. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive landmass of the Indian Peninsula heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a pressure gradient from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling adiabatically and leading to orographic rains. This is the southwest monsoon.|$|E
25|$|The discs are {{commonly}} made from cast iron {{and a certain}} amount of surface rust is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of <b>differential</b> <b>heating</b> between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.|$|E

40|$|Herein, the {{development}} of an improved Pd on carbon nitride catalyst for the direct H 2 O 2 synthesis from the elements is reported. Microcalorimetric CO chemisorption is used for characterizing the chemical speciation of the Pd selective and unselective sites. Selectivity trends among the samples suggest that a bare metal surface with a <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO chemisorption ranging between 140 and 120 kJ*mol - 1 is responsible for the total O 2 hydrogenation, while a maximum threshold value of <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO chemisorption of approximately 70 kJ*mol - 1 is necessary for the partial hydrogenation of O 2 to H 2 O 2. Such low <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of CO chemisorption indicates a low exposed metallic Pd surface subjected to electron-withdrawing from the surrounding ligands, i. e. the N functional group on the carbon support. With respect to N-containing carbon nanotubes, carbon nitrides provide: higher concentration of N sites; a flexible network of π-conjugated polymeric subunits with sp 3 linking subunits; a flakes-like morphology with high exposure of reactive C edge terminations.

The linear and mono-branched isomers adsorb well, but 2, 2 -dimethylbutane is totally excluded. Plotting the <b>differential</b> <b>heat</b> of adsorption against the loading shows an initial plateau for n-hexane and 2 -methylpentane.
