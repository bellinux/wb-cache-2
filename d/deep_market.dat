40|$|Redox flow {{batteries}} (RFBs) {{have emerged}} as prime candidates for energy storage on the medium and large scales, particularly at the grid scale. The demand for versatile energy storage continues to increase as more electrical energy is generated from intermittent renewable sources. A major barrier {{in the way of}} broad deployment and <b>deep</b> <b>market</b> penetration is the use of expensive metals as the active species in the electrolytes. The use of organic redox couples in aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes is a promising approach to reducing the overall cost in long-term, since these materials can be low-cost and abundant. The performance of such redox couples can be tuned by modifying their chemical structure. In recent years, significant developments in organic redox flow batteries has taken place, with the introduction of new groups of highly soluble organic molecules, capable of providing a cell voltage and charge capacity comparable to conventional metal-based systems. This review summarises the fundamental developments and characterization of organic redox flow batteries from both the chemistry and materials perspectives. The latest advances, future challenges and opportunities for further development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{move away}} from the present socialist {{dictatorship}} in Cuba could mean adopting a hybrid economic system that incorporates a large measure of state control of the economy with some market liberalization. Alternatively, it could mean quick broad and <b>deep</b> <b>market</b> opening and the effective establishment of the institutions needed for efficient resource allocation by the market. Only through radical change, as in the latter alternative, will Cuba be able to achieve economic development and benefit from a full integration into the international economy. In this chapter I explore the political pressures likely to arise in a post-Castro Cuba, the institutional and policy reform measures needed for a successful transition to a market economy and democracy, and the way those measures should be implemented. One central proposition advanced is that a post-Castro government will have to mobilize a critical minimum mass of popular support to make the reform measures it adopts sustainable. In the following section I present a stylized model of how key constituencies are likely to react to a reform process. Then, using such model for reference purposes, I elaborate on the required policy approach...|$|E

40|$|Significant advancements {{have been}} made towards the commercialization of polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane (PEM) fuel cells in recent years. However, prohibitive costs and limited durability still remain as barriers toward <b>deep</b> <b>market</b> penetration, and these challenges largely stem from an incomplete {{understanding of how the}} nanoscale and microscale features of the porous materials in the PEM fuel cell affect multiphase and thermal transport within the bulk and at the interfacial regions of these porous layers. Non-traditional tools are needed more than ever to address these challenges. In the Thermofluids for Energy and Advanced Materials (TEAM) Laboratory at the University of Toronto, we employ a variety of advanced visualization tools to characterize the nanoscale and microscale features of the porous layers of the PEM fuel cell within ex-situ and in-situ environments. Accurate material characterizations are used as inputs for developing our predictive models, and visualizations serve as validations for our numerical modelling work. Our goal is to develop predictive numerical models that will serve as design tools that we can use to prescribe three-dimensional material properties for tailored thermal and liquid water transport {{for the next generation of}} PEM fuel cell technologies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{general equilibrium model}} to analyze the link between financial imbalances and financial crises. The model features an interbank market subject to frictions and where two equilibria may (co-) exist. The normal times equilibrium {{is characterized by a}} <b>deep</b> <b>market</b> with highly leveraged banks. The crisis times equilibrium is characterized by bank deleveraging, a market run, and a liquidity trap. Crises occur when there is too much liquidity (savings) in the economy with respect to the number of (safe) investment opportunities. In effect, the economy is shown to have a limited liquidity absorption capacity, which depends 2 ̆ 014 inter alia 2 ̆ 014 on the productivity of the real sector, the ultimate borrower. I extend the model in order to analyze the effects of financial integration of an emerging and a developed country. I find results in line with the recent literature on global imbalances. Financial integration permits a more efficient allocation of savings worldwide in normal times. It also implies a current account deficit for the developed country. The current account deficit makes financial crises more likely when it exceeds the liquidity absorption capacity of the developed country. Thus, under some conditions 2 ̆ 014 which this paper spells out 2 ̆ 014 financial integration of emerging countries may increase the fragility of the international financial system. Implications of financial integration and global imbalances in terms of output, wealth distribution, welfare, and policy interventions are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A <b>deep</b> <b>market</b> {{analysis}} on the regional and commuter aircraft has revealed that nowadays the volatility of oil price (more and more prone to international political crises), the huge growth of air transport traffic and the increasing attention to the aircraft environmental footprint considerably lead the interest of specialists towards new configurations of regional and commuter transport aircraft. Also the major airlines in this segment have been addressing the replacement for many hundreds of heritage airplanes in the 20 - 150 seats categories currently in service around the world. Turboprop configuration could be the ideal answer to this request. An innovative turboprop configuration with a rear propeller installation {{can lead to a}} cleaner wing with possibilities to achieve laminar flow extension. In addition the wing without engine nacelle and free of propeller interference effects will be characterized by a more efficient high-lift system with a possible increase in aircraft maximum lift coefficient which will positively affect the ground performances. The analysis of the proposed innovative configuration with rear propeller installation, {{which is one of the}} main topics dealt by the IRON project proposal, is characterized by several aerodynamic, performance and propulsion feature that must be predicted with high accuracy and deep comprehension of involved phenomena in order to lead to a possible improved configuration respect to the classical configuration with wing-mounted engines. The IRON project will also address the conventional (wing mounted propeller) turboprop configuration. In this case one of the key element is the reduction of the perceived annoyance due to propeller noise emissions. A low-noise propeller system will be designed after exploring emerging technologies. This achievement will be attained while preserving the propulsion efficiency because of its high impact on economic, environmental and social issues...|$|E
