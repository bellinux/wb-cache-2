25|$|Worm gears {{resemble}} <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> seats, {{the difference}} {{being that the}} shafts of a worm train are aligned perpendicularly. In this case, the helix angle of the worm meshes with the lead angle of the worm gear.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal milling machine except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.|$|E
40|$|Crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> have {{important}} advantages, {{that they are}} easy to produce and assemble without influenced by mounting errors in center distance and shaft angle. On the other hand the crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> fail mainly by scuffing. Power transmission of crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> is low, since the Hertzian pressure in the small elliptic contact area is very high and the sliding velocity between contacting tooth surfaces is very high compared with other kind of gears. The basic research relating to the load carrying character-istics of crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> is extremely scarce. In this paper we showed the general relationships concerning the limiting load for scuffing and tooth profiles. Some new ways of improving the load carrying capacity of crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> are also shown...|$|R

A new topology of tooth surfaces of <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> that enables a favorable bearing contact and a reduced level of vibration is described. Methods for grinding of the <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> with the new topology are proposed. A TCA (tooth contact analysis) program for simulation of meshing and contact of <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> with the new topology has been developed. Numerical examples that illustrate the proposed ideas are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{investigations}} on crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> {{have been}} accumulated over years. However experimental studies on load carrying character-istics are extremely scarce. Crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> are engaged geometrically in a point contact between two tooth surfaces, so the Hertzian {{pressure on the}} tooth surface is comparatively high, and the sliding velocity is also high, resulting the limiting load for scuffing is low and wear is comparatively high. Although crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> can transmit only light loads, they have many advantageous features; {{they are easy to}} produce and assemble. In this study, we investigated limiting load for scuffing of spur gears, hypoid <b>gears</b> and crossed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> for comparison. We also investigated the effect of the lubricating oil on scuffing load characteristics...|$|R
25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the <b>helical</b> <b>gear.</b> The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Replacement of {{the steam}} engines began in 1922, {{starting}} at Whitworth Street. Four [...] pumping engines were removed {{and replaced by}} electrically driven centrifugal pumps. The work was completed by 1924. The following year, the remaining [...] pumps were retained, but their steam cylinders were removed, and the flywheels replaced by a <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> drive, to connect the pumps to [...] electric motors. These were variable speed direct current devices, and a motor converter set had to be installed, to provide the low voltage DC supply from the incoming high voltage alternating current supply. The motor converter set was built in 1914, and was second-hand. The pumps at the Water Street station were converted to electrical operation {{in a similar manner}} soon afterwards.|$|E

The increase in pitch line velocities and tooth loadings has not been without problems. Several new and updated American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) standards have been published to educate end users on the issues with high-speed <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> and to provide consistent criteria for rating gears.

The approach {{is applied to}} double circular arc <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> and modified involute <b>helical</b> <b>gears.</b> The reduction of noise and vibration is achieved by application of a predesigned parabolic function of transmission errors that is able to absorb a discontinuous linear function of transmission errors caused by misalignment. The localization of the bearing contact is achieved by the mismatch of pinion-gear tooth surfaces. Computerized simulation of meshing and contact of the designed gears demonstrated that the proposed approach will produce a pair of gears that has a parabolic transmission error function even when misalignment is present. Numerical examples for illustration of the developed approach are given...|$|R

The approaches proposed for modification of conventional involute <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> {{are based on}} conjugation of double-crowned pinion with a conventional <b>helical</b> involute <b>gear.</b> Double-crowning of the pinion means deviation of cross-profile from an involute one and deviation in longitudinal direction from a helicoid surface. Using the method developed, the pinion-gear tooth surfaces are in point-contact, the bearing contact is localized and oriented longitudinally, and edge contact is avoided. Also, the influence of errors of aligment on the shift of bearing contact, vibration, and noise are reduced substantially.
