5|$|Infanticide {{exists in}} {{numerous}} rodent species {{and may be}} practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, {{in the case of}} males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or <b>early</b> <b>termination</b> of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} primary mutant alleles of dbt: dbtS, which shortens the organism's {{free-running}} period (its internal period in constant light conditions); dbtL, which lengthens the free-running period; and dbtP, which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and per and tim transcription.

DbtS PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, {{which suggests that}} dbtS {{does not affect the}} clock through this degradation mechanism.

25|$|A {{number of}} small {{molecules}} that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development. One approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the stop codon and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF results from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to <b>early</b> <b>termination</b> of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target nonsense mutations such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid glycine in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome a premature stop codon by inserting a random amino acid, thereby allowing expression of a full-length protein.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative study (WHI), {{which was}} {{designed}} to demonstrate additional benefits for conventional hormone therapy (study participants were given Prempro or a placebo), was terminated prematurely after preliminary data indicated small increases in the risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in older women using Prempro. The <b>early</b> <b>termination</b> of the WHI study (which used conjugated equine estrogens) and the subsequent publicity about these previously unappreciated risks led to a decline in prescriptions for CHRT. The results of the WHI were used by BHRT prescribers to promote bioidentical hormones as safer than the FDA-regulated preparations despite a lack of evidence; according to the FDA, the results found by the study apply to all estrogens. BHRT has since been strongly promoted as a natural alternative with fewer risks than CHRT, though {{there is no evidence to}} support this claim. BHRT practitioners recommend compounded products due to their claim that they more closely mimic the composition and ratio of circulating hormones in a woman's body than do commercially manufactured products.|$|E

30|$|<b>Early</b> search <b>termination</b> {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to further reduce the computational cost of fast motion estimation. Usually, a condition of <b>early</b> search <b>termination</b> is to compare the sum of absolute difference (SAD) value of a current search point with the threshold value. If the SAD value is less than the threshold value, the current search point is considered as the minimum point, and the search is immediately stopped without examining the remaining search points. Ismail mentioned that <b>early</b> stop search <b>termination</b> of a search process could reduce the number of computations [8]. In [4], a constant threshold was used for <b>early</b> search <b>termination.</b> Tourapis proposed an adaptive method in that the threshold value of the current block is determined among the minimum SAD values of the three adjacent blocks [5]. Ismail [9] proposed a dynamic <b>early</b> stop search <b>termination</b> (DESST) by considering a SAD value of an initial search center (ISC) of a current block and the average SAD values of ISCs in all the previous coded blocks. These methods determine the threshold value from SAD values of blocks spatially and temporally adjacent to the current block. Since motion fields of consecutive frames are smooth and gentle [9], they can efficiently judge a block to be stationary or not using the determined threshold. For the stationary blocks, they can terminate early the motion search. However, for the non-stationary blocks, the threshold value predicted from SAD values of blocks spatially and temporally neighboring to the current block is inadequate. Hence, while these methods significantly increase the performance, the determined threshold value {{may not be the best}} for every block.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wilderness Discovery (WD), {{a seven-day}} {{wilderness}} experience {{program designed to}} empower and strengthen the skills and motivation of youth-at-risk in the Federal Job Corps, was tested in 46 trips at four Federal Job Corps Centers (JCCs). Student journals and exit interviews showed that Job Corps students learned valuable lessons from WD: (1) that {{they said they would}} use to improve communication with other students and authority figures; (2) a more positive attitude toward Job Corps; and (3) a sense of accomplishment. WD participants were matched with control groups revealing that WD reduced <b>early</b> <b>terminations</b> 35 % at Curlew JCC in 1993, and an average reduction of 23 % at three centers in 1994. Steering committees at each center came to consensus on many positive benefits of WD, which were then linked to five critical variables in a benefit/cost model developed for Job Corps by Mathematics (1985). Based on all the study evidence, modest adjustments of 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % were made in critical variables of the model to simulate potential economic benefits which exceeded costs of WD, as an adjunct to Job Corps. This analysis and framework helps document the idea that in designing a wilderness program around desired outcomes, in this case reducing <b>early</b> <b>terminations</b> and enhancing employability of JCC students, and designing analysis of these outcomes, wilderness experiencesmay be justified for economic reasons. title coauthor Keith Russell.
