5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E

5|$|Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a non-fiction {{book about}} the American airline {{industry}} and Federal Aviation Administration, written by Mary Schiavo with Sabra Chartrand. The book {{was first published in}} March 1997 in hardcover format by Avon Books. An updated paperback edition was published on April 1, 1998. Schiavo is a former Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation, and Chartrand a journalist for The New York Times. Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for six years, and resigned in 1996 shortly after the ValuJet Flight 592 airline crash in the Florida Everglades. She became a whistleblower and was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airline industry and its relationship with aviation safety agencies in the United States federal government.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E

5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and some also entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred {{the congregation}} to move farther from England.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured £100,000. The historian David Starkey was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry's {{attitude}} to his service. In 1937 several exercises {{were carried out}} by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite {{the experiences of the}} First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. These remarks were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen, was later added to the tour. The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Alexandre Banza (10 October 1932– 12 April 1969) was a {{military}} officer and politician in the Central African Republic. Born in Carnot, Ubangi-Shari, Banza served with the French Army during the First Indochina War before joining the Central African Republic armed forces. As commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in 1965, Banza helped Jean-Bédel Bokassa overthrow the government of President David Dacko. Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and minister of finance in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations with other countries. In 1967, Bokassa and his protégé had a major argument over the president's extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as minister of finance. Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza {{made a number of}} remarks <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position.|$|E
5|$|Many Belgians were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{magazine}} {{due to its}} {{connections with}} Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; La Soir and La Cité publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while Le Quotidien and Le Drapeau Rouge specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; {{it is possible that}} he was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.|$|E

Jesse convinces Will to use Vocal Adrenaline's methodology, which is to identify the club's best performer and center the entire performance on that person, and Will decides to hold auditions to determine who will be featured. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) all audition, with Jesse and Will as judges. Jesse is <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performances by Santana, Kurt and Mercedes, while he praises his former girlfriend Rachel's performance. He tells Will that Rachel is the clear winner, which angers the other three. Ultimately, Will decides to ignore Jesse's advice and instead plans to do for Nationals what brought them victory at the Regionals competition: having the whole group sing original songs.|$|E
5|$|Andrić was {{appointed}} Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. In 1934, Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul {{was established to}} rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić's back, {{in his capacity as}} ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić's position was an extremely difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park service and their policies.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} cricketers, Hobbs did not {{immediately}} join the army, but worked in a munitions factory, possibly as a clerk. Writing later, Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up, but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be, and was conscious {{of the need to}} care for his family. From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at Westminster School, and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for Idle in the Bradford Cricket League. The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford, when all other such cricket had ceased, was controversial. Several clubs hired top-class professionals and matches became very popular. Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated, Hobbs never reached the expected heights, averaging 36.63 throughout the 1915 season. But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke, who was <b>highly</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employment of professionals, and John Booth, the president of the Bradford League. Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter, but was instrumental in recruiting Frank Woolley to play in the league. He continued to play for Idle in 1916, and was more successful, scoring 790 runs at 52.60 and taking 65 wickets at 6.27. But his conscription after the season into the Royal Flying Corps ended his regular cricket in the league.|$|E
