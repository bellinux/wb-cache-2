The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a granular body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and grained. Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early developmental stage). The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped and transparent, and often contain a <b>granular</b> <b>material.</b> The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or granular. Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are linked in a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of anthrax letters were postmarked September 18, 2001, exactly {{one week after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks.

Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually found; the existence of the other three letters is inferred from the pattern of infection.

500|$|In {{the first}} images of Titan's surface taken by Earth-based telescopes {{in the early}} 2000s, large regions of dark terrain were {{revealed}} straddling Titan's equator. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cassini, these regions were thought to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons. Radar images captured by the Cassini spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes, up to [...] high about a kilometer wide, and tens to hundreds of kilometers long. Dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction. In the case of Titan, steady zonal (eastward) winds combine with variable tidal winds (approximately 0.5 meters per second). The tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan's atmosphere, which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the Moon on Earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator. This wind pattern, it was theorized, causes <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west-to-east. The dunes break up around mountains, where the wind direction shifts.|$|E
40|$|We have {{attempted}} a multiscale quantification {{of the internal}} structure of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> The internal structure of <b>granular</b> <b>materials,</b> i. e., the geometrical information on granular particles and their spatial arrangement, was described mathematically on the particle scale using Voronoi-Delaunay tessellations. These tessellations were further modified into two cell systems: a solid cell system and a void cell system, with the internal supporting structure properly reflected. By doing so, the two cell systems were geometrically and physically significant. Taking solid/void cells as the microscopic basic elements, the behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> was expressed as the volumetric average of the microcell behavior. Macroscopically, the internal structure could be characterized by the statistical measures from the geometry of the microcells. Our approach was used to investigate the anisotropic behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> A study on the void cells explains how the spatial arrangement affects the strength and dilatancy of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> A new anisotropic fabric tensor was defined based on the void cell anisotropy. The correlation between the anisotropic fabric tensor and the macro behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> was verified with numerical simulations.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at three length scales. At the smallest length scale, the grain-scale, we study inter-particle forces and "force chains". Inter-particle forces are the natural building blocks of constitutive laws for <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> Force chains are a key signature of the heterogeneity of granular systems. Despite their fundamental importance for calibrating grain-scale numerical models and elucidating constitutive laws, inter-particle forces have not been fully quantified in natural <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> We present a numerical force inference technique for determining inter-particle forces from experimental data and apply the technique to two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems under quasi-static and dynamic load. These experiments validate the technique and {{provide insight into the}} quasi-static and dynamic behavior of <b>granular</b> <b>materials.</b> At a larger length scale, the mesoscale, we study the emergent frictional behavior of a collection of grains. Properties of <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at this intermediate scale are crucial inputs for macro-scale continuum models. We derive friction laws for <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> at the mesoscale by applying averaging techniques to grain-scale quantities. These laws portray the nature of steady-state frictional strength as a competition between steady-state dilation and grain-scale dissipation rates. The laws also directly link the rate of dilation to the non-steady-state frictional strength. At the macro-scale, we investigate continuum modeling techniques capable of simulating the distinct solid-like, liquid-like, and gas-like behaviors exhibited by <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> in a single computational domain. We propose a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for <b>granular</b> <b>materials</b> with a viscoplastic constitutive law. The constitutive law uses a rate-dependent and dilation-dependent friction law. We provide a theoretical basis for a dilation-dependent friction law using similar analysis to that performed at the mesoscale. We provide several qualitative and quantitative validations of the technique and discuss ongoing work aiming to couple the granular flow with gas and fluid flows. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Chromatography can be {{described}} as a mass transfer process involving adsorption. [...] HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid and a sample mixture through a column filled with adsorbent, leading to the separation of the sample components. The active component of the column, the adsorbent, is typically a <b>granular</b> <b>material</b> made of solid particles (e.g. silica, polymers, etc.), 2–50 μm in size. [...] The components of the sample mixture are separated from each other due to their different degrees of interaction with the adsorbent particles. [...] The pressurized liquid is typically a mixture of solvents (e.g. water, acetonitrile and/or methanol) and is referred to as a [...] "mobile phase".

These interactions are physical in nature, such as hydrophobic (dispersive), dipole–dipole and ionic, most often a combination.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{earliest}} days of MGP operations, coal tar was considered a waste and often disposed into the environment in and around the plant locations. While uses for coal tar developed by the late-19th century, the market for tar varied and plants that could not sell tar at a given time could store tar for future use, attempt to burn it as fuel for the boilers, or dump the tar as waste. Commonly, waste tars were disposed of in old gas holders, adits or even mine shafts (if present). Over time, the waste tars degrade with phenols, benzene (and other mono-aromatics – BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released as pollutant plumes that can escape into the surrounding environment. Other wastes included [...] "blue billy", which is a ferroferricyanide compound—the blue colour is from Prussian blue, which was commercially used as a dye.
