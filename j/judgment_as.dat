5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E

At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> {{well as in the}} execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the Decretals and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.|$|E

25|$|It {{is good to}} {{remember}} that all these documents were written by humans, who used human <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> to whether to note something. For example, once in Europe, German air raids and picking up dead bodies from the sea were fairly common occurrences. At some point, they became too common to report. The Deck Log might mention an air raid on one day but the War Diary might make no mention of it. A week later, the opposite might be true. The clearest picture comes from reading all the documents.|$|E
25|$|The Last Judgement {{was painted}} by Michelangelo from 1535 to 1541, between two {{important}} historic events, the Sack of Rome by mercenary {{forces of the}} Holy Roman Empire in 1527 and the Council of Trent which commenced in 1545. The work was designed on a grand scale, and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel. The painting depicts {{the second coming of}} Christ on the Day of <b>Judgment</b> <b>as</b> described in the Revelation of John, Chapter 20. High on the wall is the heroic figure of Christ, with the saints clustered in groups around him. At the bottom left of the painting the dead are raised from their graves and ascend to be judged. To the right are those who are assigned to Hell and are dragged down by demons.|$|E
40|$|I: www. olivialadinig. comComplexity <b>judgments</b> <b>as</b> {{a measure}} of event {{salience}} 2 This study investigates potential differences between musicians and non-musicians in their perception of meter. Listeners {{with a variety of}} musical backgrounds were asked to judge the complexity of rhythms with 4 / 4 time signature in a Web-based perception experiment (N = 101). The complexity judgments were used to derive salience values for each position in the rhythms. Both groups showed very similar judgments regarding the influence of the levels of metrical (hierarchical) processing. Further, both groups displayed an influence of the absolute position of an event in a bar (serial position effect). Listeners in both groups perceived a rhythm as more complex when syncopation occurred on an early beat of a bar than when syncopation occurred on the last beat (primacy effect). This primacy effect could be observed on the subbeat level as well, and additionally, a rise in salience for events {{at the end of a}} bar was found (recency effect). We propose to update the Longuet-Higgins model of syncopation with these empirically derived values.

25|$|Generally {{the courts}} have taken a deferential {{approach}} to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers {{at the expense of}} others, {{the courts have}} held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse to second-guess unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.|$|E
25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee's <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.|$|E
25|$|Having {{come to her}} {{literary}} maturity at a {{time when}} the ubiquitous and unvarying stated defence of the novel was its educative power, Maria Edgeworth was among the few authors who truly espoused the educator's role. Her novels are morally and socially didactic in the extreme. A close analysis of the alterations which Edgeworth's style underwent when it was pressed into the service of overt didacticism should serve to illuminate the relationship between prose technique and didactic purpose in her work. The convention which Maria Edgeworth has adopted and worked to death is basic to the eighteenth-century novel, but its roots lie in the drama, tracing at least to the Renaissance separation of high and low characters by their forms of speech. Throughout the eighteenth-century drama, and most noticeably in the sentimental comedy, the separation becomes more and more a means of moral <b>judgment</b> <b>as</b> well as social identification. The only coherent reason for Edgeworth's acceptance is the appeal of didactic moralism. In the first place, she is willing to suspend judgment wherever the service of the moral is the result. Everything else may go, so long as the lesson is enforced. the lesson might be a warning against moral impropriety, as in Miss Milner's story, or against social injustice, as in The Absentee. Furthermore, the whole reliance on positive exemplars had been justified long before by Steele, who argued that the stage must supply perfect heroes since its examples are imitated and since simple natures are incapable of making the necessary deductions from the negative exemplars of satire.|$|E
