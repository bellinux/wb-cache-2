25|$|Where {{radioactive}} contamination is present, a gas mask, <b>dust</b> <b>mask,</b> or good hygiene practices may offer protection, {{depending on the}} nature of the contaminant. Potassium iodide (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations due to slower uptake of ambient radioiodine. Although this does not protect any organ other than the thyroid gland, their effectiveness is still highly dependent on the time of ingestion which would protect the gland for the duration of a twenty-four-hour period. They do not prevent acute radiation syndrome as they provide no shielding from other environmental radionuclides.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the dose {{is caused by the}} decay of the polonium (218Po) and lead (214Pb) daughters of 222Rn. [...] By controlling exposure to the daughters the radioactive dose to the skin and lungs can be reduced by at least 90%. This can be done by wearing a <b>dust</b> <b>mask,</b> and wearing a suit to cover the entire body. Note that exposure to smoke {{at the same time as}} radon and radon daughters will increase the harmful effect of the radon. In uranium miners radon has been found to be more carcinogenic in smokers than in non-smokers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} is to ensure the proper selection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). They cover determining, acquiring, using, inspecting and maintaining, and posting for common types of PPE.

They apply to workers, their supervisors, and others overseeing their activities. ...|$|R
50|$|With {{such a high}} {{concentration}} of air pollutants, government authorities warned residents of health symptoms, such as coughing and headaches. Citizens were advised to wear protective masks and use air purifiers. Many sanitation workers were required to wear <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> during work early in the morning. Schools were closed as the government ordered children to stay indoors, and reduce outdoor activities as much as possible.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> is a {{flexible}} pad held over {{the nose and}} mouth by elastic or rubber straps to protect against dusts encountered during construction or cleaning activities, such as dusts from drywall, brick, wood, fiberglass, silica (from ceramic or glass production), or sweeping. A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> can also be worn to protect against allergens. A <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> is worn {{in the same fashion}} as a paint mask or surgical mask, but it is dangerous to confuse the three because they each protect against specific airborne dangers. Using the wrong mask for a job can present a significant and possibly deadly danger as many dust masks with widely varied levels of protection may look similar, and even masks that do not protect against dust at all, such as paint masks and surgical masks. Misfitting masks are also a danger as they allow material to bypass the mask entirely. A correct fit may not be as critical in masks that are intended to protect against splattering liquids or mists. Dust masks are manufactured to protect against only certain dangers, and do not protect against chemicals such as vapors and mists. For this reason, it is dangerous to confuse dust masks with paint masks.|$|E
50|$|Jesmonite is {{considered}} a low hazard material. The finished composite emits no toxic fumes. The mixing process requires no harmful solvents. However, the mixing should be performed with rubber gloves, eye protection, and <b>dust</b> <b>mask,</b> and should {{take place in a}} well-ventilated area. Cleanup is performed with water.|$|E
50|$|Diatomaceous earth {{can also}} be used as a home flea {{treatment}} in lieu of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory treatments or insecticides which carry with them a risk of poisoning for both humans and other animals. However, diatomaceous earth dust is harmful to pets and people when inhaled, requiring use of a <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> to apply.|$|E

50|$|Some {{accessories}} {{may actually}} be consumables, for example a tool rental company might include <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> and sanding belts with the rental of a Floor Sander.

50|$|Older herbaria {{specimens}} {{may have}} been treated with toxic chemicals including lead, mercury, and arsenic to prevent pests. Handlers wear nitrile gloves and work in a well ventilated room when working with specimens prepared earlier than 1989. The card on which the specimen is mounted and the specimen itself may contain the chemicals. The dust on herbaria sheets may be contaminated, so conservators wear a <b>dust</b> <b>mask</b> and use a dust extractor or fume cupboard when cleaning.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>dust</b> <b>masks</b> include {{improvements}} such {{as having}} two straps behind the head (one upper and one lower), having a strip of aluminum on the outside across {{the bridge of the}} nose that can be bent for a custom fit, and having a strip of foam rubber on the inside across the bridge of the nose to ensure a good seal even if the aluminum on the outside does not fit.|$|R
