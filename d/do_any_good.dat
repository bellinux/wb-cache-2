25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good.</b> I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin {{had joined}} Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, {{he was one}} of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was {{initially}} wary, and considered Chaplin a [...] "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" [...] who [...] "looked much too shy to <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> in the theatre." [...] However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.|$|E

60|$|Harcourt very plainly {{told him}} {{that a man who}} {{scribbled}} never <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> at the bar. The two trades, he said, were not compatible.|$|R
2500|$|He added, “In another 100 years, the Vietnamese {{will look}} back at the war and feel shameful. We should not dwell on it as it will not <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> for Vietnam’s future. My main concern at the moment is Vietnam's {{position}} on the world map.” Kỳ said that he only wanted to help build up Vietnam and promote national harmony, and assailed critics of his return, saying that “those who bear grudges only care about themselves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing an {{escalating}} {{insurgency in}} the south of Thailand, Surayud urged the media to paint a more positive picture of the violence. [...] "Truthful words that may not be beneficial nor <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> to the public should be avoided," [...] noted Surayud to the Press Council of Thailand. [...] He was contradicted by Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang, who noted that he couldn't think of any news about the conflict in the South that could or should not be reported by the media.|$|E
2500|$|After much thought, I {{decided to}} take this way out. It took more thought than anyone can think possible. It started about a week ago, when I {{began to think of}} a {{way to get out of}} this. Running away would not <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good,</b> the police would find me where ever I went and would bring me back to it all. No, Mother and Daddy are not to blame, it is just me. If I had done what they told to do this would have never happened. Studying instead of playing around, going out with the people in my age group instead of staying home and dreaming...." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's no good wishing anything, Mary. I don't think wishing ever <b>did</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> yet. If I {{might have}} my wish, I shouldn't {{know how to}} have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{not have}} it read. The author who <b>does</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> must be elected by suffrages at least as {{honestly}} obtained as those {{of a member of}} Parliament." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dyer further {{stated that}} his {{intentions}} {{had been to}} strike terror throughout the Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the [...] "rebels". He {{said he did not}} stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that a little shooting would not <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good.</b> In fact he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted. He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: [...] "Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Union {{troops were}} rearranging their lines on June 21 in {{preparation}} for their mission against the railroad, they received a surprise visitor, President Abraham Lincoln, who had traveled by water and landed at City Point, Grant's newly established headquarters. He told Grant, [...] "I just thought I would jump aboard a boat and come down and see you. I don't expect I can <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good,</b> and in fact I'm afraid I may do some harm, but I'll just put myself under your orders and if you find me doing anything wrong just send me right away." [...] After discussing strategy with Grant, Lincoln visited some of the VI Corps troops who would participate in the upcoming battle.|$|E
2500|$|In Christian theology, {{people are}} created good {{and in the}} image of God but have become {{corrupted}} by sin, which causes them to be imperfect and overly self-interested. Reformed Christians, following the tradition of Augustine of Hippo, believe that this corruption of human nature was brought on by Adam and Eve's first sin, a doctrine called original sin. Reformed theologians emphasize that this sinfulness affects all of a person's nature, including their will. This view, that sin so dominates people that they are unable to avoid sin, has been called total depravity. In colloquial English, the term [...] "total depravity" [...] can be easily misunderstood to mean that people are absent of any goodness or unable to <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good.</b> However the Reformed teaching is actually that while people continue to bear God's image and may do things that appear outwardly good, their sinful intentions affect all of their nature and actions so that they are not pleasing to God.|$|E

6000|$|... "We can {{do nothing}} more tonight," [...] he said. [...] "You may well imagine that if I saw the least chance of <b>doing</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> I should not be {{standing}} here, but nothing can be done till morning." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors of your house unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car so your child won't have a car accident which won't <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or pushed open for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need to change your password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a physical lock.|$|E

6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] Leonard warned him. [...] "You {{may cause}} {{a good deal}} of trouble without <b>doing</b> <b>any</b> <b>good.</b> Remember that you're only here on trial and {{accountable}} {{to the rest of the}} directors. If necessary, the power you're overstraining could be withdrawn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} one ever <b>does</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> by {{starving}} {{as long as}} there is bread to eat. This isn't a romantic sort of thing, this payment of rents; but we ought to try and find out what a man really owes." ...|$|R
