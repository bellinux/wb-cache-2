5000|$|An <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> is [...] "a {{theory that}} offers {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} better help people learn and develop." [...] Instructional theories focus on how to structure material for promoting the education of human beings, particularly youth. Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: behaviorism, the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; cognitivism, the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and constructivism, the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge. <b>Instructional</b> <b>theory</b> is heavily influenced by the 1956 work of Benjamin Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, {{and the results of}} his Taxonomy of Education Objectives—one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. One of the first instructional theorists was Robert M. Gagne, who in 1965 published Conditions of Learning for the Florida State University's Department of Educational Research.|$|E

40|$|The {{steady and}} {{consistent}} growth of online {{learning and the}} rapid development of Web 2. 0 technologies such as wikis and blogs have led to innovative methods of training and instruction. As a result, continuing {{research is needed to}} develop and validate <b>instructional</b> design <b>theories</b> and models that support teaching and learning in today 2 ̆ 7 s technology-rich learning environment. The goal of this research was to refine the Creating Online Learning Communities for Adults (COLCA) <b>instructional</b> design (ID) <b>theory</b> by using the theory to design an online faculty development course. A formative research design guided the investigation. Formative research seeks to identify improvements for an <b>instructional</b> design <b>theory</b> based on a designed instance of the theory, in this case an online faculty development course in Web 2. 0 tools and techniques. This research is a designed case applying the COLCA <b>instructional</b> design <b>theory</b> to an online faculty development course.

40|$|Enrollment {{in online}} courses is {{increasing}} {{at a much}} higher rate than enrollment in on campus courses. Initially, online systems were developed by moving course content from in-class courses as is to an online platform. Later, Web 2. 0 technology was implemented in order to improve students’ online engagement. These systems considered all students as one homogeneous group and ignored the fact that different students learn in different ways and at different speeds. Later, adaptive online learning systems were developed {{based on the assumption that}} if the instructional approach matches the student learning style, student performance and experience will improve. The use of these systems yielded mixed results because there is no agreement on what, how, and when to adapt instructions. The problem is that there is still a lack of empirical evidence about which online learning system’ design is the most effective, efficient, and engaging. There were two goals for this study. The first was to develop a new <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> and design model suitable for personalizing and adapting online learning. The first goal was achieved by developing student personalized, adaptive, and comprehensive e-learning spaces <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> and design model. This theory is based on finding the best fit among student characteristics, knowledge domain objectives, and technology used in delivering the online course. The second goal was to implement the newly developed theory and design model in an e-learning system prototype. This goal was achieved by developing and internally validating the e-learning system prototype by utilizing a panel of five instructional design experts. The Delphi method was used to solicit input from the expert panel in three rounds of validation. The validation process resulted in the experts’ consensus that the prototype incorporated the <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> and design model well and that this <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> holds the promise of increasing online learning courses’ effectiveness, efficiency, and student engagement...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Mathematics Education), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a local theory {{explaining}} the relationship between metacognitive language and networks as constructs of a local <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> in the context of a fourth-year intermediate phase mathematics education methodology module. The local <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> was designed to facilitate an adapted lesson study through a problem-based learning instructional philosophy. A problem-based learning task was then designed outlining the education needs and resources of a South African primary school, characteristic of schools in a rural area. In particular the task describes a fictitious teacher’s concern for teaching a Grade 6 mathematics class the concept of place value. Two groups of students, who volunteered to participate in this research, collaboratively designed and presented research lessons across two educational design-based research cycles for two rural schools in North West, as a form of service learning. In implementing the local <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> phases, participants were required to follow the lesson study approach by investigating, planning, developing, presenting, reflecting, refining and re-presenting the research lesson and its resources. These design sessions were videorecorded, transcribed and then coded in Atlas. ti through interpretivistic and hermeneutic analysis. The coded data were then imported into NodeXL to illustrate embedded networks. Not only social network data but also metacognitive network data were visualised in terms of metacognitive networks. The results show that across the local <b>instructional</b> <b>theory</b> phases, constructs of metacognition, metacognitive language and networking emerged on a social (stratum 1), interpersonal (stratum 2) and social-metacognitive (stratum 3) level. Collectively, these strata form the architecture of the theory of metacognitive locale that explains the relationship between the constructs. The findings suggest that when students express their metacognitive processes through a metacognitive language (e. g. I am thinking or feeling), their interpersonal metacognitive networks develop into shared metacognitive experiences which foster their metacognitive locale, a dimension of their metacognitive language and networking.
