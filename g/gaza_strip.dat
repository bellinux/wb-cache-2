5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> the West Bank and East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E
5|$|Many Gazans {{worked in}} the Israeli service {{industry}} when the border was open, but after Israel's 2005 disengagement from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> this source of jobs disappeared.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, {{a report}} by the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce called for the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> to be {{recognized}} as an economic disaster area after it concluded that the Israeli Operation Pillar of Defense caused approximately $300 million in economic damage.|$|E
5|$|Khalil al-Wazir {{was born}} in 1935 to Muslim parents {{in the city of}} Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were {{expelled}} in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of fedayeen to harass Israelis at military posts near the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
5|$|According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics evaluations, in 2015 the Palestinian {{population}} of the West Bank was approximately 2.9 million {{and that of the}} <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> was 1.8 million. Gaza's population is expected to increase to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.|$|E
5|$|During {{factional}} clashes {{across the}} <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> in June 2007 which ended with Hamas gaining control over that territory, {{at least four}} paramilitaries from Hamas and Fatah were killed in Deir al-Balah. On 2 January 2009, Deir al-Balah was shelled by the Israeli Army {{as part of its}} month-long offensive Operation Cast Lead.|$|E
5|$|Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, {{becoming}} {{a part of}} Mandatory Palestine. As {{a result of the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a blockade on the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{there were}} 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were {{run by the}} Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 {{students}} were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> revealed {{that there was a}} nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology, science labs and extra curricular activities.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops {{withdrew from}} Bethlehem, {{and three days}} later the city came under the {{complete}} administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in conformance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's {{cultural}} center with {{the objectives of}} promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art {{in all of its}} forms. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its {{military}} and settlements from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> including the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip {{adjacent to the}} border with Egypt, {{as part of its}} unilateral disengagement plan. Since the Palestinian organization, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006, it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization Fatah.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bethlehem {{hosted the}} largest {{economic}} conference {{to date in}} the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince {{more than a thousand}} businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.|$|E
5|$|Jamal al-Durrah (born c. 1963) was a {{carpenter}} and house painter before the shooting. Since then, {{because of his}} injuries, he {{has worked as a}} truck driver. He and his wife, Amal, live in the UNRWA-run Bureij refugee camp in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons, including a boy, Muhammad, born two years after the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Landmarks in Gaza {{include the}} Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then {{a mosque in}} the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders {{transformed}} it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b>|$|E
5|$|Omar Mukhtar Street is {{the main}} road {{in the city of}} Gaza running north-south, {{branching}} off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.|$|E
5|$|Palestine Stadium, the Palestinian {{national}} stadium, {{is located}} in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. It serves {{as the home of}} the Palestine national football team, but home games have been played in Doha, Qatar. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{predominance}} of orthodox Islam in Palestine, the region contained numerous domed structures dedicated to Muslim patron saints, among which was the Mosque of al-Khidr in Deir al-Balah. In March 2016, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> began {{the restoration of the}} Mosque of al-Khidr with financial support from UNESCO and the Nawa Foundation. The project aims to convert the mosque-tomb into a children's cultural library.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
5|$|Tubas was {{transferred}} to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) control in 1995 under the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> During the Jordanian and Israeli periods, the city was under {{the administration of the}} Nablus Governorate, but in 1996, the PNA declared Tubas and the immediate area to be an electoral district, and later, an independent administrative area—the Tubas Governorate.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{became a}} refugee when {{his family was}} {{expelled}} from Ramla during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and began leading a minor fedayeen force in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in Algeria. He {{played an important role}} in the 1970–71 Black September clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined the PLO in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired between 3,970 and 4,228 rockets, {{from light}} truck-mounts and single-rail man-portable launchers. About 95% {{of these were}} 122mm (4.8in) Syrian-manufactured M-21OF type {{artillery}} rockets which carried warheads up to 30kg (66lb) and had a range of 20km, perhaps up to 30km (19mi). Hamas has launched 122-mm Grad-type Katyusha rockets from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> against several cities in Israel, although they are not reported to have truck-mounted launchers. Although Katyusha originally referred to the mobile launcher, today the rockets are {{often referred to as}} Katyushas.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank {{as part of}} a tour {{focusing}} on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp. She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The {{agreement}} called for Palestinian {{administration of the}} <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.|$|E
5|$|The Rasheed Coastal Road {{runs along}} Gaza's {{coastline}} and connects {{it with the}} rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah was a relatively large village. The influx of Palestinian refugees from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp in the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.)</b> Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E
5|$|Al-Shifa Hospital ("the Cure") {{was founded}} in the Rimal District by the British Mandate {{government}} in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered {{the establishment of a}} second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to link up with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E
