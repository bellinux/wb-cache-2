During the National Health Interview Survey of 1989, a special questionnaire on digestive diseases was administered to 41, 457 randomly selected individuals. Data were retrieved from public use tapes provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. Odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression after adjustment for sample weights in the survey. RESULTS. Of adult US residents, 10 % reported having physician-diagnosed ulcer disease, and one third of these individuals reported having an ulcer in the past year. Old age, short education, low family income, being a veteran, and smoking acted as significant and independent risk factors. Gastric and duodenal ulcer occurred in both sexes equally often. Duodenal ulcer was more common in Whites than non-Whites, while gastric ulcer was more common in non-Whites. CONCLUSIONS. The age-related rise and socioeconomic gradients of peptic ulcer represent the historic scars of previous infection rates with Helicobacter pylori.

The Al-doped ZnO nanostructures were synthesized by co-precipitation method with varying aluminium concentrations. The as- synthesized product was characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The threshold field required to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> density of ~ 1 µA/cm 2 was observed to be ~ 2. 0 V/µm and ~ 2. 3 V/µm for Al-doped ZnO nanostructures synthesized with aluminium concentrations of 1 % and 3 %, respectively. The Fowler- Nordheim (F-N) plots for both the specimens exhibit non-linear behaviour, which is observed to be specimen dependent. The non-linearity observed in the F-N plots has been interpreted {{on the basis of}} the theory of electron emission from semiconductor emitters. The field enhancement factors, estimated from the slope of the F-N plots, are found to be ~ 9. 3 x 103 and 3. 9 x 103 for 1 % and 3 % Al-doped ZnO emitters, respectively. The high values of the field enhancement factor suggest that the emission is from the nanostructures. The emission current stability measured at the preset value of ~ 2 µA over a period of more than three hours is found to be fairly stable.

However, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the most powerful weapon for accelerating economic development in Bangladesh.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) is {{presently}} being assembled in low-earth orbit (LEO) operating high voltage solar arrays (- 160 V max, - 140 V typical {{with respect to}} the ambient atmosphere). At the station's present altitude, there exists substantial ambient plasma that can interact with the solar arrays. The biasing of an object to an electric potential immersed in plasma creates a plasma "sheath" or non-equilibrium plasma around the object to mask out the electric fields. A positively biased object can collect electrons from the plasma sheath and the sheath will <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> from the surrounding plasma. This parasitic current can enter the solar cells and effectively "short out" the potential across the cells, reducing the power that can be generated by the panels.

40|$|The Microthrust project aims {{to deliver}} an {{efficient}} and scalable electric propulsion system for very {{small form factor}} satellites. For this aim, a thruster chip (THC) is being developed at EPFL, Switzerland, that uses a strong electric field to accelerate charged particles from hollow ‘needles’. The particles are emitted from the propellant, a liquid that consists {{of positive and negative}} ions. To propel these charged particles, both an ‘extraction voltage’ is needed that extract the particles from the liquid and an ‘accelerator voltage’ that accelerates and focuses the beam. A small form factor of 80 x 80 x 20 mm is required for the power and control system (PCS) to generate these voltages and control the THC. The voltage of the accelerator plane is defined as 0 V while a voltage is applied to the ‘particle emitter’, so in fact an emitter voltage and an extraction voltage are generated. The emitter voltage, which is typically between 3 kV and 4 kV, is generated using a Royer circuit combined with a voltage doubler. The Royer circuit generates an AC voltage from 12 V DC input through a self-oscillating circuit that is fed in a transformer. A doubler circuit doubles and rectifies this output. To regulate the output voltage, the 12 V supply of the Royer circuit is periodically interrupted using a 16 kHz PWM signal, which is generated by a microcontroller. The controller continuously monitors the emitter voltage and adjusts the PWM signal accordingly based on PID control software. As efficiency was initially not good, a lot of effort has been spent to improve this circuit which eventually succeeded using a careful component selection Extraction voltage is generated from the emitter voltage by using a controllable resistor divider. This is possible since the extractor plane of the thruster chip should not <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>current.</b> The control of this bypass is a similar, but not identical, to the PID control for the emitter voltage. As the spacecraft needs to remain electrically neutral, both a positive and negative stream of particles needs to be emitted simultaneously. Functionality was therefore split among two boards, one creating two opposite emitter voltages of up to 4 kV and the other creating up to four extraction voltages. Communication between boards was done using a serial bus and a state machine as command parser. A graphical user interface on a PC allows user control of the PCS. The PCS is able to produce two opposite emitter voltages and four extractor voltages on two 80 x 80 mm boards with an efficiency of > 50 % above 1 W. The accuracy requirement (1 %) and ripple regarding the emitter voltage has been met, but that of the extraction voltage (0. 1 %) not fully.
